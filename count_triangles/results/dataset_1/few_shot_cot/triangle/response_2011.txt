Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
