Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with only 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with only 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with only 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
