Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2.
            * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 8.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs involving nodes that are smaller than 9.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
        
        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

        This triangle is: [<0, 8, 9>]

        The final answer is [1].
