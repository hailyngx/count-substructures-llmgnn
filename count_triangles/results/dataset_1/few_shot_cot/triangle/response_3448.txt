Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
