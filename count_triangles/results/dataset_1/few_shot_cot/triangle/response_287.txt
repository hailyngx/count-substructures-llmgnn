Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9 as they are larger than 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 1.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no neighbors for Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

    * Node 4:
        Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, and 9 as they are larger than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is larger than 5.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as all pairs have larger nodes.

    * Node 7:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no other pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

    * Node 8:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no other pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

    * Node 9:
        Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is larger than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2] and the unique triangles found are <5, 7, 1> and <6, 7, 5>.
