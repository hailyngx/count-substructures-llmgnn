Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (2, 9, 8) -> 2, 9, and 8 are all 1-hop neighbors of 1, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (3, 4, 5) -> 3, 4, and 5 are all 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (3, 6, 7) -> 3, 6, and 7 are all 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (4, 5, 3) -> 4, 5, and 3 are all 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (4, 9, 1) -> 4, 9, and 1 are all 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (6, 8, 9) -> 6, 8, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of 2, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (5, 4, 2) -> 5, 4, and 2 are all 1-hop neighbors of 3, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Check for the third node:
            - (7, 6, 2) -> 7, 6, and 2 are all 1-hop neighbors of 3, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
