Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the instructions provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
