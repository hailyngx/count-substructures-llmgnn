Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors, no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can form a triangle as there are no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Therefore, by summing up the total triangles from each node, we get:
Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Thus, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
