Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}
