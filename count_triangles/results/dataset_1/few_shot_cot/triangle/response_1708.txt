Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No edges connected to Node 7, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
