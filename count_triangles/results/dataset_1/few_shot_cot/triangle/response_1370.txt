Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
