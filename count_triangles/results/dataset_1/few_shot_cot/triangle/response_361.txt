Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs possible. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs possible. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle. No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs possible. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs possible. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs possible. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs possible. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 4, 8>, <3, 0, 1>]
