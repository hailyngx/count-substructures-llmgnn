Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 3 (Node 2) + 0 + 2 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
