Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9). No other triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
