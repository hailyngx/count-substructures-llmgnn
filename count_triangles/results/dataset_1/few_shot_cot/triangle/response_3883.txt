Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair of nodes smaller than Node 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 7 as they are smaller. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 or 8 as they are smaller. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
