Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, here is the step-by-step calculation for counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

Therefore, the number of triangles and the unique triangles in the given graph are as follows:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4
