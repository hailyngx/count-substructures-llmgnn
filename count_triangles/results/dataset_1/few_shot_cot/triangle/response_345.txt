Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the method described in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 6, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we can consider is (8, 7), but since 7 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
