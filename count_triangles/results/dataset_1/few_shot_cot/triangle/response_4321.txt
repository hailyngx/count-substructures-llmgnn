Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Directly connected in the edge list, both are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Directly connected in the edge list, both are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Directly connected in the edge list, both are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * The only possible pair to consider is (6, 7) but since 6 and 7 are both greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Directly connected in the edge list, both are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
