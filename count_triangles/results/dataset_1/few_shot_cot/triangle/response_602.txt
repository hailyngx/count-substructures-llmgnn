Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are directly connected as (3, 2) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 1).

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 2).

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 3).

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 4).

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 5).

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 7).

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 8).

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node (all pairs involve nodes smaller than 9).

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
