Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) - Both 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
