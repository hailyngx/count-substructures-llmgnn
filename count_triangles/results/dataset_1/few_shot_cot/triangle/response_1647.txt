Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 is directly connected to 7 and forms a triangle with node 7 through the edge (7, 1).
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 is directly connected to 8 and forms a triangle with node 8 through the edge (1, 8).
    * Pair 6: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 7) -> 2 is directly connected to 7 and forms a triangle with node 7 through the edge (2, 7).
    * Pair 10: (2, 8) -> 2 is directly connected to 8 and forms a triangle with node 8 through the edge (2, 8).
    * Pair 11: (2, 9) -> 2 is directly connected to 9 and forms a triangle with node 9 through the edge (2, 9).
    * Pair 12: (3, 6) -> 3 is directly connected to 6 and forms a triangle with node 6 through the edge (3, 6).
    * Pair 13: (3, 9) -> 3 is directly connected to 9 and forms a triangle with node 9 through the edge (3, 9).
    * Pair 14: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 16: (6, 9) -> 6 is directly connected to 9 and forms a triangle with node 9 through the edge (6, 9).
    * Pair 17: (7, 8) -> 7 is directly connected to 8 and forms a triangle with node 8 through the edge (7, 8).
    * Pair 18: (7, 9) -> 7 is directly connected to 9 and forms a triangle with node 9 through the edge (7, 9).
    * Pair 19: (8, 9) -> 8 is directly connected to 9 and forms a triangle with node 9 through the edge (8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

Repeat this process for Nodes 1 to 9:

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 21.

Therefore, there are 21 triangles in the given graph.
        
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [21].
