Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5, as there is no triangle possible.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as 3 is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
