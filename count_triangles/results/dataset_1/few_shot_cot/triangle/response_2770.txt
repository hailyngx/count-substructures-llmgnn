Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9: No possible triangles as there are no other nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
