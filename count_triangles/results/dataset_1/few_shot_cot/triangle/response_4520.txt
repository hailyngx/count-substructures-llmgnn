Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and higher as they are smaller than 1.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 and higher nodes as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 and higher nodes as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 and higher nodes as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 and higher nodes as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
The total count of triangles in the given graph is [1].

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
