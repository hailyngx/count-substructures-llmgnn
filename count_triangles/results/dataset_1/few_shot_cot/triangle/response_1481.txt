Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
