Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as they have no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
