Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 2 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
