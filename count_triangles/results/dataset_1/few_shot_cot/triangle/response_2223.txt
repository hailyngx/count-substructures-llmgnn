Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are also connected.  
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 7), but they are the same node, so this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
