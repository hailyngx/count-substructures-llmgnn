Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
[0, 2, 8], [8, 9, 0]
[0, 8, 9]
[2, 8, 9]
[6, 0, 8]
