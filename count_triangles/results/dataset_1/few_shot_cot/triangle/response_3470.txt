Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1. No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes greater than 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are directly connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are directly connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
