Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No new triangles can be formed using Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 3 has only one neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as there is only one other node connected to Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 8 has 1-hop neighbors smaller than itself.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed using Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
