Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
