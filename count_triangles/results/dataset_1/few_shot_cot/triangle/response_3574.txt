Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs can be combined to form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there aren't enough nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 1 through 6, 8, 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
