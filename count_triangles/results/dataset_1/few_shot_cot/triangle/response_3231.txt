Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the example provided, below is the detailed breakdown of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
