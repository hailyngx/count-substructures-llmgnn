Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for the remaining nodes:

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
