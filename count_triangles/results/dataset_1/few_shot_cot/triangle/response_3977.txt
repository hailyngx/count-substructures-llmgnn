Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
