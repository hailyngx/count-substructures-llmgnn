Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0: No triangles possible as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles formed:
        * <1, 4, 6>
        * <1, 4, 8>
        
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle formed:
        * <3, 5, 8>

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle formed:
        * <4, 5, 7>

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle formed:
        * <5, 7, 9>

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle formed:
        * <1, 8, 9>

* Node 9:
    * Skip pair with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
