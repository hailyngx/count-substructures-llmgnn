Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [8].
