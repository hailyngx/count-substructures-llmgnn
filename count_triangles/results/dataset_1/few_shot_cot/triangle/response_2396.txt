Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7] with unique triangles being <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 3>, <4, 6, 3>, <6, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 9>.
