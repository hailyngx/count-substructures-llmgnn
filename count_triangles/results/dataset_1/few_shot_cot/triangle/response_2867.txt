Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as all its neighbors are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no neighbor greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there is only one other node greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of its neighbors that are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of its neighbors that are greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of its neighbors that are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
