Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process like in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
  - No pairs left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7:
  - No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 8:
  - No pairs left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3. 

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
