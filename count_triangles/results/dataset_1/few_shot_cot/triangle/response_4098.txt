Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the same procedure as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
