Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
