Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * No triangles can be formed using Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed using Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * No triangles can be formed using Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles can be formed using Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
