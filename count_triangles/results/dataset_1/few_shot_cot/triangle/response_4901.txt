Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the example provided, we can now count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 4 and 5.
  * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Triangle <0, 4, 6> formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 7.
  * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 8.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 7 and 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 8 and 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 4 and 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * As Node 5 has no other nodes to form triangles with, no triangles are possible.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * As Node 7 has no other nodes to form triangles with, no triangles are possible.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * As Node 9 has no other nodes to form triangles with, no triangles are possible.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
