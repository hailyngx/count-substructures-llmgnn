Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 0 to form a triangle.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 3 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3 to form a triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 4 to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6 to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
