Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 6>]
