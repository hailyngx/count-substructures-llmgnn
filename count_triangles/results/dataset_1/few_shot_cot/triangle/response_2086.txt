Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The process needs to be continued for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 which have 1-hop neighbors and can potentially form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Similarly, the triangles for Nodes 6, 7, and 8 should be calculated. Upon completion, the total number of triangles in the graph will be found.

[Total number of triangles in the graph is: [2].]
