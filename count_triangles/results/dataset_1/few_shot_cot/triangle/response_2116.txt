Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 has no connections, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
