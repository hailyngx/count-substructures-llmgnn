Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we need to count the triangles for each node following the same process as shown in the example provided. 

Here is the calculation for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 1.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 2.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 4.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 5.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Nodes 6 to 9 do not have any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 3>
<3, 0, 5>

The final answer is [2].
