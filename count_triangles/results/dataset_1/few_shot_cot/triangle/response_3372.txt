Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as no pairs are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all neighbor pairs are already accounted for.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as all pairs with smaller nodes are already considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all neighbor pairs are already accounted for.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
