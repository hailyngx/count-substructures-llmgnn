Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * There are no triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * There are no triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * There are no triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * There are no triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * There are no triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 8.
    * There are no triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * There are no triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.
Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
