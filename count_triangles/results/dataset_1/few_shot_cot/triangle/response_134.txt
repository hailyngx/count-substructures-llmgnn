Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0, as it only has one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2, as it only has one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 5
    * Unique triangles: <3, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8, as it does not have any sets of 2 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9, as there are not enough nodes to form a triangle.

Final answer: [5]
