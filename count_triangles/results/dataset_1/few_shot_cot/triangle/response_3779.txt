Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only two connections.

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed as it has only four connections.

3. Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    - Triangle: (1, 3, 6) - forming a triangle with Node 1 and Node 6.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] (Node 8 forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 6: <1, 3, 6>).
