Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
