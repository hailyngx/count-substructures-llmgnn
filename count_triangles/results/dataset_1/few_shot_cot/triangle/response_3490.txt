Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because 5 is not directly connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because 6 is not directly connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
