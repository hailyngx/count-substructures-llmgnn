Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 3, 1>, <1, 8, 0>, <1, 8, 7>, <7, 8, 9>]
