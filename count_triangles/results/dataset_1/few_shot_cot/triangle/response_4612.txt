Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No further triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

In summary:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
