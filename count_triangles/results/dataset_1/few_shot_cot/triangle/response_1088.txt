Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the methodology described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * Skipped as they have no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
