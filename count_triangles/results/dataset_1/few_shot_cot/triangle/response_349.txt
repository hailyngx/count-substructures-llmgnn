Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No other nodes exist that are 1-hop neighbors of 0 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No other nodes exist that are 1-hop neighbors of 2 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No other nodes exist that are 1-hop neighbors of 3 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they have no connections to other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
