Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 7 are directly connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
