Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Triangle already counted in Node 0 and Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
