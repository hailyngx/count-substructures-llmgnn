Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
