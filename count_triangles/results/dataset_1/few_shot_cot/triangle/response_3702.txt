Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now go through each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 6 are connected directly to 0 but not to each other.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are connected directly to 0 but not to each other.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are connected directly to 0 but not to each other.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 8 are connected directly to 0 but not to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as all its neighbors are connected directly to 0 and not to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as its neighbors are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as the remaining nodes have fewer than 2 nodes greater than the current node number to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
