Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5: No triangles with Node 5 as there are no connected nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7: No triangles with Node 7 as the only pair has both nodes smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9: No triangles with Node 9 as one pair includes a smaller numbered node.

Summing up the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
