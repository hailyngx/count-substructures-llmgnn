Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 5), but since 4 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Final Answer: [5]
