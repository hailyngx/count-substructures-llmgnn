Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
