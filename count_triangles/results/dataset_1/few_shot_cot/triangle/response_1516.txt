Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Also, 6 and 0 are connected. Triangle 0, 4, 6 formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and connected. Also, 6 and 0 are connected. Triangle 0, 5, 6 formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected. Also, 4 and 0 are connected. Triangle 0, 4, 9 formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. Also, 6 and 7 are connected. Triangle 6, 7, 8 formed.
  - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. Also, 6 and 7 are connected. Triangle 6, 7, 9 formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, the answer is [5] in this given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
