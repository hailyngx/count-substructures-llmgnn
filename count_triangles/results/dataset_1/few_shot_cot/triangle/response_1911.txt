Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, I will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected directly as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one node in the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one node in the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with 1 or 2 as they are smaller. No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as each node has less than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
