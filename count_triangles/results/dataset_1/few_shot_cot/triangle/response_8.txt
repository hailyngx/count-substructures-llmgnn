Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
        * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
        * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
        * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
        * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
        * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
        * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
        * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
        * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skipped as there are no pairs to consider or nodes greater than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
