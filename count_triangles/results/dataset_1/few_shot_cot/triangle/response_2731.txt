Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangles can be formed with this pair as the algorithm expects nodes with numbers greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangles can be formed with this pair as the algorithm expects nodes with numbers greater than 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (7, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are:
[<2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 5>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 1>, <8, 4, 9>, <5, 9, 6>, <3, 6, 5>, <8, 4, 9>, <5, 9, 6>]
