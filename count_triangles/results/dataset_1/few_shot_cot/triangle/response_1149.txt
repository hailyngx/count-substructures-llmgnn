Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
