Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed with node 2: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with node 3: <0, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with node 3: <1, 3, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with node 3: <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Triangle formed with node 3: <2, 3, 5>
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Triangle formed with node 4: <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles formed with 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Triangle formed with node 7: <4, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
