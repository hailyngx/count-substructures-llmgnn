Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No possible pairs as Node 1 has no neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 3. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Nodes 7 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Only one pair can be considered: (6, 4) -> Nodes 6 and 4 are connected as (6, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any possible pairs as they involve smaller numbered nodes. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    - Only one pair can be considered: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
