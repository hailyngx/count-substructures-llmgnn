Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangle formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6. No triangle formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 8.
Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
