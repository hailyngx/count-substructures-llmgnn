    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
