Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) - 4 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) - 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 2 are also connected as (8, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) - 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 6), but since 1 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [2].
