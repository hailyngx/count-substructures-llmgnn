Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes, continue to find unique triangles.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
