Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles involving Node 7 can be formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Nodes 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
