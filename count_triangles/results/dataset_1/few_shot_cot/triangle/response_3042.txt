Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are greater than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are greater than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than these to form triangles with.

Now, summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
