Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, here is how we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Node 0 forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Only 1-hop neighbors are 1 and 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
