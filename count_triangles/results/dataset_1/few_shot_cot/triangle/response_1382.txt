Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
