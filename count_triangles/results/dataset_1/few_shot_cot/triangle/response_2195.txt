Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are greater than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
