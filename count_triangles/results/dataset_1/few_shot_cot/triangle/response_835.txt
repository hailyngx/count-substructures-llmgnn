Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
