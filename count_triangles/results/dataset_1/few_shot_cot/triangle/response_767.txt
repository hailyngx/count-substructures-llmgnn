Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 1:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 2:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 3:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 4:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 5:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 6:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 7:
    * Triangles: 
        * <0, 4, 7>

* Node 8:
    * Triangles: None

* Node 9:
    * Triangles: None

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: 
[1]

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <0, 4, 7>.
