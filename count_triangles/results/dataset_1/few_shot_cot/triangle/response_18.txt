Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
