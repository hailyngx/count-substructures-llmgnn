Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no two 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2 and there are no other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 3.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no two 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no two 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no two 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no two 1-hop neighbors connected to Node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <7, 0, 1>, <3, 4, 5>

The final answer is [6].
