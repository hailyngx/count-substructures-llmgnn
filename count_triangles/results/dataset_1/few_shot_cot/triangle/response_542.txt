Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph. 
Output: [9].
