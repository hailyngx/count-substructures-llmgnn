Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.

3. Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.

4. Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.
    
5. Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.
    
6. Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no other connected pairs of its neighbors.

7. Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no other connected pairs of its neighbors.
    
10. Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of its neighbors connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
