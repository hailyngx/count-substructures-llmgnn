Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 4: (1, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 5: (1, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Pair 6: (1, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0, as it's smaller.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
