Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the instructions step-by-step for each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
