Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
