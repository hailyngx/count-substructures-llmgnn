Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) - Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) - Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) - Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
