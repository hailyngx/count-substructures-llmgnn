Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Triangle formed as 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed as 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed as 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Triangle formed as 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Triangle formed as 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Triangle formed as 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
