Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, and 8. <0, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 5, and 9. <0, 5, 9>
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 8, and 9. <0, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Triangle formed with Node 8, 9, and 0. <8, 9, 0>
    * Pair 2: (9, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 8, 9, and 2. <8, 9, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
