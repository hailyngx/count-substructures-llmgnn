Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
        * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pair with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Continue this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

    Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
