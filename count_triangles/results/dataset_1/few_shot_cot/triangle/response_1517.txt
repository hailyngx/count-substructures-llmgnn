1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip (3, 6) as they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with smaller Nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with smaller Nodes.
    * Skip (7, 9) as they are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [7].
