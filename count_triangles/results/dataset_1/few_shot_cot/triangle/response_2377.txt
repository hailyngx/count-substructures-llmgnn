Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1 since they've already been considered.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2 since they've already been considered.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3 since they've already been considered.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5 since they've already been considered.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
