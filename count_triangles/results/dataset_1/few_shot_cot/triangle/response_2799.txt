Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, we will count the triangles formed in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Not considered as nodes 0 and 1 are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No connections to form triangles with other nodes. Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * No connections to form triangles with other nodes. Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * No connections to form triangles with other nodes. Total triangles with Node 6: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No connections to form triangles with other nodes. Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * No connections to form triangles with other nodes. Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
