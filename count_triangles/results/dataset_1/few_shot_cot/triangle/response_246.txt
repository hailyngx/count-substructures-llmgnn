Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) - 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
