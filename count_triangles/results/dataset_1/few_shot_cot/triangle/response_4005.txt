Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (7, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
