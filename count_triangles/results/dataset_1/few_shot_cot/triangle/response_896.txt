1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
