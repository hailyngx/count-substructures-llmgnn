Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method shown earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5's 1-hop neighbors have already been considered in previous steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Node 8's 1-hop neighbors have already been considered in previous steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
