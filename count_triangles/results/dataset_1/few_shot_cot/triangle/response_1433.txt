Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
