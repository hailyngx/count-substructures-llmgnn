Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with edge (3, 6).
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with edge (3, 7).
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with edge (3, 7).
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with edge (6, 8).
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with edge (6, 9).
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with edge (6, 7).
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed with edge (8, 6).
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed as there are no other pairs to consider.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there are no possible triangles involving these nodes.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
