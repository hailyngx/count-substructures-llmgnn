Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 6 are also connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
