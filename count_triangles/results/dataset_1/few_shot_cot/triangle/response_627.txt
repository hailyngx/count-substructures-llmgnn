Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes with smaller numbers.
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
