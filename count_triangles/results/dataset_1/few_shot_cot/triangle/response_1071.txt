Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 0 are also connected as (5, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * No unique triangles can be formed as they are already covered in the above calculations.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 8

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
