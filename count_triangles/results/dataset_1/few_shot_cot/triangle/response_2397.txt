Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because node 2 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because node 2 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
