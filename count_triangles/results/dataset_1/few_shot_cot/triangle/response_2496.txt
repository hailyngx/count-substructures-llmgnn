Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node:

- Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 0.

- Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 1.

- Node 2:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 2.

- Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 3.

- Node 4:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 4.

- Node 5:
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected through edge (2, 5) and (5, 4). Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
  - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are connected through edge (2, 5) and (5, 6). Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>.
  - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are connected through edge (4, 5) and (5, 6). Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
  - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 7: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are connected through edge (8, 5) and (5, 9). Both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5. Triangle formed: <5, 8, 9>.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>).

- Node 6:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 6.

- Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 7.

- Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 8.

- Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found for each node:
- Total triangles in the graph: 3 (<2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>).

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
