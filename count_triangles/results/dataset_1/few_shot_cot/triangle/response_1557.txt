Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 as it is greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Node 2 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or higher. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3 as it's greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 or higher.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with for each of these nodes.
    * Total triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the final answer is the total number of triangles in the graph which is equal to the sum of triangles found for each node:
