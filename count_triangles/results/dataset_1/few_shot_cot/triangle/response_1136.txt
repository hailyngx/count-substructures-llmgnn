Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs that involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [8].
