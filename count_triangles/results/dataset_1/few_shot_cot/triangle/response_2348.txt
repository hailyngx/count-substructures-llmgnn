Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the steps from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as they don't have at least 2 other nodes greater than them.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it doesn't have at least 2 other nodes greater than it.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
