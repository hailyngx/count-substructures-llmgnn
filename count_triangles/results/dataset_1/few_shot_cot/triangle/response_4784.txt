Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Follow this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Then sum up the total triangles found.

Finally, provide the total number of triangles inside brackets [].
