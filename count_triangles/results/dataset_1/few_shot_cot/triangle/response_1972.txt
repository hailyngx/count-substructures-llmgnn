Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph based on the adjacency list and edge list:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
