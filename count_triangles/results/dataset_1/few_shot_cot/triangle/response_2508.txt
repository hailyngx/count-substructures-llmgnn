Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as one of the vertices since there are no other nodes connected to Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no connections to other nodes.

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there is only one adjacent node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no connections to other nodes.

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as both adjacent nodes are not connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
