Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
