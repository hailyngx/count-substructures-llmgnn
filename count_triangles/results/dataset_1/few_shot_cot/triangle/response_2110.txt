Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip since there are no pairs of nodes greater than 8 or 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
Unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 9>
