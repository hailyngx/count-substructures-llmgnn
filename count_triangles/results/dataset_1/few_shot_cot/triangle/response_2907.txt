Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph, we can determine the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but (0, 2) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but (0, 5) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but (0, 6) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with 1, 2, and 0 (from (1, 2) and (0, 2)).
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but (1, 4) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but (1, 8) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 2, 0>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but (2, 3) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but (2, 5) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but (2, 6) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with 3, 8, and 1 (from (3, 8) and (1, 8)).
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but (3, 9) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 8, 1>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but (4, 5) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but (5, 6) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but (5, 8) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but (5, 9) exists in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 8 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 2
* Unique triangles found: 
    * <1, 2, 0> 
    * <3, 8, 1>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
