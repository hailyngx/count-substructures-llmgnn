Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the approach explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
