Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, here are the counts of triangles for each node in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. 
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it does not have two 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 3 as it is smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it does not have two 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node as all relevant pairs are covered by Node 3 and Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it does not have two 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than 9.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it does not have two 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the output is [2].
