Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4 (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5 (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6 (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7 (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
