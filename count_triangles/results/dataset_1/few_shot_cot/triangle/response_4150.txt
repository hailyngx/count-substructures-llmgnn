Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they have fewer than 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
