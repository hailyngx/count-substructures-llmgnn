Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph. 
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - No possible triangles including Node 0 and Node 1. 
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph. 
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph. 
    - No other possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected in the graph. 
    - No other possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected in the graph. 
    - No other possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
