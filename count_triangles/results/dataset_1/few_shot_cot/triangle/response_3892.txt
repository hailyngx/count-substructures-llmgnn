Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> <0, 1, 6>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> <0, 1, 8>
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> <0, 1, 9>
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> <0, 6, 7>
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> <0, 6, 8>
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> <0, 6, 9>
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> <0, 7, 8>
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> <0, 7, 9>
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> <0, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 10

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> <1, 3, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> <2, 3, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> <2, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> <2, 3, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> <4, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> <5, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 10 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 19.

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.
