1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Potential triangle.
  - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Potential triangle.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Potential triangle.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
  - No potential triangles can be formed with other 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
  - No potential triangles can be formed with other 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
  - No potential triangles can be formed with other 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
  - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
  - No potential triangles can be formed with other 1-hop neighbors of Node 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
  - No potential triangles can be formed with other 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  - Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
