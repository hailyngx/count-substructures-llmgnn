Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no other nodes greater than 2 to form triangles with.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes that are greater or not connected to form any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
