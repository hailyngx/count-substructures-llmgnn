Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 4 are also connected as (6, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 9>]
