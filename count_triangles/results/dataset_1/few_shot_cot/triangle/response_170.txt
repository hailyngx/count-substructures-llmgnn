Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected as shown. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown. Triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other but not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.
