Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the process used in the example step-by-step, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as there are no pairs that form triangles with it.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected by the edge (3, 6).
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected by the edge (3, 5).
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * No possible triangles involving these nodes as there are no pairs that form triangles with them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4, 5, or 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4, 5, 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
