Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
