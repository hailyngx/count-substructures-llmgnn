Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph.

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2, and skip any pairs including Node 1 as it is larger than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 7 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
