Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
