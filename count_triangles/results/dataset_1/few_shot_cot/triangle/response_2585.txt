Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 0) and (3, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 1) and (5, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
