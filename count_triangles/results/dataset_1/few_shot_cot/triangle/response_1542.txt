Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1 and does not form a triangle. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2 and do not form triangles.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
