Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 being the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
