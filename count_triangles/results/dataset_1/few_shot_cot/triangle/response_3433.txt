Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 since it is larger than Node 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 since it is larger than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1 or 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 3, or 4 since they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 since they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 since they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 since they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
