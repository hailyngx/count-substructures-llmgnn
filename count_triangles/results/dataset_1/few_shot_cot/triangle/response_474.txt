Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pair (0, 1) as 0 is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4:
    - Skipped as they need at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    - Skip pair (6, 7) as 6 is smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as they need at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
