Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 6:
    - The only pair we could consider is (4, 6), but since 4 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
