Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Skip the only pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip the only pair with Node 9 as it is smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 9 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
