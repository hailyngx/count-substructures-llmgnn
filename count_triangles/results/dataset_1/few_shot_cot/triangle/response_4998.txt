Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected as (1, 3).
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and connected as (1, 7).
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it's smaller.
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, connected as (2, 3).
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
        * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, connected as (4, 6).
        * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, connected as (4, 7).
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, connected as (4, 8).
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
        * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
        * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
        * No pair can be considered as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) = 6.

    Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
