Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the provided example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 and 9: No triangles can be formed since they don't have enough neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
