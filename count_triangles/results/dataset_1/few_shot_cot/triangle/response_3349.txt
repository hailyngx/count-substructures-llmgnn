Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 because they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 because they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 because they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 because they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, or 7 because they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, or 8 because they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: [<2, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>].
