Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
