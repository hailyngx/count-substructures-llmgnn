Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* The process will continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 to calculate the total number of triangles.

Continuing the process as described, we get:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
