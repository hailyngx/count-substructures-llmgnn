Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same method outlined in the example, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 8 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there aren't enough other nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough other nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there aren't enough other nodes to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the only 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
