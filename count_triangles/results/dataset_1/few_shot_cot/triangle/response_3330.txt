Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected as (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 6, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider with Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 5>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 6, 8>)

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 8, 2>)

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider with Nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
