Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbor nodes to form a triangle.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
