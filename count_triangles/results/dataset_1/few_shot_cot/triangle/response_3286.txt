Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 1 are smaller than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 as all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 5 are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 as all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 6 are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7 as all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 7 are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 as all 1-hop neighbor pairs of Node 9 are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are:
[<3, 4, 5> <0, 3, 7>]
