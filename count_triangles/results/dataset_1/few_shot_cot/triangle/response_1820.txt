Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
