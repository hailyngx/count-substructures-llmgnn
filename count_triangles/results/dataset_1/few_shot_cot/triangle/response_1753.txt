Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle {0, 2, 4}
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Triangle {1, 3, 7}
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Triangle {1, 7, 9}
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
