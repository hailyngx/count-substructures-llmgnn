Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 7>]
