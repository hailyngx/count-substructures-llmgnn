Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the given example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph with the provided information:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Skip any pairs that have been already counted in previous nodes.
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 5) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
