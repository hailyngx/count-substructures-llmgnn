Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the graph.
