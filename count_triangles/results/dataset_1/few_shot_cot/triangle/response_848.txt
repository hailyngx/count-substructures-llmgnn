Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 as it has no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 6 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed as there is only one pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 as it has no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
