Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1   <0, 4, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1   <1, 5, 9>

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1   <2, 3, 9>

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7 since they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
\[1 (\text{Node 0}) + 1 (\text{Node 1}) + 1 (\text{Node 2}) + 0 (\text{Node 3}) + 0 (\text{Node 4}) + 0 (\text{Node 5}) + 0 (\text{Node 6}) + 0 (\text{Node 7}) + 0 (\text{Node 8}) + 0 (\text{Node 9}) = 3.\]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 9>.
