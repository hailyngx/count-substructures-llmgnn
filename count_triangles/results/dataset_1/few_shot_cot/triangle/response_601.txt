1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with just one neighbor. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 7. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with just one neighbor. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 9. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
