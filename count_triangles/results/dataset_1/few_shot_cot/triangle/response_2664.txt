Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
