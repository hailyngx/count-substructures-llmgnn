Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example given, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <3, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
