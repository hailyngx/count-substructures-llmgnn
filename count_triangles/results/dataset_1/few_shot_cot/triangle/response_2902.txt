Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
