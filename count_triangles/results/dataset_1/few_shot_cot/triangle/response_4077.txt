    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
