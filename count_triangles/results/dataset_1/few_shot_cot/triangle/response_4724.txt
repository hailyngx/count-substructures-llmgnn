Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 is connected to 6 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 is connected to 3 as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 2, 6>, <6, 9, 3>]
