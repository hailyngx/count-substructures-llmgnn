Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the example step-by-step process, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 8, 9>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<7, 6, 5>  
<8, 6, 9>
