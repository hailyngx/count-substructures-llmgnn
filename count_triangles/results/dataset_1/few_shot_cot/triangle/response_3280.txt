Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other pairs available for Node 2 to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available for Node 3 to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs available for Node 4 to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs available for Node 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs available for Node 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available for Node 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs available for Node 8 or Node 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
