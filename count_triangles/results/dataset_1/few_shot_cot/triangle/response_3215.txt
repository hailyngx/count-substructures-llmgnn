Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs available for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No available pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
