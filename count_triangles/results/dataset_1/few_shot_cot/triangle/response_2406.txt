Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3 to Node 9:
    * Since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3, there cannot be any triangles involving Node 3.
    * Similarly, Nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9 don't form triangles with 2 other greater nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
