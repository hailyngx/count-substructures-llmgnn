Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
