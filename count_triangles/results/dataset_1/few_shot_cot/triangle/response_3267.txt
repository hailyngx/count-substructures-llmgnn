Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 9>]
