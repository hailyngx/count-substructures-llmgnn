Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected as (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected as (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) is in the edge list. No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected as (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 only has one 1-hop neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Since Node 5 only has one 1-hop neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has only one 1-hop neighbor and thus cannot form a triangle with it as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0)
* Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
