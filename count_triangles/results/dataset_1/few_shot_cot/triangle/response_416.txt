Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
