Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No edges connected to Node 2, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
