Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 2 does not have any edges.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 4 doesn't have at least 2 other nodes to form a triangle.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 5 has already participated in other triangles.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 6 doesn't have at least 2 other nodes to form a triangle.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 7 doesn't have at least 2 other nodes to form a triangle.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 8 has already participated in other triangles.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 9 has already participated in other triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
