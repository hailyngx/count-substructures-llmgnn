Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - Since Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors greater than itself, no triangles can be formed starting from Node 2.

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 7 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles starting from Node 5.

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - Skip any pair with Node 5 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8 and Node 9**:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
