Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no neighbors, there are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3,  or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7, as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8, as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
