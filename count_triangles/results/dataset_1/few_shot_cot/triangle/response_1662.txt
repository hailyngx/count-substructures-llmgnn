Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
