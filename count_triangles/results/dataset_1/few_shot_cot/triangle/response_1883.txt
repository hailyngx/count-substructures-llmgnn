Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle since it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle as all pairs of 1-hop neighbors are already covered in previous calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle as all pairs of 1-hop neighbors are already covered in previous calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle as all pairs of 1-hop neighbors are already covered in previous calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
