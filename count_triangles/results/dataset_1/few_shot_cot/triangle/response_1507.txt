Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
