Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Another triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has too few neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has too few neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has too few neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has too few neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has too few neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
