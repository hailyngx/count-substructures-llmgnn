Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with available nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Already counted with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with available nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
