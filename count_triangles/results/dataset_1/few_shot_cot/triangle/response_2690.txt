Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected because there is no edge between them.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No more pairs can form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No more pairs can form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No pairs can be considered as there is only one node adjacent to Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    - Skip the pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than 7.
    - No more pairs can form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No more pairs can form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No pair can be considered as there are no adjacent nodes to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
