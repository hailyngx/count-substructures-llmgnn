Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided:

- Nodes 0, 3, and 4 do not form any triangles.
- For Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>. 
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle: <1, 8, 9>. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- For Node 2:
    * No new triangles as all pairs either involve Node 1 or are not connected.

- For Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Both nodes contribute to the same triangles as Node 1, so no additional triangles are formed.

- For Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle: <7, 6, 9>. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9 do not form any additional triangles as they are all considered previously.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
