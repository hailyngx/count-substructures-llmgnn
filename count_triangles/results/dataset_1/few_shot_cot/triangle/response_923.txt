Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Node 3 is directly connected to Node 0, and Node 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Node 5 is directly connected to Node 6, and Node 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
