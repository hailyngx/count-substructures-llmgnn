Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example with the information provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are all smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are all smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are all smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are all smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are all smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are all smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are all smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
