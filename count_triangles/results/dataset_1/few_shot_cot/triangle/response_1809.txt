Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node:

1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 or 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, or 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
