Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the method provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
