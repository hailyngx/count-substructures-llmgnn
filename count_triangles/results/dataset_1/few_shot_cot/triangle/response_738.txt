Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 2 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 3 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 3). No unique triangles can be formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 5 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 6 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - No unique triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 8 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  - No pairs to check as all nodes connecting to 9 are smaller in value.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
