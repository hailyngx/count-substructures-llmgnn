Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more valid pairs with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No valid pairs with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more valid pairs with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
