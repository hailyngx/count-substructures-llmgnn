Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
  * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
  * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected directly, no triangle.
  * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Not connected directly, no triangle.
  * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Not connected directly, no triangle.
  * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> Not connected directly, no triangle.
  * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
  * Only pairs with nodes greater than 2 are considered.
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = [14].

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
