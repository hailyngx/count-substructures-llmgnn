Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Both nodes have no neighbors, so they cannot form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
