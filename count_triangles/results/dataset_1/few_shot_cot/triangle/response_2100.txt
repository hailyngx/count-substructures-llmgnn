Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as the other 1-hop neighbors of 1 are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as the other 1-hop neighbors of 3 are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as the other 1-hop neighbors of 4 are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as the other 1-hop neighbors of 5 are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as the other 1-hop neighbors of 7 are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
