1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only possible pair we could consider is (7, 5), but since 7 is smaller than 5, this pair will be skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
[<4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <5, 8, 7>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 8, 1>]
