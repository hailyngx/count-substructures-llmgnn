Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles found are: 
[<0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 8>]
