Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected because (1, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected because (1, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 4.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.
    
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
    
[<0, 1, 5>, <5, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 5>]
