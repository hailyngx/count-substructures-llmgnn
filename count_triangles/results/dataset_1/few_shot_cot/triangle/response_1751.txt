Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it is greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * There are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * There are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
