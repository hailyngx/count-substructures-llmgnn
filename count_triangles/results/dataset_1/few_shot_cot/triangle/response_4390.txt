Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are also connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and they are connected as seen in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
