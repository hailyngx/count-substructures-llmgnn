Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes a node smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes a node smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No edges to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No edges to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No edges to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
