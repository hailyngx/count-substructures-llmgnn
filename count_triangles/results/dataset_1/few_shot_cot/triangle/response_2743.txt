Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles to form with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles to form with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles to form with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles to form with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * No triangles to form with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles to form with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles to form with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
