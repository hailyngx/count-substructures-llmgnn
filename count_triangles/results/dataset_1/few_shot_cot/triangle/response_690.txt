Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with the available pairs as they involve smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with the available pair as it involves a smaller numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with the available pairs as they involve smaller numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
