Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same approach as in the example provided.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 5), but since 1 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
