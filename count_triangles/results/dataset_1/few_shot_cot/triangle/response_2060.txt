Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 0 are also directly connected as (9, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs available for Node 2 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available for Node 3 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs available for Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs available for Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available for Node 6 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available for Node 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs available for Node 8 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs available for Node 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
