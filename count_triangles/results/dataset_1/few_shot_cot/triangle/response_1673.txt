Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) = 4.

[4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
