Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, and 8 and 9 share Node 0 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, and 5 and 9 share Node 3 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, and 7 and 9 share Node 3 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
