Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as illustrated in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Triangle formed with nodes 0, 1, and 3. <0, 1, 3>
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Triangle formed with nodes 0, 1, and 8. <0, 1, 8>
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Triangle formed with nodes 1, 7, and 9. <1, 7, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, and 7. <3, 5, 7>
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Triangle formed with nodes 5, 6, and 9. <5, 6, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 9. <7, 8, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
