Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node as it does not have any connected pair of 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
