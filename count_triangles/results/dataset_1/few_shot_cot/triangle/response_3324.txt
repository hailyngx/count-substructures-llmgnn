Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected in the edge list. But there are no other 1-hop neighbors in common with 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected in the edge list. But there are no other 1-hop neighbors in common with 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected in the edge list. But there are no other 1-hop neighbors in common with 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
