Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 9 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 4 since they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 4 since they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 since they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 since they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
