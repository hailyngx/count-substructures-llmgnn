Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

### Counting Triangles:
* Node 0:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangle can be formed because there are not enough nodes connected to Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

### Calculating Total Triangles:
The total number of triangles in the graph is the sum of the triangles obtained for each node:
Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
