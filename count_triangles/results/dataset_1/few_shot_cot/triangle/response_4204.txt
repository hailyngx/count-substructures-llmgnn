Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will now count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles since there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles since there are no pairs with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles since there are no pairs with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles since there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles since there are no pairs with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
