Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * There are no other pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * There are no other pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7), but since 7 is smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * There are no other pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * There are no other pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  
* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
