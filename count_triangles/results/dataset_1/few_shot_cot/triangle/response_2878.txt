Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
  - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3: 
  - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
  - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
  - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
  - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
  - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 8>]
