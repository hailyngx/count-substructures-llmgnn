Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

- **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    - No other pairs are valid for forming triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed as 5, 6, and 4 are connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    - Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 5:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs can form triangles involving Node 5.

- **Node 6:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

- **Node 7:**
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

- **Node 8 and Node 9:**
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
