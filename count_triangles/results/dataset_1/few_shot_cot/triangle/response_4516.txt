Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Node 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 0 and 7, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 2 and 5, and they are connected as shown. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 2 and 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Node 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 3 and 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 4 and 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Node 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of nodes 7 and 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
