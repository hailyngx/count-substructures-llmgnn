Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No edge between 2 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No edge between 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No edge between 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No edge between 1 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but it is smaller, so skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9 are skipped as there are no at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
