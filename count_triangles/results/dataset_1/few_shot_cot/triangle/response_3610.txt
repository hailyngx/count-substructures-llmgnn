Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with higher node numbers than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with higher node numbers than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with higher node numbers than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with higher node numbers than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
