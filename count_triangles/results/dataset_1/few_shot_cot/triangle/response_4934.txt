Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 7, 8 as they are greater than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are greater than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
