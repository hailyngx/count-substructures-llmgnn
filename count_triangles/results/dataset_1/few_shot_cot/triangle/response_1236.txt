Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 1 are also connected as (5, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].

If you would like, I can also provide the list of unique triangles found in this format: <node1, node2, node3>.
