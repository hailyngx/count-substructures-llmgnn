Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge for this pair. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
