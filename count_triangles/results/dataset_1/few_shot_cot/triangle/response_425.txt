Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and node 4 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0 and connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 0 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1 and connected.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 8 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1 and connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 6 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 3 and connected.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and node 8 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 3 and connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 6 and node 9 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 4 and connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 7 and node 9 as they are both 1-hop neighbors of node 6 and connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.  
Thus, the output is [7].
