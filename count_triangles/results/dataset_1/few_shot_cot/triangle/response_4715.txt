Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [0].
