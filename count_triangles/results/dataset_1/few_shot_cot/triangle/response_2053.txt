Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No possible pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 6.
    * No possible pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No possible pairs left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
