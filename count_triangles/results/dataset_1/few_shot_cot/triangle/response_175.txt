Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip all pairs since no other nodes have higher numbers. No triangles possible with Node 1.

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

        Answer: [5]

        The unique triangles found are:
        <3, 5, 9>
        <3, 4, 5>
        <4, 5, 7>
        <5, 8, 9>
        <0, 3, 9>
