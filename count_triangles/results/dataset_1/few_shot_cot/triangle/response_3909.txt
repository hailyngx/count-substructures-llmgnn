Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, here is the breakdown for the given graph to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 0) and (0, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 0) and (0, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 1) and (1, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 1) and (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (8, 1) and (1, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2) and (2, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to not having enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
