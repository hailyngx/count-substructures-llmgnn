Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Nodes 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no 2-hop connections.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no 2-hop connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
