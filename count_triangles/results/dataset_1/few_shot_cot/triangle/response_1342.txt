Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors connected to Node 3, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 9 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles involving Node 7 can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles involving Node 9 can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
