Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <5, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed: <8, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * As Node 9 is the largest numbered node, no triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
