Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
