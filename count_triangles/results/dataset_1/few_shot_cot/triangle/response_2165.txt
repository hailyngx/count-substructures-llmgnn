Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 2) -> Ignored as it's a self-loop and doesn't form a triangle with node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> Ignored as it's a self-loop and doesn't form a triangle with node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (formed with pairs 4 and 5)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> Ignored as it's a self-loop and doesn't form a triangle with node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 3)
* Unique triangles: <4, 3, 5>
* Final Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
