Response:
Following the example provided, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Skip pairs with 5 as there are no triangles.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with 2, as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with 4 or 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
