Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (5, 7) and (4, 7) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (5, 9) and (4, 9) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (5, 7) and (0, 7) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (5, 9) and (0, 9) are in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
