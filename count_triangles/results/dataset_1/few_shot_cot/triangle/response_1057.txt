Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
