Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Final answer: [4]
