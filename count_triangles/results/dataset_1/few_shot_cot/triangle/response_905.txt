Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Nodes 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2 and have been checked.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4 and have been checked.
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5 and have been checked.
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6 and have been checked.
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7 and have been checked.
    * No new triangles can be formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
