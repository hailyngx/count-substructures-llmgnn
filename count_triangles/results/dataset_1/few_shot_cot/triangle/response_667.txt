Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
