Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip node 0 in the pairs.
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip node 3 in the pairs.
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip node 4 in the pairs.
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip node 5 in the pairs.

* Node 6:
    * Skip node 6 in the pairs.

* Node 7:
    * Skip node 7 in the pairs.

* Node 8:
    * Skip node 8 in the pairs.

* Node 9:
    * Skip node 9 in the pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
