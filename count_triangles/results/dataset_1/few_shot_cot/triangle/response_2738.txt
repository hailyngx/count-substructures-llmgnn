Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
