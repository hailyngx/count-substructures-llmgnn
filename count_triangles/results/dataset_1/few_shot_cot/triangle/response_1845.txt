Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected as (2, 9), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected as (3, 9), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected as (6, 9), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected as (6, 9), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: Skipped as they include smaller nodes.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected as (4, 8), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected as (4, 9), forming a triangle.
    * Pair 8: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3, 4, 5: Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes as neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pairs 1, 2, 3, 4: Skipped as they include smaller nodes.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating for the rest of the nodes:
* Node 7: Skipped as it has smaller numbered nodes as neighbors.
* Node 8: Skipped as it has smaller numbered nodes as neighbors.
* Node 9: Skipped as it has smaller numbered nodes as neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
