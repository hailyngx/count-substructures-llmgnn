Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Finally, the answer is [1].
