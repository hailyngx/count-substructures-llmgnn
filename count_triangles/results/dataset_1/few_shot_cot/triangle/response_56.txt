Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles since Node 1 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles since Node 3 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles since Node 4 doesn't have any 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles since Node 5 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles since Node 6 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles since Node 7 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles since Node 8 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles since Node 9 doesn't have any pair of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
