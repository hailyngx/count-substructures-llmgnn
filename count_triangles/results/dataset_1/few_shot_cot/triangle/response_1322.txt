Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * No adjacent nodes to form a triangle with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * No adjacent nodes to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * No adjacent nodes to form a triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No adjacent nodes to form a triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
