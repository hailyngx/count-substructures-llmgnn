Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) - No triangle formed since they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
