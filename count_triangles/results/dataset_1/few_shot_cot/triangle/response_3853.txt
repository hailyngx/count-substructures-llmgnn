Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No further triangles can be formed as the remaining nodes do not have enough pairs to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
