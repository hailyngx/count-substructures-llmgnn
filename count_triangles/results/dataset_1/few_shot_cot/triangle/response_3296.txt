Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
