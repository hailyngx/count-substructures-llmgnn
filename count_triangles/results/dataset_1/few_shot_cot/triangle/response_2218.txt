Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no two other nodes that are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
