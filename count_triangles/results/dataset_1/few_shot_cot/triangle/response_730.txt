Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, no triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * No connections, so no triangles possible.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles possible with just one node.

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * No triangle possible with just one node.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * No triangles possible as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
