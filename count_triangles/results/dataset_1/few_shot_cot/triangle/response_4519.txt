Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
