Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Connected. Triangle formed <1, 2, 4>.
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed <1, 2, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected. Triangle formed <2, 3, 4>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed <4, 6, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8:
    - Not enough nodes to form triangles with them as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Connected. Triangle formed <6, 8, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in this given graph.
