Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Node 1 has no triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Node 2 has no triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Node 3 has no triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Node 4 has no triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Node 5 has no triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Node 6 has no triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Node 7 has no triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Node 8 has no triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Node 9 has no triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
