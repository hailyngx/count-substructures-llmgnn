Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, here is the breakdown of triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, there's no possibility of any triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. No third node to complete the triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * These nodes are skipped because they do not have neighbors greater than themselves to form triangles.

Now, totaling the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
