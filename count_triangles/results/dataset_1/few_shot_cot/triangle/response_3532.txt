Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    * Pairs 1 to 4: (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 7) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 because they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 4 are also directly connected as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they contain smaller nodes than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pairs 1 and 2: (0, 1), (0, 9) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * No more triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 because they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pairs 1 and 2: (0, 1), (0, 5) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
