Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, 5:
    * None of these nodes can form triangles as all their 1-hop neighbors are smaller.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 9 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
