Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it doesn't have enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
