Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list as (9, 2). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list as (9, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

9. Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes larger than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
