Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's go through each node step-by-step to count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
