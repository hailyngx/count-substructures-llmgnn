Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Triangle <0, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle <2, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No edges connected to Node 3, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle <5, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle <6, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has no edges connected to it, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 7.
    * No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
