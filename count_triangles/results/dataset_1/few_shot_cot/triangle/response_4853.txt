Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the method described earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
