Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * No possible triangles.

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <2, 3, 7>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <2, 3, 7>
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <1, 2, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    * No possible triangles.

5. Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <4, 8, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    * No possible triangles.

7. Node 6:
    * No possible triangles.

8. Node 7:
    * No possible triangles.

9. Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    * No possible triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
