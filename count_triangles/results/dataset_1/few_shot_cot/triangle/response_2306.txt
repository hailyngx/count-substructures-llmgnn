Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
