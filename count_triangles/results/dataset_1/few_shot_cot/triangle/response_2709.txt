Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No valid triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Node 3 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - No valid triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No valid triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No valid triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
