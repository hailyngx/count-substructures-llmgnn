Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
