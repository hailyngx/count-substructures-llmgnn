Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 (smaller).
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 (smaller).
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 or 2 (smaller).
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, or 2 or 3 (smaller).
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (smaller).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pair with Node 1 (smaller).
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
