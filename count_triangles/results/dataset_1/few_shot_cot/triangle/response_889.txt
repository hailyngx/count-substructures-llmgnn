Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the instructions given in the example above, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 4 are also directly connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9 are skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
