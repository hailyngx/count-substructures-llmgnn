Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 3) and (2, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (2, 4) and (7, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected as (0, 7) and (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no edges connected to it.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
