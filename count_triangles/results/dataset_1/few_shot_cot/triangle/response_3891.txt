Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * Nodes 5, 6, and 7 don't have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair to consider is (8, 6), and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
