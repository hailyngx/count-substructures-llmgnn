Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph using the step-by-step approach as shown in the previous example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
