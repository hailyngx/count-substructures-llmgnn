Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No more triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3 - Node 9:
    * Following the same process, no more triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
