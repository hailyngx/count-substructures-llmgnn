Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided earlier, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no edges, it can't form any triangles. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
