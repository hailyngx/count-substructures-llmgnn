Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (7, 5) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (8, 9). 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (6, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (7, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (9, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 1 (Node 8) + 0 = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
