Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, summing up all the triangles found for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [2].
