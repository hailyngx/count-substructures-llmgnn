Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 7: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 2, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 1, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <2, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Triangle formed with Node 9: <2, 6, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no common neighbors with an edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has no common neighbors with an edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 8: <6, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <6, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>]
