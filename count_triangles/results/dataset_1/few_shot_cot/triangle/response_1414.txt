Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4 - Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 4 to 9 as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4 to 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
