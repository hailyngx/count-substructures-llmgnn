Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph. Checking the third node to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph. Checking the third node to form a triangle.
        * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph. Checking the third node to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the graph. Checking the third node to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * No new triangles can be formed by the pairs already checked.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the graph. Checking the third node to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * No new triangles can be formed by the pairs already checked.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
