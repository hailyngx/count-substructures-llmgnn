Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No pairs available for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed using Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed using Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
