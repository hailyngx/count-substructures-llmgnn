Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 0 because it's smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since there are no pairs of nodes that are greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to form triangles, all these nodes will not be part of any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
