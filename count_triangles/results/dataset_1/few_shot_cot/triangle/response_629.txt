    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as the possible triangles involving Node 4 have already been counted when considering Node 1 and Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they are not the smallest numbered node in any potential triangle.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 6>]
