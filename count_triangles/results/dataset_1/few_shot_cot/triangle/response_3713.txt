Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's potential to form triangles with its neighbors.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has only one neighbor, which is Node 3. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6: 
    * No need to revisit Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs that involve nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only two neighbors and no additional nodes are available.

* Node 9:
    * No need to revisit Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
