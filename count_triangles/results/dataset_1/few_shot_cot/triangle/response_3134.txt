Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Nothing to evaluate as Node 1 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to evaluate as they are duplicates or involve Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Nothing to evaluate as the only neighbor Node 4 is greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Nothing to evaluate as Node 5 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Nothing to evaluate as the only neighbor Node 4 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair with Node 8 and Node 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to evaluate as the only neighbor of each is smaller than them.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
