Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * The only pair to consider is (5, 0), but since 5 is smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
        * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
