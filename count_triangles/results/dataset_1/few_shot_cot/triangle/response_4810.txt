Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with 1 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with 3 and 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with 5 and 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 9), but since 5 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Now, let's summarize the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
