Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Neither 4 nor 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to check as there are no nodes greater than 2 left.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No pairs left. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No pairs left. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to check as there are no nodes greater than 6 left.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 7 left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they only have one 1-hop neighbor each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
