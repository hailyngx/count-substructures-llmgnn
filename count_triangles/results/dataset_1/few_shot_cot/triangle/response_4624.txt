Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  No connections. 
  Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  No triangles involving Node 2 as all other connected nodes are smaller than 2.
  Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  No triangles involving Node 3 as all connected nodes are smaller than 3.
  Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed. 
  Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  No triangles involving Node 5 as all other connected nodes are smaller than 5.
  Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
  No connections.
  Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  No connections.
  Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  No triangles involving Node 9 as all other connected nodes are smaller than 9.
  Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
