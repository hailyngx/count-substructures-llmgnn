Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node: <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node: <0, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest node: <3, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest node: <5, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no combinations available to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
