Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example provided:

- For Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (0-4-5-6).
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 (0-4-6-5).
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (0-4-5, 0-4-6).

- For Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 (0-5-6-4).
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 (4-5-7-6).
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 (0-5-9-4).
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (0-5-6, 4-5-7, 0-5-9).

- For Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

- For Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with other nodes from Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
