Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, 6, and 9:
    * Cannot form triangles as there aren't at least two other nodes greater than them.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [3].
