Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    - Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller than Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
