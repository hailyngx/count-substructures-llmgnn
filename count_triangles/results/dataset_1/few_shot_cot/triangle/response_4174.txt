Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described before, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with 0, 4, 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * 1 triangle found with Node 0.

- Node 1:
    * No triangles found with Node 1.

- Node 2:
    * No pairs applicable to Node 2.

- Node 3:
    * No pairs applicable to Node 3.

- Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * 0 triangles found with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Triangle formed with 0, 4, 5.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * 1 triangle found with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    * No pairs applicable to Node 6.

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * 0 triangles found with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * 0 triangles found with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * No pairs applicable to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are: 
[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 5>]
