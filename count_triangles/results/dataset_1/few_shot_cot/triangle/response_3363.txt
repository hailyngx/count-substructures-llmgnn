Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, the count of triangles for each node is as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Does not form a triangle with 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with 1.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Does not form a triangle with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 3.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Does not form a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> Does not form a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 5: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> Does not form a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 7: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 8: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 9: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 6 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 13.

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
