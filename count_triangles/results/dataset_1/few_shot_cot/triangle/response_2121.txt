* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
