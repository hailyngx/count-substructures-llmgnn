Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 2 or Node 3, as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
Calculating the total number of triangles by summing up the triangles found for each node: [2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12]

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph, and they can be listed as follows: 
[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <5, 2, 8>, <6, 3, 7>]
