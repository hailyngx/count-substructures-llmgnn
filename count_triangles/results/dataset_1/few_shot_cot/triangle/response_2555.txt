Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair containing Node 0 or 1.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

* Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
