Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided earlier, we can find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
