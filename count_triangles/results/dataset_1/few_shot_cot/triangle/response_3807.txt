Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No potential triangles as there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No potential triangles as there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. 
    * Potential triangle: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. 
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
