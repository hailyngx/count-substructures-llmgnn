Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as Node 0 does not have any 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as Node 2 does not have any 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs possible. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs possible. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs possible. One additional triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as Node 7 only has 1-hop neighbor 5.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs possible. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 only has 1-hop neighbor 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
