Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
