    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
