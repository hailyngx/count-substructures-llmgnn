Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected (1, 4) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected (1, 6) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected (4, 6) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected (4, 6) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected (6, 8) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
