Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Node 1 and Node 2 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Nodes 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - Nodes 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors with a common neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
