    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip both pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * These nodes have been covered in the analysis of previous nodes, no additional triangles are formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 due to smaller numbering.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 7 due to smaller numbering.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
