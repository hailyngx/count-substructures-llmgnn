Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are larger than 0.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are larger than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are larger than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6 as they are larger than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 6 as they are larger than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Node 6 as it is larger than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 7 as it is larger than 6.
    * [Note: No triangles can be formed with larger nodes]
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs as there are no larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no connections (isolated node).

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 7 as it is larger than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
