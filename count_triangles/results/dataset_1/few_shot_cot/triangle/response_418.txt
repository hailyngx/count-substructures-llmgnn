Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, here are the triangles found for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 5>]
