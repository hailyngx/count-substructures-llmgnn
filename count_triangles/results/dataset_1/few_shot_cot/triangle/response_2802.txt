Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Similar to Node 1 and Node 3, there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with any of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
