Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> Not a triangle as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> Not a triangle as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Not a triangle as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Not a triangle as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not a triangle as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Not a triangle as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No possible triangle found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped since they only have one neighbor each, and thus no triangles can be formed with them.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not a triangle as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangle found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangle found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
