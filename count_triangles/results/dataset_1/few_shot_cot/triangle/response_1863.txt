Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 11: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 12: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 14: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 4 or 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 and 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbor nodes, so no triangles.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
