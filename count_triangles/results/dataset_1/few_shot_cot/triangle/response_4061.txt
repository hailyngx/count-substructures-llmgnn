Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs with 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Node 1 doesn't participate in any triangles as the other nodes connected to it are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to form triangles for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors for Node 3, hence no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs to form triangles for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 8 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<9, 5, 8>
