Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the earlier example, here is the breakdown for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (All other nodes) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
