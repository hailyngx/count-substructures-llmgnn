Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, as it is smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, [there are 6 triangles in the given graph.]
