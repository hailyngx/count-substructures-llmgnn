Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
