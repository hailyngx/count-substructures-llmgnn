Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Not a triangle as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Not a triangle as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with other nodes from this starting point.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with other nodes from this starting point.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9 do not have triangles starting from them due to the lack of available pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
