Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7.
    
* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped the analysis as there are no nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
