Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No additional triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped. No additional triangles.

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped due to the absence of nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to the absence of nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 7) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <2, 3, 9>]
