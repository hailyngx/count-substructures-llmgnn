1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
