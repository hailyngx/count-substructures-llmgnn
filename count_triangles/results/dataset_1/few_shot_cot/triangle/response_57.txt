Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step per node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4).
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5).
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8).
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5).
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9).
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipping further calculations for these nodes as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
