Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with (1, 9, 0).
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with (4, 9, 1).
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 2 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 3 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 4 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 5 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 6 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with (1, 9, 7).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 8 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 9 does not have any pairs that form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
