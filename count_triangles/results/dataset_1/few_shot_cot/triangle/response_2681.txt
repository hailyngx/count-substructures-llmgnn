Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
