Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip the pair (1, 2) as it's already counted with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 2 is smaller than Nodes 4, 5, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 3 is smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 4 has smaller or equal nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 5 has smaller nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 6 has smaller nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 7 has smaller nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pair (8, 9) as it's already counted with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as Node 9 has smaller nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
