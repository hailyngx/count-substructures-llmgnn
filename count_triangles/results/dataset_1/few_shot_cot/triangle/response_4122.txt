Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as done in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes with smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No available pairs to form triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No available pairs to form triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No available pairs to form triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there isnâ€™t a pair of nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
