Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No other connected pairs with 2 as one of the nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No connected pairs with 4 as one of the nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No connected pairs with 5 as one of the nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No other connected pairs with 6 as one of the nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No connected pairs with 7 as one of the nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No connected pairs with 8 as one of the nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No connected pairs with 9 as one of the nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
