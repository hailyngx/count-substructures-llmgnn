Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 8 are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 7 are connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 1 are connected as (0, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 2 are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 2 are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 3 and 9 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
