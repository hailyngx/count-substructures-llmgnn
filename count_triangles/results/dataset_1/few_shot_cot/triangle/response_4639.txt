Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided earlier to find all the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor exists for a triangle. No additional triangles found with Node 0.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor exists for a triangle. No additional triangles found with Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * No pairs possible, as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles found with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * No pairs possible, as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 are smaller than 3.
        * No triangles found with Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs possible, as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 are smaller than 4.
        * No triangles found with Node 4.

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs possible, as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles found with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor exists for a triangle. No additional triangles found with Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs possible, as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 are smaller than 7.
        * No triangles found with Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        * No pairs possible, as both 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles found with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs possible, as Node 1 is the only 1-hop neighbor of 9.
        * No triangles found with Node 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

    Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
