Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Answer: [1] 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph: <0, 2, 6>.
