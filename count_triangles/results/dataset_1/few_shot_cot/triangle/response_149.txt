Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
