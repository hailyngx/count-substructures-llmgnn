Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 2 and 5 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
