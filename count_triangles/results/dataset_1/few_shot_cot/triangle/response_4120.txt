Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
            * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
            * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
            * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
            * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
            * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
