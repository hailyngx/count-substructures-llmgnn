Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}
