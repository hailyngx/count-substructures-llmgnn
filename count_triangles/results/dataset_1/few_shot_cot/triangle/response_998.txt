Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
