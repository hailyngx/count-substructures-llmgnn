Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Node 0 is a part of the triangle formed by nodes 5, 0, and 8. Triangle <0, 5, 8>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed starting from Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - No triangles can be formed starting from these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph: <0, 5, 8> and <5, 0, 8>.
