Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Node 0 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 8 or 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Node 1 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 3 or 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 doesn't have any edges, so no triangles can be formed with it. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Node 3 has a common 1-hop neighbor 5 with 7, forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Node 4 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 5 or 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 5 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 3 or 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Node 6 has a common 1-hop neighbor 4 with 9, forming a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 7 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 4 or 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Node 8 doesn't have any common 1-hop neighbors with either 9 or 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 only has connections with nodes smaller than itself, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
