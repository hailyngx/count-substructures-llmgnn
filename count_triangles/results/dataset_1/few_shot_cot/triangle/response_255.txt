Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 8 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 9 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, and <3, 4, 8>.
