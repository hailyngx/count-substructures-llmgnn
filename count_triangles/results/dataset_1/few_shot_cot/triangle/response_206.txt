Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there is no adjacent node greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip, as there is no adjacent node greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs involving nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs involving nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs involving nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
* Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, and the unique triangle found is <6, 7, 4>.
