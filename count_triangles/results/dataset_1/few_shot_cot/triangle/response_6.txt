Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbor sets:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Triangle: <4, 6, 9> (4, 6) and (4, 9) are connected, and (6, 9) is connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
* Final answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <4, 6, 9>.
