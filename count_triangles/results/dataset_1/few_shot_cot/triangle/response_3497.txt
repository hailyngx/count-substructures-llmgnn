Response:
Let's proceed with finding the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 2 are connected as (5, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
