Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left for forming triangles.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
