Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Node 2 does not have any 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 0). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Formed by <0, 4, 8>)

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
