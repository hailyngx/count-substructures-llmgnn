Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 14: (6, 8) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> Not considered as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2, also no nodes left to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 5, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough other nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles for the given graph:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>.
