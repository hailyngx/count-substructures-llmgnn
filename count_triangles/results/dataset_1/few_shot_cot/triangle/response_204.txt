Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
          
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1    
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
