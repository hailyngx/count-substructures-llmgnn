Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

  * Node 0:
      * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with 1 and 4 since they are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
      * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 1 and 9 since they are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
      * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 
      
  * Node 1:
      * Skip 1-hop neighbor 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
      * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 2 since they are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
      * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
      
  * Node 2:
      * Skip 1-hop neighbors 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
      * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Node 3:
      * Skip nodes smaller than 3.
      * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Node 4:
      * Skip 1-hop neighbors 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
      * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 7 since they are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
      * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
      
  * Node 5:
      * Skip nodes smaller than 5.
      * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Node 6:
      * Skip nodes smaller than 6.
      * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Node 7:
      * Skip 1-hop neighbors smaller than 7.
      * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Nodes 8 and 9:
      * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

  Summarizing the triangles:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.
  
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
