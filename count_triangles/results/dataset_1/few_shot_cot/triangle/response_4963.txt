1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it has a smaller node number.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4, and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
