Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
