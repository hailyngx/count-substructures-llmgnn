Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The pairs for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will be skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph: (<1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>).
