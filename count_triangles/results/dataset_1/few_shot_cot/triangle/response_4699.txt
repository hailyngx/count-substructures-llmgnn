Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the same process as shown in the example:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9**:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
