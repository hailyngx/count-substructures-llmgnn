Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the provided adjacency list and edge list to find the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

2. **Node 1**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: [0]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
