Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
