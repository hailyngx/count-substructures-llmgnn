Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   - Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1**:
   - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
   - Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
   - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
   - Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
   - Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [3].
