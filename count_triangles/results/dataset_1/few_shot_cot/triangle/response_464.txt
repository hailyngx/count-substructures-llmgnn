Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 as 6 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1 as it was already considered with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no direct edge between 3 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no direct edge between 3 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No edges connected to Node 7, so no triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
