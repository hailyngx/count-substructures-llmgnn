Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has only 1 neighbor (2), which is not enough to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, and 8:
    * Skipped as they either have only 1 neighbor or no pair of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair (7, 8) as Node 8 is smaller than 7.
    * Pair (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
