Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the graph as (7, 9). Checking for the shared 1-hop neighbor between 0, 7, and 9: Node 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of all three. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected in the graph as (4, 5). Checking for the shared 1-hop neighbor between 1, 4, and 5: No shared 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected in the graph as (6, 8). Checking for the shared 1-hop neighbor between 3, 6, and 8: No shared 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the graph as (7, 9). Checking for the shared 1-hop neighbor between 5, 7, and 9: Node 0 is a 1-hop neighbor of all three. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
