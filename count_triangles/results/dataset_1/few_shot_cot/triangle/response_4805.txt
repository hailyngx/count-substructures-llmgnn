Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 7 and 4 are also connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 5
[5] 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
