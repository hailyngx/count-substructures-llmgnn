Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
