Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
