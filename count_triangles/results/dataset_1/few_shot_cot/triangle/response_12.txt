Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as Node 6 has no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Not enough nodes to form triangles with since they only have 2 neighbors each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
