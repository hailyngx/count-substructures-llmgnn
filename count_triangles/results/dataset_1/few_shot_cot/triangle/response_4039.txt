Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no connections.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
