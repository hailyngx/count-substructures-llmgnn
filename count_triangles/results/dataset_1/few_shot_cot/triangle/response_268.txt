Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 1 since it is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 2 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are only connected through Node 1 and not directly adjacent. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs with 1-hop neighbors of 3 form a triangle. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 since they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes that can form triangles with Node 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 since they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 since they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 since they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 since they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes that can form triangles with Node 9. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
