1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 1 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
