Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all potential pairs since there are no nodes greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all potential pairs since there are no nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all potential pairs since there are no nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7:
    * Skip these nodes as they are smaller than 8 and there are no nodes left to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all potential pairs since there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 9>]
