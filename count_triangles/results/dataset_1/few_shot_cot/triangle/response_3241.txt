Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 3). No additional triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 3). No additional triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (3). No additional triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes (0, 2, 3). No additional triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipping all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes with greater numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
