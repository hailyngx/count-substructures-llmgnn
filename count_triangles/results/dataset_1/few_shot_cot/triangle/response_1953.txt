Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4, 5, 8, 9:
            * Since they do not have at least two nodes greater than them, there are no triangles involving them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
