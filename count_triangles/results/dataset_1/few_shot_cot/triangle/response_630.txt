Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 9>. 

So, the final answer is [4].
