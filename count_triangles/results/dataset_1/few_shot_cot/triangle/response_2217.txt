Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example given:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as (4, 6) is in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also connected as (5, 0) is in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are also connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 7.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are also connected as (9, 3) is in the edge list.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * No more pairs exist to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles: 
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
