1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the instructions provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <6, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
