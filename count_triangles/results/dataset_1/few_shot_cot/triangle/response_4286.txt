Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pair (0, 1) as 0 is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair (3, x) where x < 3.
    - No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    - Follow the same process of skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No triangles possible with Nodes 5, 6, or 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Skip pair (1, 8) as 1 is smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 5, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
