Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed including Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed including Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed including Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Cannot form a triangle as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to pair with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
