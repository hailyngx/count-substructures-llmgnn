Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) - Node 3, 8, and 1 form a triangle. <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all the nodes greater than 8 have been analyzed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph, which is <1, 3, 8>.
