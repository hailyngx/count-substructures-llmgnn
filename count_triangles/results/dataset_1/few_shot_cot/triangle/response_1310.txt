Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * The only node available for a pair is 1, but as 1 is smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0).
* Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <0, 2, 3>.
