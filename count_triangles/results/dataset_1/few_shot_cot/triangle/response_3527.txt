Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 9), but since they are both larger than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or Node 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since they are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 8), but since 2 is smaller, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
