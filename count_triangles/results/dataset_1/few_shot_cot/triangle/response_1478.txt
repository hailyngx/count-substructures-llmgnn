Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) > Node 0 and 3 are connected and both are 1-hop neighbors, forming a triangle <0, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) > Node 0, 4, and 7 are all connected to each other, forming a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) > No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) > No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) > No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9> and <0, 4, 7>.
