Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 3, or 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 3, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No 3-node triangle can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
