Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 0.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 2.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 4.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 5.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed using Node 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
