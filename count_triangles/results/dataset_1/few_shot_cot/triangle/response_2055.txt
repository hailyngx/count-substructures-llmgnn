Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip, as no pair of 1-hop neighbors exists to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there is only one 1-hop neighbor to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
