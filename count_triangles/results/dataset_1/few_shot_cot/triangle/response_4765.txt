Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
