Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
