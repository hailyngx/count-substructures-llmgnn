Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
