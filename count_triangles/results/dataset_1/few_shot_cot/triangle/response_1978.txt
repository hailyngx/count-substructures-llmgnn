Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor of 0 forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor of 1 forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pair to consider as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 5) and (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pair to consider as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pair to consider as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 9) and (9, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pair to consider as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pair to consider as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, which are <5, 7, 9> and <3, 5, 9>.
