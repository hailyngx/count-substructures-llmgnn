Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed as there are no 3 nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed as there are no 3 nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed as there are no 3 nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed as there are no 3 nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
