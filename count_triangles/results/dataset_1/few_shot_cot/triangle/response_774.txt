Response:
In this graph, to find the total number of triangles, we will examine each node and its 1-hop neighbors to identify the triangles they form. 

Let's start the process:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 
     
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4 

* Node 3: 
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (9, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * We will skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.
  
Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
