Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2) -> There are not enough 1-hop neighbors of 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9) -> There is a triangle formed with nodes 8, 9, and 4 <8, 9, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as Node 4 is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
