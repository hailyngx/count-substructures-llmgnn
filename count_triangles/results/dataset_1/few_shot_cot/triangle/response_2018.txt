Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with smaller nodes (0, 2, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with smaller nodes (4, 5, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Since they only have 2 or fewer neighbors, no triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
