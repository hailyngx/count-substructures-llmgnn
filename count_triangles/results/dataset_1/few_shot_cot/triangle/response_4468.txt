Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions with 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [2].
