Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
