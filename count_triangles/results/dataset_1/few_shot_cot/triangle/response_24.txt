Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as provided in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as (8, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skipping all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
