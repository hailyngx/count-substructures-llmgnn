Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 because it's smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 because they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
