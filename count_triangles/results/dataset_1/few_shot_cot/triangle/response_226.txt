Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 0 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 1 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 1 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 3, 8>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 3 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 7, 8>)

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
