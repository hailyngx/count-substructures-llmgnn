Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 0) and (0, 3) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 3) and (4, 0) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - Since there is only one neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node due to the constraints of the available nodes and edges.

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 4) and (4, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node due to the constraints of the available nodes and edges.

7. **Node 6**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node due to the constraints of the available nodes and edges.

8. **Node 7**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no neighbors.

9. **Node 8**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node due to the constraints of the available nodes and edges.

10. **Node 9**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node due to the constraints of the available nodes and edges.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
