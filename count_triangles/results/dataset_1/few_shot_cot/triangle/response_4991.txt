Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it's smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 3 since it's larger than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 4 are also directly connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) than 7.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
