Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <3, 4, 7>

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <4, 8, 9>

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4
* Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
* Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>.
