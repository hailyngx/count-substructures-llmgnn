Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the method described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * No other pairs for Node 1 to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
  * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 2, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed by Node 4 as it has no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other pairs for Node 5 to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
  * No other pairs for Node 6 to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
  * No other pairs for Node 8 to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed by Node 9 as it has no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
