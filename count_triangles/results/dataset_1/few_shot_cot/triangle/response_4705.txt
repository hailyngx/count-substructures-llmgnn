Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 0 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 1 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 2 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Triangle formed: (6, 7, 3) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 4 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 5 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 6 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 7 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 8 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 9 as there are no 3 unique neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
