Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 1, 4, 7, 8, 9) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
