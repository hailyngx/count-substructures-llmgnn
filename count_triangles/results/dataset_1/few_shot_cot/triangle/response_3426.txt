Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not form any triangles as there are no pairs of nodes greater than them combined.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
