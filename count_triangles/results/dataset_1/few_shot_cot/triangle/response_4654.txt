Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node as all its 1-hop neighbors are either not connected or already considered.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 

[<6, 7, 8>]
