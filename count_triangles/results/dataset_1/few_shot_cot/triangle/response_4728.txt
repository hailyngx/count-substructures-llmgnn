Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
