Response:
Following the example shown, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Node 7 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both Node 3 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both Node 5 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. 
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Nodes 8 and 9 are the only nodes left. No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
