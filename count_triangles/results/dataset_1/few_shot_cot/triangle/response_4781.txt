Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0: No triangles possible as Node 0 has no connections.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8: No triangles possible as Node 8 only has one connection.

* Node 9: No triangles possible as Node 9 only has one connection.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
