Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but 7 is not connected to 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 0 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 1 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
