Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same method used in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and connected.
    * No more pairs available for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and connected.
    * No more pairs available for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and connected.
    * No more pairs available for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 and connected.
    * No more pairs available for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 because they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 and connected.
    * No more pairs available for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there are no triangles that can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
