Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 since it's smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Node 9 has all triangles already counted with other nodes.
    * Skipped Node 8 as it's smaller than Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.
