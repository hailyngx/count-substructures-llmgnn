Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0)
* Final Answer: [2]

There are 2 triangles in the given graph, and they are <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 5>.
