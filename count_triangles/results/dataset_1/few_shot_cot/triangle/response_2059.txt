Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected as (8, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
