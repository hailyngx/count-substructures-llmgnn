Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both smaller than 2, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
