Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
