Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pairs with Node 0 and Node 1 are considered already.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pairs with Node 0 and Node 1 are considered already.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected as no edge (8, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 are considered already.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 are considered already.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
