Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0 and 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3. No edge between 0 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No edge between 3 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6 and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6. No edge between 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors for Node 7. No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
