Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the method from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipping all these nodes as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

If you want to display the unique triangles found, you can do so inside angular brackets <> like this: 
<0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>.
