Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's find all the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, and <3, 4, 9>.

So, the final answer is [4].
