Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Nodes 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
