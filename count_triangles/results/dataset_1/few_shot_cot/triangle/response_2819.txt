Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected. Possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: {3, 4, 6}.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Connected. Possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: {4, 5, 6}.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Connected. Possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: {2, 5, 6}.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected. Possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: {3, 4, 9}.

Summarizing the triangles found: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
[<3, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>]
