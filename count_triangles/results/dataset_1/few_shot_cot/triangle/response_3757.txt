Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No valid triangles can be formed as no two 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangles can be formed as no two 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
