Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
   - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
   - No more pairs available for Node 0.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, no triangle formed.
   - No more pairs available for Node 1.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 3.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
   - No more pairs available for Node 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <2, 4, 5>)

6. Node 5:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 6.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 7.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 8.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
   - No pairs available to consider for Node 9.
   - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
