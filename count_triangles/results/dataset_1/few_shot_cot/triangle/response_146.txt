Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
