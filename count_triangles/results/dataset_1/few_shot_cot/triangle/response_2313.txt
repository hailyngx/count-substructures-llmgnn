Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 4) in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 6 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 8 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
