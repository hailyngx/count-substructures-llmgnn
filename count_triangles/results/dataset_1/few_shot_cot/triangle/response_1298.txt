Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. 5 is not 1-hop neighbor of 4. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. 7 is 1-hop neighbor of 4. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * No triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as smaller numbered nodes.
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. 9 is 1-hop neighbor of 6. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No triangles with any larger numbered nodes.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles with Node 0 as it is smaller.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. 9 is 1-hop neighbor of 7. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles with Node 0 or 1 as smaller nodes.
  * No triangles with Node 2 as no larger nodes are left.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles with Node 4 as it is smaller.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles with smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
