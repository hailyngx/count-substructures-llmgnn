Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected as (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected as (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected as (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not connected as (9, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected as (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
