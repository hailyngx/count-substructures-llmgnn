Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
