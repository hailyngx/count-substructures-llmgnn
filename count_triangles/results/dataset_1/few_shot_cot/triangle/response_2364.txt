Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 0.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 0.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 1.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 1.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop connections with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* The process continues for Nodes 3, 4, and 5 similarly:
    * Node 3: 0 triangles
    * Node 4: <1, 7, 9>
    * Node 5: 0 triangles

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
