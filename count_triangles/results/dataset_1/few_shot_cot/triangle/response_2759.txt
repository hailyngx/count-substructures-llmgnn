Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0: Has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed with either Node 4 or Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * Unique triangles: <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 since it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <2, 3, 6>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <2, 3, 6>

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
