Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example provided, here is the step-by-step breakdown of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 as all its neighbors are already considered in previous steps.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 5 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Node 6 has already been considered in the count when examining the triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped as all their possible triangles have already been counted.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No additional triangles can be formed involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
