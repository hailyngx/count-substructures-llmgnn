Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs left to consider. No additional triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs available for Node 2 as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available for Node 3 as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to consider. No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs left to consider. No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available for Node 6 as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <7, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs left to consider. No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs left to consider. No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, and <7, 5, 8>.
