Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other possible triangles involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5 or 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other possible triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 3, 4>, <4, 8, 9>]
