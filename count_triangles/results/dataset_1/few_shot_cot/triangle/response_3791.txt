Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and Node 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Node 3 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Similar to Node 3, there are no pairs involving nodes greater than 4. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Node 0 and Node 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
