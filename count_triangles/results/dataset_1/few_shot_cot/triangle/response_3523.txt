Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 7.
    - Skip pairs (8, 9) and (3, 4) as they do not form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 9.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

[<3, 7, 5>, <7, 8, 4>, <3, 2, 6>]
