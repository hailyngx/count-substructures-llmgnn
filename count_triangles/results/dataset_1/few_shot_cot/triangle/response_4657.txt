1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 3) -> Node 0 and Node 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are directly connected, but Node 1 and Node 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are directly connected, but Node 1 and Node 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 3 are directly connected, and Node 1 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are directly connected, and Node 2 and Node 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are directly connected, and Node 2 and Node 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 4 are directly connected, but Node 2 and Node 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are directly connected, and Node 2 and Node 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are directly connected, but Node 2 and Node 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 6 are directly connected, but Node 2 and Node 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are directly connected, and Node 3 and Node 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are directly connected, and Node 3 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Node 3 and Node 5 are directly connected, and Node 3 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are directly connected, and Node 4 and Node 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
