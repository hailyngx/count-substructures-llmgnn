Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 16: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. They are both 1-hop neighbors of 8. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 17: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 18: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 19: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 20: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 5 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
