Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but (5, 6) is not in the edges list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and (5, 7) is in the edges list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and (6, 7) is in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and (5, 9) is in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and (9, 4) is in the edges list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but (6, 3) is not in the edges list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but (7, 9) is not in the edges list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
