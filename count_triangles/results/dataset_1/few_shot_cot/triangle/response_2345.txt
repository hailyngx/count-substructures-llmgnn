Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 6 and 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 7 as it is smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs are left to consider for Node 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No nodes greater than 8, so no triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 6 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
