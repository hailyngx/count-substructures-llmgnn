Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
