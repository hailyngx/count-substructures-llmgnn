Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * No pairs to consider as there are no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No other pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
