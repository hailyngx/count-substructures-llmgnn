Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
