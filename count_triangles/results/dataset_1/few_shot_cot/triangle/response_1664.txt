Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it has no connections to any other nodes.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there is only one connection to Node 7.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no connections to any other nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has no suitable pairs for triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected through (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has only two connections to Node 0 and Node 3, but they are not connected to each other.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only connections to Nodes 5 and 6 which don't form a triangle with each other.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has connections to Nodes 0 and 1 which don't form a triangle with each other.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
