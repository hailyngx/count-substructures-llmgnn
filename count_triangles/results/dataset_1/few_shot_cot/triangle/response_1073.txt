Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, thus no triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as per the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as per the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are connected as per the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, thus no triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. No new triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. No new triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
