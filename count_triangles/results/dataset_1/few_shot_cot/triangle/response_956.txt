Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Node 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <3, 4, 8> and <2, 3, 4>.
