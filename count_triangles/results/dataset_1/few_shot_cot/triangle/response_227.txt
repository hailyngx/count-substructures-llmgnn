Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the previous examples, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be considered with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skipped due to the absence of pairs greater than themselves.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9:
    * Skipped due to the absence of pairs greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the output is [3].
