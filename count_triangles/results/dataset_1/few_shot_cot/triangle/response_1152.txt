Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
It looks like we have <0, 3, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 4> as the unique triangles in the graph.
