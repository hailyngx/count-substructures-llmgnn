Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
