Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected. No third neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected. No third neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. No third neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected. No third neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. No third neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8 and Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
