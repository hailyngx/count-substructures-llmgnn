Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
