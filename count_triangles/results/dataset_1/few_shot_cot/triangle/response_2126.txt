Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are also connected as (4, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 5 are also connected as (7, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 6 are also connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 5 are also connected as (8, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are less than 2 nodes greater than 9 for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
