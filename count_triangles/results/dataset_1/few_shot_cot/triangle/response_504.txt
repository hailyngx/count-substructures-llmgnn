Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only possible pair is (5, 6), but both 5 and 6 are greater than 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * All skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
