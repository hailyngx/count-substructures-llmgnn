Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as it has no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
