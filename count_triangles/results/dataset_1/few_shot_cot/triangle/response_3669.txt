Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles: <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <3, 8, 9>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <7, 8, 9>)

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>]
