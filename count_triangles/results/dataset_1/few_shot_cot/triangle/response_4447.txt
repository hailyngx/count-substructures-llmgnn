Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 0 and 2.
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.
