Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no edge between 4 and 9 in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 5 (Node 8) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
