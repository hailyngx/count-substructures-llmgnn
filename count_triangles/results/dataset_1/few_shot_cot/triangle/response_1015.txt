Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed <3, 5, 9>.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed <6, 4, 9>.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip since there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph. [7]
