Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors exist for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors exist for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors exist for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors exist for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
