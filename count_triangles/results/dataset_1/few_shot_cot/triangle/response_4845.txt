Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, we will count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is an edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and there is an edge between them.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and there is an edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, 8 as they are 1-hop neighbors with edges between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Triangle formed with nodes 3, 8, 9 as they are 1-hop neighbors with edges between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
