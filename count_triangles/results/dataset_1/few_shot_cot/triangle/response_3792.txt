Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
