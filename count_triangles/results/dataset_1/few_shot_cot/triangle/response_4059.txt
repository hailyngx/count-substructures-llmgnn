Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same method used in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 7 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 7, and 9:
    * Skipped as they each have smaller nodes as 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 7 are connected as (7, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
