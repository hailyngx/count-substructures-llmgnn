Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 6, 9, and 0 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. 9, 0, and 6 form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. 9, 0, and 8 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the graph by summing up the triangles found for each node:
[2]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 6, 9> and <8, 9, 0>.
