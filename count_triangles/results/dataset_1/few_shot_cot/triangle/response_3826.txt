Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 5 are directly connected as (0, 2) and (5, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 3) and (9, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 7) and (9, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
