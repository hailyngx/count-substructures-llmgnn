Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles possible. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No pairs possible with nodes greater than 2. Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, but self-loop not allowed. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    No possible triangles as there are no combinations of 3 nodes available.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
