Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - No additional triangles can be formed since there is only one edge connecting 2 to 0 and 1 which is insufficient to form a triangle.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - No additional triangles can be formed since there is only one edge connecting 4 to 1 and 7 which is insufficient to form a triangle.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5 to 9:
  - Skipped as there aren't enough connected nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
