Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0, as it's smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skipped as it does not have any neighbors to form triangles with. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Skip any other pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
