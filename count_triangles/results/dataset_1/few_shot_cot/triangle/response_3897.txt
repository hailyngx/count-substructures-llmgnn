Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller nodes, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
