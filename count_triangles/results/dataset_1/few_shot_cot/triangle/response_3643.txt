Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
