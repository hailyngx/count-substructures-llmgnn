Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8 as they have been covered in other iterations.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
