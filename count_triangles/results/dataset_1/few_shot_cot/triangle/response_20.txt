Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected (2, 1) and (6, 1). Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 3-node paths.

* Node 4:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected (6, 4) and (8, 4). Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 3-node paths.

* Node 6:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected (8, 6) and (9, 6). Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 3-node paths.

* Node 8:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
