Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't any pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
