Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No triangle formed since 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed since 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed since 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed since 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed since 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - No triangle formed since 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) - No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Similar to above, no triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
