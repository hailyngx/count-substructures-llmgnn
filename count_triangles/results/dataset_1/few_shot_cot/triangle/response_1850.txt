Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
   - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangle formed with Node 2.

4. **Node 3:**
   - No neighbors for Node 3 to form triangles. No triangle formed with Node 3.

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangle formed with Node 4.

6. **Node 5:**
   - No pairs available to form triangles with Node 5. No triangle formed.

7. **Node 6:**
   - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. **Node 7:**
   - Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
   - No pairs available to form triangles with Node 8. No triangle formed.

10. **Node 9:**
    - No pairs available to form triangles with Node 9. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles formed:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <0, 7, 9>.
