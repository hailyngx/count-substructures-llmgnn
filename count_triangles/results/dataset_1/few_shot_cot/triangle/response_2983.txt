Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 3, 4, 5: Because there are nodes smaller than 3, 4, and 5 that are 1-hop neighbors of these nodes, we will skip them.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * We skip nodes 8 and 9 as well due to having only one neighbor each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 1>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 5>.
