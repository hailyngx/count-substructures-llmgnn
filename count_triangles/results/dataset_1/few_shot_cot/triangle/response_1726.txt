Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.
