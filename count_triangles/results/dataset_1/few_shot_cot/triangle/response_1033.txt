Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with 1 as the smallest node. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with 3 as the smallest node. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with 5 as the smallest node. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with 7 as the smallest node. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with 9 as the smallest node. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>]
