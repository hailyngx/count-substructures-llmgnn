Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are less than 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 8), but since 4 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
