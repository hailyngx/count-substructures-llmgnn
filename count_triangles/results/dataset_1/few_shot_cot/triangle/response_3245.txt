Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 since they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 since they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 9), but since 3 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes that are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
