Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, we will now count the triangles for each node:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    - Unique triangles: <3, 6, 8>

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles: <8, 9, 6>

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
