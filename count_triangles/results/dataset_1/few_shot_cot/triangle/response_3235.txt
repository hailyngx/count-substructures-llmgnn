Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
