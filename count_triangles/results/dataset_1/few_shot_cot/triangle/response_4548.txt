Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 9), but since 1 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 6>]
