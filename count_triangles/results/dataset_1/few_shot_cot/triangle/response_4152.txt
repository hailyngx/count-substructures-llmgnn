Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example, we will now compute the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> No triangle formed as it is a self-loop.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
