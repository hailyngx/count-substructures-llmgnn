Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4, as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to insufficient nodes to form triangles (need at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9).

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
