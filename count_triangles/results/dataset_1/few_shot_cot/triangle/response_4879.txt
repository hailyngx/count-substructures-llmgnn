Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

\[<1, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <7, 7, 8>\]
