Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Thus, there are 10 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
