Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle <1, 4, 7>.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle <2, 5, 9>.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
