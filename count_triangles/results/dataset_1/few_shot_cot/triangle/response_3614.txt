Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}
