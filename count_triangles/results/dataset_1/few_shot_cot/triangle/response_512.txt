Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it only has 1 neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as two of its neighbors need an edge between them to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

5. Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it needs more neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it needs more neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it only has 1 neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it needs more neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it needs more neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
