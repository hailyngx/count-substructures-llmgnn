Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor (9) and they are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor (3) and they are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
