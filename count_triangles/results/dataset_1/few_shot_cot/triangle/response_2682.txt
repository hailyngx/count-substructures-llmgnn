Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only one node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pair with larger nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
    * Similar to NODE 4, there are no triangles involving these nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No pair with larger nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
