Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skipped as there are no edges connected to Node 2.

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected by the edge (4, 6).
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected by the edge (4, 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected by the edge (5, 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (8, 7), but since 8 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skipped as there are no edges connected to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
