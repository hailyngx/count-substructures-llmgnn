Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}
