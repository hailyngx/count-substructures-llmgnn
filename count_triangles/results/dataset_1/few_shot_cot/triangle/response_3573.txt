1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more possible triangles with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more possible triangles with node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more possible triangles with node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No more possible triangles with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
