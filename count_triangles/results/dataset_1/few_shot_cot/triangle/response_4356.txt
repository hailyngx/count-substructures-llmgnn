Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the process explained in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Only 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Only 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Only 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbor of Node 6 is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as the 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered for forming triangles, as there is only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
