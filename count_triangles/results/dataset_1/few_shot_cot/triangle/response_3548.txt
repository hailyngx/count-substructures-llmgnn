Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle can be formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
