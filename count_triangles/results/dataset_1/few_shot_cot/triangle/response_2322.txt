Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs containing Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs containing Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
