Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
