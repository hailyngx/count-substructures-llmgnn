Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No further pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    - No further pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5.
    - No further pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 6.
    - No further pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
