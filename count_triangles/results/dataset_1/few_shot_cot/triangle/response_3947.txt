Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge (1, 2) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected. There is also a direct edge between Node 0 and Node 1. A triangle is formed: <0, 1, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Node 3 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. There is also a direct edge between Node 1 and Node 3. A triangle is formed: <1, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles are formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. There is also a direct edge between Node 3 and Node 4. A triangle is formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. There is also a direct edge between Node 3 and Node 4. A triangle is formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles are formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list.
    * No other pairs are possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangles are formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are connected. There is also a direct edge between Node 9 and Node 1. A triangle is formed: <1, 7, 9>.
    * No other pairs are possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
