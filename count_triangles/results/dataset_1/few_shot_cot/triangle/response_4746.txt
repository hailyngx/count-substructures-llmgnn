Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip this node as it is smaller than Node 4 and there are no larger nodes connected to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
