Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected by edge (5, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected by edge (2, 3).
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected by edge (3, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 4. No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
