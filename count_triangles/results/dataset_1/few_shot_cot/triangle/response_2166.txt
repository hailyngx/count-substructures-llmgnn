Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
