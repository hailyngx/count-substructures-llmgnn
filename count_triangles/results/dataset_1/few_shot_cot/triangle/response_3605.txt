Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, as they are greater than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, as they are greater than 1.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, as they are greater than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it's greater than 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it's greater than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7 as they are greater than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Let's continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are greater than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it's greater than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it's greater than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * No other nodes to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
