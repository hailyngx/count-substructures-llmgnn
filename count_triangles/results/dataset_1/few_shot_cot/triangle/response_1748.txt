Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs containing node 0, as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, no triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangle possible, as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
