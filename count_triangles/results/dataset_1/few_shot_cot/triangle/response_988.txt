Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
