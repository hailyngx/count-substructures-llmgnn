Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, I will now count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Finally, calculating the total number of triangles in the given graph:  
Total triangles = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
