Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6, 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2, 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and connected. Forms a triangle with Node 6: <1, 2, 6>
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7, 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <4, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 4), but since 5 and 4 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
