Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Nodes 0 and 1 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
