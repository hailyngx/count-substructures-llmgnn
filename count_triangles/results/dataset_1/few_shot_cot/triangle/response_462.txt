Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected because (2, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as 4 is the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) - This is a self-loop on node 9 and cannot form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
