Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
