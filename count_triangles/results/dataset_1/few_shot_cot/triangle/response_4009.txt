Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, but 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, but 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with lower numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, but 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, but 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with lower numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with lower numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, and 8:
    * No edges connected to these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with lower numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
