Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each one to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
