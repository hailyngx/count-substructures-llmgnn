Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method used in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed with (1, 3) as there is no edge between 1 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed with (1, 6) as there is no edge between 1 and 6.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed with (1, 8) as there is no edge between 1 and 8.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed with (3, 6) as there is no edge between 3 and 6.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed with (3, 8) as there is no edge between 3 and 8.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed with (6, 8) as there is no edge between 6 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed with (1, 6) as there is no edge between 1 and 6.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed with (1, 9) as there is no edge between 1 and 9.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed with (5, 6) as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed with (5, 9) as there is no edge between 5 and 9.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed with (6, 9) as there is no edge between 6 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed with (5, 6) as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed with (5, 6) as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
