Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as mentioned in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because no other nodes are greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
