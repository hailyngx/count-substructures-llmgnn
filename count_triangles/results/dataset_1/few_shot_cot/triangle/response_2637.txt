Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 8), but since 4 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
