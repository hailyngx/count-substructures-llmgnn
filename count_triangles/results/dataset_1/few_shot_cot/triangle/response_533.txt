Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected, forming a triangle. Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
  - No more pairs can be formed with Node 0.

- Node 1:
  - No pairs can be formed with Node 1.

- Node 2:
  - No pairs can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
  - Only 1 triangle was found with Node 0.

- Node 4:
  - No pairs can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
  - No pairs can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
  - No triangles found.

- Node 7:
  - No triangles found.

- Node 8:
  - No triangles found.

- Node 9:
  - No pairs can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
