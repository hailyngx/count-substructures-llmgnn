Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Node 2 and 4 are connected (2, 4) and 4 is 1-hop neighbor of 3, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Node 6 and 7 are connected and 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as Node 5 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) - Node 8 and 4 are connected and 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
