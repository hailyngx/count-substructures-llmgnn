Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
