Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5> 
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 6), but since 0 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
