Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 3
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    * No more valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Nodes 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
