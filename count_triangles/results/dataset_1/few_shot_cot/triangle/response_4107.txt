Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs with 0 in them due to their lower node number.
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 due to lower node numbers.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 3:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
            * No new triangles can be formed with the remaining pairs.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
            * No new triangles can be formed with the remaining pairs.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7, 8, 9: 
            * Skipped as they don't have pairs with nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 9.

        Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
