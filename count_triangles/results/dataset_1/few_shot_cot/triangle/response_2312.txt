Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs larger than 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 4, or 5 since they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, or 5 since they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 3, or 5 since they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
