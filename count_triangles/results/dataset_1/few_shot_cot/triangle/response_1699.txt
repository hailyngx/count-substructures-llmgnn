Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because 8 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
[<7, 9, 8>, <9, 7, 5>, <8, 9, 7>, <5, 7, 9>]
