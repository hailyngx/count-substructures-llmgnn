Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example along with the provided graph: 

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as both 2 and 3 are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has only 2 as a 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as both 5 and 9 are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as both 4 and 9 are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as both 2 and 7 are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as both 6 and 9 are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected despite being 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected despite being 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
