Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4: 
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: 
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
