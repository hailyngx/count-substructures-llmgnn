Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided and calculating the number of triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed as nodes 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed as nodes 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed as nodes 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - No triangle formed as nodes 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) - No triangle formed as nodes 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) - No triangle formed as nodes 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) - No triangle formed as nodes 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) - No triangle formed as nodes 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as nodes 3 and 7 are connected but not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle formation as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed with nodes 2, 3, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, and 7.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Triangle formed with nodes 3, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as nodes 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as nodes 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No triangle formed as nodes 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle formation since there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle formation since there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
