Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as Node 8 is not a neighbor of Node 4.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has only one neighbor (Node 8), there are no triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not a neighbor of Node 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not a neighbor of Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as Node 9 is not a neighbor of Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed as Node 0 is not a neighbor of Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5 and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
