Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach used in the previous example to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles possible as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as the missing vertex: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as the missing vertex: <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as the missing vertex: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the missing vertex: <1, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7: No triangles possible as Node 7 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8: No triangles possible as Node 8 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
