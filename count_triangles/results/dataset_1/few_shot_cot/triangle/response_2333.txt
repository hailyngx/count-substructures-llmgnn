Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No more pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 6 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No more pairs to consider as Node 7 has only one pair that forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No more pairs to consider as Node 9 has only one pair that forms a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
