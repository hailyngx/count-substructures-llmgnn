Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 9>]
