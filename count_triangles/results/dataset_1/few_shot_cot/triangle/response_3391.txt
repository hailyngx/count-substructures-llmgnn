Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not connected because (7, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes that are smaller (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes that are smaller (0, 1, and 2).
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 7:
    * Skipped because they have no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 1 are connected as (8, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 1, 8>]
