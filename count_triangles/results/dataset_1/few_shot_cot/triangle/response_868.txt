Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
