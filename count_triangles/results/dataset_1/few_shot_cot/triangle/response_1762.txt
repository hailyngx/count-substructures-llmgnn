Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as (2, 3) edge is missing.
  - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as (2, 8) edge is missing.
  - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as (3, 8) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - No possible triangles as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as (4, 6) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as (6, 8) edge is missing.
  - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as (6, 9) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed as (1, 8) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - No possible triangles as it has no neighbors.

* Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (3, 0) -> Triangle formed with nodes (3, 0, 6) since they are all connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  - No possible triangles as there are only two neighbors.

* Node 8:
  - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Triangle formed with nodes (0, 3, 8) since they are all connected.
  - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed as (0, 4) edge is missing.
  - Pair 3: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as (0, 7) edge is missing.
  - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as (3, 4) edge is missing.
  - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as (3, 7) edge is missing.
  - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as (4, 7) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
  - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed as (7, 3) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
