Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> Both 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
