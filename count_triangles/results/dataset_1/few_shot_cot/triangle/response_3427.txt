Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair to consider is (3, 9) but it cannot form a triangle. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with nodes 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
