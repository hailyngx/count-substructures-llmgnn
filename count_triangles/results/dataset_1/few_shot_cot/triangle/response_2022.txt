Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6}

Response:
Let's start counting the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 5), but since 4 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
