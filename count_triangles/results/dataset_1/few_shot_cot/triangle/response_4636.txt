Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example above, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
