Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No possible pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No possible pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No possible pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No possible pairs for forming triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
