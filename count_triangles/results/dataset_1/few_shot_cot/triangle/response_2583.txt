Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 1 and 4.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 1 and 5.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 1 and 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 4 and 5.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 4 and 6.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 4 and 8.
    - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 4 and 9.
    - Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 5 and 6.
    - Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 5 and 8.
    - Pair 7: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 5 and 9.
    - Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 6 and 8.
    - Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 6 and 9.
    - Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Not a triangle because no additional node is connected to both 8 and 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped because they do not have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
