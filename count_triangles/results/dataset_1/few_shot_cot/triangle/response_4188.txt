Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected per the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pair to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pair to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
