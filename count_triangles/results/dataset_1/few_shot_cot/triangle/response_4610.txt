Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 as there is no edge (9, 4) shown in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
