Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with only Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with only Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with only Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with only Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
