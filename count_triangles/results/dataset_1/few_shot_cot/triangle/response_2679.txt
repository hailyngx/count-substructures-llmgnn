Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles for Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 0), but since 7 is smaller than 0, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles for Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles for Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 3), but since 3 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
