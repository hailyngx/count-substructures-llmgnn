Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs due to being smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs due to being smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * The only pair is (6, 6) which is not valid, so no triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs due to being smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs due to being smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <0, 6, 7>.
