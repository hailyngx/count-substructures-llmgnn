Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles for Node 1: <1, 2, 5>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles for Node 2: <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 6>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 3: <3, 4, 9>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 4: <4, 5, 6>

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 6.
* Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
* The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 2, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>.
