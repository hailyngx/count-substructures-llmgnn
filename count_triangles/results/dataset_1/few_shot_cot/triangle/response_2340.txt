Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 5 are also connected as (6, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
