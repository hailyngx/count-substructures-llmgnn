Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles as there are no connected pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No new triangles as all possible triangles including Node 5 as the smallest numbered node have already been counted.

- Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    - No possible triangles with these nodes individually.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
