Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
