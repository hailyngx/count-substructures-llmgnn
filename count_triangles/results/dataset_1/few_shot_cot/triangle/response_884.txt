Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the steps described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs found for Node 2. No triangle formed.

- Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs found for Node 3. No triangle formed.

- Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 6 to 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
