Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 0.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed using Node 1.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected by edge (3, 7).
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 3, 7>

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected by edge (4, 8).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles involving Node 7: <4, 7, 8>

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 3, 7>, <4, 7, 8>]
