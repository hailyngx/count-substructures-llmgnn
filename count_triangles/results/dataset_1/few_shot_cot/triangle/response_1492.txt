Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
