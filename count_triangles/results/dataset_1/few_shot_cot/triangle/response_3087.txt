Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs involving node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
