Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the first example, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Both 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 5 only has Node 0 as a 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 6 has no 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Both 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 9 has only Node 2 as a 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
