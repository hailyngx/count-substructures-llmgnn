Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no connections.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it only has one neighbor.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not connected because (0, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not connected because (0, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not connected because (0, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 9 are also connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it only has one neighbor.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
