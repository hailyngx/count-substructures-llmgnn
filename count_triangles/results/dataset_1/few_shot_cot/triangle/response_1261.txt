Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or smaller nodes as they are already covered.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is a smaller node.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
