Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
