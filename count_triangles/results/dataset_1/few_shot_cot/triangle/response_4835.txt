Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Response:
Following the example provided, let's go through each node to count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) <0, 1, 2> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) <0, 1, 4> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) <0, 4, 7> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Node 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) <1, 2, 9> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Node 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) <2, 4, 9> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) <4, 6, 9> -> Forms a triangle as all nodes are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Node 9 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
