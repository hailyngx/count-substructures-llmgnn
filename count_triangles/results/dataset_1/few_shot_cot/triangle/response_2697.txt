Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 as they are smaller than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 7 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs since there are no nodes greater than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * No pairs to consider since 6 has no 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * No pairs to consider since 9 only has 1-hop neighbors 1 and 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

        So, the final answer is [5].
