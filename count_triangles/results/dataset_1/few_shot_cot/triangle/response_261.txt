Response:
Following the method described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with a node smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with a node smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5: No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7 and 8: No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 

[<1, 2, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <6, 5, 9>, <9, 6, 7>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 1, 2>]
