Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Proceeding with the process to find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip as no 2-hop neighbor exists.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as no 2-hop neighbor exists.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip as no 2-hop neighbor exists.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip as no 2-hop neighbor exists.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as no 2-hop neighbor exists.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
