Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 8 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 0 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to form a triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs to form a triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
