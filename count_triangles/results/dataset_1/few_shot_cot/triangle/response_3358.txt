Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the same method as explained earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (8, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 7 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
