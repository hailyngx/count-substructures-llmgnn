1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 1) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * There are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * There are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
