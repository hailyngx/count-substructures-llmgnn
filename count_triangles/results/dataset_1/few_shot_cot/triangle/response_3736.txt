Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
