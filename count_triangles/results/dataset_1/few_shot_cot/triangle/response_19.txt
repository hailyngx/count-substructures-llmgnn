Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
