Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>
