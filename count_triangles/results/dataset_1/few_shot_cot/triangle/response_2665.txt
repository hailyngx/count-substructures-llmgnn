Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Final answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
