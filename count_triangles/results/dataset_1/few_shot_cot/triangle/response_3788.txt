Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0: Skipped since it has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No potential triangle as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) → 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No potential triangle as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) → 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No potential triangle as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * No potential triangle as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 7: Skipped since it has no neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No potential triangle as there is only one neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
