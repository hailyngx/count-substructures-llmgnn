Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for counting triangles in the graph, we go through each node to identify the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
