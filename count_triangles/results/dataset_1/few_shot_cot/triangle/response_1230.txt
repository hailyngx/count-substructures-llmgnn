Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as demonstrated in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] as shown in the triangles below:
<0, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 4>.
