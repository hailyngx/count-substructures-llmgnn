Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 does not have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3 as a part of it.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
