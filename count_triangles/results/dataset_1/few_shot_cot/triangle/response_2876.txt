Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed as 1 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 5, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed with nodes 7, 5, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed as 9 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
