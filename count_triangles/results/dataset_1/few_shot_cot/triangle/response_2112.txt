Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed by Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed by Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3)
* Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
