Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
