Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as it has no 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Both 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected (8, 0). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 3, 6>, <6, 7, 3>, <7, 0, 8>]
