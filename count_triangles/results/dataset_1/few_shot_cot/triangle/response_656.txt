Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected.  
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 5. No other nodes to consider. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are all smaller than 6. There are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 as they are all smaller than 8. There are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are all smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
