Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1. They are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3. They are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the graph as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. They are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected in the graph as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3. They are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the graph as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
