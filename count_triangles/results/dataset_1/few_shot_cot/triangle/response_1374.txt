Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are all smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are all smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Cannot form triangles as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
