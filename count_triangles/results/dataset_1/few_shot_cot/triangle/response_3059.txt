Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
   - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
   - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
   - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
   - Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
   - No other nodes left to form triangles.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
   - No other nodes left to form triangles.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
   - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
   - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected in the graph.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
   - No other nodes left to form triangles.
   - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
