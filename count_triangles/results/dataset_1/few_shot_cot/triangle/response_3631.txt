Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) - No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) - No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) - No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 since it only has one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 that haven't been already covered with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
