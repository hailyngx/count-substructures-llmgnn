Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        - Skip, no pair to consider.
        - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        - No 1-hop neighbors to form a pair. Skip.
        - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
        - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
        - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (6).
        - No other nodes left to form triangles.
        - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (4, 5).
        - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 4).
        - No other nodes left to form triangles.
        - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        - Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
