Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Node 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 5 is connected to 0 as (5, 0).
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
