Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs (2, 3) as they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Skip pair (2, 7) as both are in the same 1-hop neighborhood.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 4. No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible as there are no other nodes in the graph to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
