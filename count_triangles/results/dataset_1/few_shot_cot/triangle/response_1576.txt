Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * As before, we will skip any pair that includes Node 0 or Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 9.
    * No further triangles can be made with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0)
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
