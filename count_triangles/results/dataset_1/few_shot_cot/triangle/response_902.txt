Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 8).
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 0) and (0, 7).
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 0) and (0, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has only one 1-hop neighbor, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0, as it has a smaller number. 
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as 0 is smaller than 3. No other pairs left to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has only one 1-hop neighbor, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0, as it has a smaller number.
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 5 as it is smaller. No other pairs left to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as 0 is smaller than 7. No other pairs left to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller numbers. No other pairs left to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 4, or 8 as they are all smaller numbers. No other pairs left to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
