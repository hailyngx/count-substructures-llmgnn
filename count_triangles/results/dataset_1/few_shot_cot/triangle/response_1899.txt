Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they don't share an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs as all nodes connected to 2 are smaller in number. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Same reasoning as node 1, all unique triangles are already counted. No additional triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as all nodes connected to 5 are smaller in number. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as all nodes connected to 6 are smaller in number. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as all nodes connected to 9 are smaller in number. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
