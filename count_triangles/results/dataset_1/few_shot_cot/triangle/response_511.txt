Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, I will count the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node's 1-hop neighbors:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 2 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0, or 1, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 4 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 5 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 6 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 8 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles are possible with Node 9 as the smallest node due to a lack of additional nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
