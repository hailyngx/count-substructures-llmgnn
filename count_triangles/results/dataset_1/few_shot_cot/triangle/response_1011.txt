Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Node 0 has a 1-hop neighbor 1 and 8. They are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Node 0 has 1 and 9 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Nodes 1 has 3 and 4 as 1-hop neighbors which are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 2 has 4 and 5 as 1-hop neighbors which are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 3 has 5 and 6 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Node 4 has 8 and 5 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> Nodes 5 has 6 and 3 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Nodes 5 has 8 and 9 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangle formed for Node 6 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle formed for Node 7 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Node 8 has 9 and 0 as 1-hop neighbors which are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed for Node 9 as it has only 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
