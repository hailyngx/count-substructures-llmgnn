Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 is disconnected from the rest of the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
