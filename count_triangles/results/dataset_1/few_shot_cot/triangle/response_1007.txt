Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the graph with the given information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 and 9 as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
