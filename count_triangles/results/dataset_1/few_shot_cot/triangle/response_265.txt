Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
