Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 2), but since 1 and 2 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
