Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or Node 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 9>.
