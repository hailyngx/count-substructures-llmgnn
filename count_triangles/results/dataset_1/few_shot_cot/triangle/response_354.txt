Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors for Node 7, hence no triangles formable.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles are:  
<2, 3, 9>  
<3, 5, 4>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<0, 2, 5>

So, the final answer is [4].
