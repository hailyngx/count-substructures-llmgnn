Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 11: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 12: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 13: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 14: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 15: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6:
    - Since all the other nodes have smaller node numbers compared to Node 9, they won't form triangles with 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 1)
- Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
