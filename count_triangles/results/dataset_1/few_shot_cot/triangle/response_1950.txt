Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 0 since it's smaller than 4.
    * Skip Nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has only 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
