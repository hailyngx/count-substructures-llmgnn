Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs for Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs for Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs for Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs for Node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No other pairs for Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs for Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pairs to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
