Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
