Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided for the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - No neighbors to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
  - No other pairs left to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - No pairs to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - No pairs to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - No pairs to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
