Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes as all neighbors are unique.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
