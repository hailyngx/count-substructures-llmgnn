Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
