Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
