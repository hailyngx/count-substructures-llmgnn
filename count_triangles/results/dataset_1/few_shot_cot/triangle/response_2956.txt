Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no nodes greater than Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 0 is the only node smaller than Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 are all smaller than Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is [0].
