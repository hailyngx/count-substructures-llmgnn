Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 7 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 8 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 9 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 5 are not connected (no edge between them).
    * No other triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
