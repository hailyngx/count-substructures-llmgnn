Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Since there are no other nodes greater than 1 that are connected to both 4 and 8, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Since there is no other node greater than 2 that is connected to both 7 and 8, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected. Since there is no other node greater than 4 that is connected to both 8 and 6, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected. Since there is no other node greater than 6 that is connected to both 8 and 7, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected. Since there is no other node greater than 7 that is connected to both 8 and 6, no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs remain to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
