Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * We already considered all possible pairs with Node 0 which is smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Since there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes, we skip each of them.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
