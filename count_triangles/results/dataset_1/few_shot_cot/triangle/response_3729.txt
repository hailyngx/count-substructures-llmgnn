Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
[7]

Triangles: <0, 5, 6> <0, 6, 8> <4, 5, 6> <5, 6, 7> <5, 6, 9>
