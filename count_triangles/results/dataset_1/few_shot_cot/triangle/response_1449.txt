Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
