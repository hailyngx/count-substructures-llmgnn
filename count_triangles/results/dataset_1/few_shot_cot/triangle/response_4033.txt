Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Skipped as 5 and 7 are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Skipped as 2 is a smaller node.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (6, 3) -> Skipped as both neighbors are smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Repeated pair, already counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
