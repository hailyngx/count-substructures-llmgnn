This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
