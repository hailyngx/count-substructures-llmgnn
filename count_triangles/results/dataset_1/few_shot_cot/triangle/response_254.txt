Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    Skipping Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    Skipping Pair 1 as it includes Node 1 which is smaller.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    Skipping Node 5 as there are no 1-hop neighbors left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    Skipping Node 8 as there are no 1-hop neighbors left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    Skipping Node 9 as there are no 1-hop neighbors left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
