Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are also directly connected. One side of the triangle found. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are also directly connected. Another side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Another side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Another side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Final side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 and 7:
    * Skipped as there are no edges connected to these nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs including nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
