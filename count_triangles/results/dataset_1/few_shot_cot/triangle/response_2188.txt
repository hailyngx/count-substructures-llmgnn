Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No edge between 4 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No edge between 4 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No edge between 4 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No edge between 5 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No edge between 6 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No edge between 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair left is (0, 7), but since 0 is smaller than 7, this pair is ignored.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * Similar to above, no triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    * The only pair left is (8, 9) but no edge exists between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles from each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output of the final answer should be [0].
