Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
