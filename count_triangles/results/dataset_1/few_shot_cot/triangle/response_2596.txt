Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

  * Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 3:
    * Since there are no other nodes greater than 3, there can be no triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 5:
    * Since there are no other nodes greater than 5, there can be no triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 7:
    * Since there are no other nodes greater than 7, there can be no triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [3].
