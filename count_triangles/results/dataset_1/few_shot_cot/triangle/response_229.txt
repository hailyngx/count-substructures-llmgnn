Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes can form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes can form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
