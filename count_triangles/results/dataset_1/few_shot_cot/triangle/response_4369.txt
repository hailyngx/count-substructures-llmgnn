Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (0, 2) and (0, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (8, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.
[<0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <5, 8, 9>]
