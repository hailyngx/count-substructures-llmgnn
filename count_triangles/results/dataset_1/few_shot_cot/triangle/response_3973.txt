Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * The only possibility is (2, 8), and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1. They are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2. They are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. They are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are directly connected and form a triangle with 6.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
