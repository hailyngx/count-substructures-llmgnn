Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as before:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 6: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 7: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 8: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 9: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 10: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 11: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 12: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Continuing to form a triangle with Node 0.
  - Pair 13: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 14: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 1:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0)
- Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
