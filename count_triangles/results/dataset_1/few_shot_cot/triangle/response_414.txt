Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * There are no pairs to consider for Node 2 as all other nodes are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
