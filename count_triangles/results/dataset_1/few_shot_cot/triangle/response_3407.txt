Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 9>]
