Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 2) -> Skipped because it is a self-loop and not counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> Skipped because it is a self-loop and not counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> Skipped because it is a self-loop and not counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 8), but since 8 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
