Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are connected.
    - Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Nodes 2 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Triangles: <0, 1, 8>

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 5:
    - No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Triangles: None

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Triangles: None

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1
- Triangles: <0, 1, 8>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
