Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected because (1, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with a larger node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with a larger node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with a larger node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with a larger node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with a larger node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 6) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
