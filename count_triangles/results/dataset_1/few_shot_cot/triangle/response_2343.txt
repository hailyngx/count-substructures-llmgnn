Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the graph as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1)
Thus, the final answer is [1].

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
