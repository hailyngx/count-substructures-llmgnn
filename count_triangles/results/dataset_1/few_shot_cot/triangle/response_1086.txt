Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No valid triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 4, 7 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles starting with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles starting with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid triangles starting with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
