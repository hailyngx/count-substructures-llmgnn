Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  - No need to calculate as Node 4 is smaller than all other nodes.

* Node 5:
  - No need to calculate as Node 5 is smaller than all other nodes.

* Node 6:
  - No need to calculate as Node 6 is smaller than all other nodes.

* Node 7:
  - No need to calculate as Node 7 is smaller than all other nodes.

* Node 8 and 9:
  - Not enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [0].
