Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs that can form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs that can form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs that can form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
