Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no triangles with 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
