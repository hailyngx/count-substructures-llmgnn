Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
  No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

- Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

- Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and are connected. Triangle formed.
  Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
  No triangles can be formed as Node 9 has only one 1-hop neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
