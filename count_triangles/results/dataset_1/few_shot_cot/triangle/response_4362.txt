Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided earlier, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 6). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 8). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider since there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
