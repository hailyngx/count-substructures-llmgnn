Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example:

1. Node 0:  
   * Pair 1: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
   * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
   * No pair to consider for triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. 
   * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
   * No pair to consider for triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   * No pair to consider for triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
   * No pair to consider for triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
   * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
   * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are:  
<1, 2, 7>  
<4, 5, 8>
