Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Connected, triangle <0, 2, 9> formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected, triangle <2, 4, 9> formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Connected, triangle <2, 6, 9> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:  
*[1 (Node 0), 2 (Node 2)]   
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  
[<0, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>]
