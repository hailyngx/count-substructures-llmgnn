Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip other nodes as they have a smaller number than Node 3. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip other nodes as they have a smaller number than Node 5. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
