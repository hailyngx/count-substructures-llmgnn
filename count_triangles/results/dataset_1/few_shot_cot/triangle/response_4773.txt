Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed since there are no other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1 since they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed since there are no other nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 since they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 since they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed since there are no other nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 since they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 0, 7>.
