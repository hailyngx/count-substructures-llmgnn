Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
