Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for triangles as there is no neighbor greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles to form from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles to form from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles to form from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles to form from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
