Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles with these nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5, Node 6, Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5, 6, 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
