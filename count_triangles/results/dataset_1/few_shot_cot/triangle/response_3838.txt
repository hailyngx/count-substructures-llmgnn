Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle for Node 1 as there are no two nodes greater than Node 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No edges between 4 and 7, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No possible triangle for Node 4 as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 4 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No possible triangle for Node 5 as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 5 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle for Node 8 as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No possible triangle for Node 9 as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
