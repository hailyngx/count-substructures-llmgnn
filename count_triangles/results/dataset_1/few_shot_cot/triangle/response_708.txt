Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the provided instructions and step-by-step process, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there aren't two nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there aren't two nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
