Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Since Node 3 has only one 1-hop neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
