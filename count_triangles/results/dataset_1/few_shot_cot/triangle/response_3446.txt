Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the counting triangles method used in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 that are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1 that are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 that are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 that are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 that are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 that are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
