Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example before, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 5 are possible.
  
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 8 are possible.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 9 are possible.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3 triangles] in the given graph.
