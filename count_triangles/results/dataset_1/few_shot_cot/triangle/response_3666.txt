Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) and (4, 1) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) and (7, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) and (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) and (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) and (7, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
