Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and are also connected. Triangle formed: <5, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and are also connected. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.
