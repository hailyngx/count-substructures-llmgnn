Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each one.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
