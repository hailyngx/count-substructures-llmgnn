Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Triangle formed as 3, 4, and 9 are all connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 9>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Triangle formed as 4, 5, and 9 are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 5, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
