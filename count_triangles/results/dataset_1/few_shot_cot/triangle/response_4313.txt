Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to consider as there are no triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 3, 7> and <0, 7, 9>.
