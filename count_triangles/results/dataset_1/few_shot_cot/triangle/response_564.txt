Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all nodes as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all nodes as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
