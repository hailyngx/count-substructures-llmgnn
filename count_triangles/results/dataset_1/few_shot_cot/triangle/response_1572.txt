Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No pairs available for forming triangles with Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No pairs available for forming triangles with Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
