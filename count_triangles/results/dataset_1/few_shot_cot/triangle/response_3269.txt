Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Node 2, 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Node 3, 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Node 2, 5 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Node 2, 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Node 2, 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Node 5, 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4, 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 3 to 9:
    - Skip because there are no possible triangles involving nodes greater than 2.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
