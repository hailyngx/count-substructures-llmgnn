Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
