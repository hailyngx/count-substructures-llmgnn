Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 11: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 12: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 13: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6 to Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
