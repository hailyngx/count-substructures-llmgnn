Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
