Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - <0, 4, 6> - Formed by edges (0, 4), (0, 2), (4, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - <0, 2, 6> - Formed by edges (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
    - <0, 6, 8> - Formed by edges (0, 5), (0, 4), (5, 8)
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. **Node 6:**
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - <4, 6, 7> - Formed by edges (4, 7), (4, 6), (6, 7)
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. **Node 8:**
    - <1, 6, 8> - Formed by edges (1, 8), (1, 9), (8, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. **Node 9:**
    - <1, 6, 9> - Formed by edges (1, 9), (1, 8), (9, 6)
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
