Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes less than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as all possible triangles have already been counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
