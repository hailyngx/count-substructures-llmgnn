Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * Skip these nodes as they have smaller numbered nodes that have already been considered.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0).
Therefore, the final answer is [1].

The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 4>.
