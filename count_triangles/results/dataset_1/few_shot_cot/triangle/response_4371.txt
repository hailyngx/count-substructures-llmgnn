Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 3 to form a triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 4 to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 5 to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 6 to form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 7 to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 8 to form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No pairs available for Node 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
