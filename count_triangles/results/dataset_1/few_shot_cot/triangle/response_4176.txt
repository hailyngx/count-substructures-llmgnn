Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

    * Node 0: No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * No triangle can be formed as there is only one pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No triangle can be formed as there is only one pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 4.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangle can be formed as there is only one pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * No triangle can be formed as there is only one pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 7.

    * Node 8 and Node 9: No triangles can be formed as there is a lack of at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

    Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
