Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected because there is no edge (2, 5). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, 4, 5, or 6, as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
