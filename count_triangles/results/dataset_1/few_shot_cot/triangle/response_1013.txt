Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle(s) involving Node 0: <0, 3, 4>

* Node 1:
    * No pairs eligible to form triangles with node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle(s) involving Node 2: <1, 2, 4>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 4.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle(s) involving Node 3: <2, 4, 8>

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs eligible to form triangles with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other pairs eligible to form triangles with node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs eligible to form triangles with node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
