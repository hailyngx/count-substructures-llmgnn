Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, here is the breakdown for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 7, and 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed for these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
