Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No other nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No other nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
