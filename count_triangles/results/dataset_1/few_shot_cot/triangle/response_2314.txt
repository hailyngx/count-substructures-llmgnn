Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}
