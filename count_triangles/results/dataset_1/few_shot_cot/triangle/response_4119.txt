Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
