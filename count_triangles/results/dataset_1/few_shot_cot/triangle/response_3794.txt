Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 1 to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs including Node 0, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 5 due to smaller numbering.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs including Node 3 because it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
