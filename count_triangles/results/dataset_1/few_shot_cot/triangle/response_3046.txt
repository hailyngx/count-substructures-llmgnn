Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) - No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) - No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) - No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) - No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - Triangle formed with nodes 2, 4, and 5. <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
