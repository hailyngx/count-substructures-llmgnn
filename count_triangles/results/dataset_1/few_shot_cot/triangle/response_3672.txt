Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4, 9, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip because there are no nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
