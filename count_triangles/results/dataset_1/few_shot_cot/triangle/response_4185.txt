Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
