Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 5 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
