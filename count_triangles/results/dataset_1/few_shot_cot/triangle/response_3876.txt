Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> These two nodes are not connected. No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs involving nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with.

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> These two nodes are connected as shown in the edge list. No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
