Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's find the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 4 as there are no connections.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
