Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Node 1 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Node 1 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 forms triangles with all of its 1-hop neighbors. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Node 9 and Node 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are connected. One side of a triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Node 9 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and they are directly connected. One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
