Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. (Already counted with Node 0)

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
[<0, 4, 5>]
