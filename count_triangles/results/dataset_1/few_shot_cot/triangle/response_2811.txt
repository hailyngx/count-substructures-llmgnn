Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the approach from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip (3, 5) as 3 is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip (1, 4) since both smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 4), but since 6 is smaller than 7, this is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
