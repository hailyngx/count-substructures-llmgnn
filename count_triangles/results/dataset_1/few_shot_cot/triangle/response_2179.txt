Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs possible with remaining nodes, so no triangles with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Next, we will continue this process for nodes 2 to 9 and then count the total number of triangles in the graph.

* Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
