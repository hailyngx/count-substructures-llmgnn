Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs including smaller numbered nodes.
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs including smaller numbered nodes.
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>.
