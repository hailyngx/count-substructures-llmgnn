Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to find the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (1, 3) <1, 3, 0>
   * Pair 2: (1, 5) <1, 5, 0>
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
   * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Node 3 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
   * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Node 6 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
