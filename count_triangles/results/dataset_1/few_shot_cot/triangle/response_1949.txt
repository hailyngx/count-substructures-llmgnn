Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with node 3 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Triangle formed with node 3 and 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 5.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 9.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 6.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Triangle formed with node 4 and 7.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with node 5 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed with node 5 and 7.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
