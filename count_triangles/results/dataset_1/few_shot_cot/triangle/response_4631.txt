Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 1 as it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 2 as it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
