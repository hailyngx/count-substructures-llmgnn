Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the first example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 because they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
