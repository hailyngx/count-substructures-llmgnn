Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Since 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, no triangle is formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
