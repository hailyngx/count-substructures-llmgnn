Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Node 1 does not form any triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Node 2 does not form any triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Node 4 does not form any triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Node 6 does not form any triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Node 8 does not form any triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
