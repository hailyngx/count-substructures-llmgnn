Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4).
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor, which is smaller than Node 1.

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 9).
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 5:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one 1-hop neighbor, which is smaller than Node 5.

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (9, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) - Both 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 3).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    * No possible triangle as the only 1-hop neighbor is smaller than Node 8.

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (4, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [8].

<0, 1, 4>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 3, 8>, <7, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <9, 4, 6>
