Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as remaining nodes are of higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
