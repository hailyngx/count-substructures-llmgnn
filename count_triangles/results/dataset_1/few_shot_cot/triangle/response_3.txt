Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
The task is to find the number of triangles in the given graph. Let's go step-by-step through each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with a single neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with a single neighbor.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with a single neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
