Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2...8, 9 as they are greater than 0. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is greater than 4. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 5. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 6. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No viable pairs left to form triangles as all other nodes are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
