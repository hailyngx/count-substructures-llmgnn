Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
        * No other pairs available. No additional triangles possible with Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node due to the absence of connected pairs.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are connected.
        * No other pairs available. No additional triangles possible with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node due to the absence of connected pairs.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No other pairs available. No additional triangles possible with Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node due to the absence of connected pairs.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

    Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
