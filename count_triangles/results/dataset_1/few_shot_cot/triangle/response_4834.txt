Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No edge exists between 1 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No edge exists between 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Edge (2, 3) exists. Nodes 0, 2, and 3 form a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No edge exists between 2 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No edge exists between 4 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Edge (4, 9) exists. Nodes 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Edge (4, 9) exists. Nodes 4, 6, and 9 form a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs for Node 9 as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
