Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 7>]
