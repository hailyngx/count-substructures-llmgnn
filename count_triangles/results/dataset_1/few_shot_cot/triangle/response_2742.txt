Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to consider with nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to consider with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to consider with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
