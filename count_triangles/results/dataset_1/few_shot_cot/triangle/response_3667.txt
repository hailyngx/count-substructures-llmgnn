Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
   
2. Node 1:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
   - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
