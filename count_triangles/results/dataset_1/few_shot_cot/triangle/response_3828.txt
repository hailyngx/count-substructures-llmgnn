Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions and applying the triangle counting method to each node in the graph, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs since there is no 1-hop neighbor for node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
