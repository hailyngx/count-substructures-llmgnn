Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6:
    * Skip these nodes as they have smaller node numbers.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
