Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided with the information given:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2. No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4. No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9. No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are <0, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 4>, <4, 8, 7>, and <8, 3, 4>.
