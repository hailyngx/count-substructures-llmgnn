Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
