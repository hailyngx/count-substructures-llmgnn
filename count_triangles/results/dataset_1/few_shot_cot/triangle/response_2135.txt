1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
* Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Moving on to Node 1:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
* Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Moving on to Node 2:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

Moving on to Node 3:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3. 
* Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
* Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Moving on to Node 4:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
* Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Moving on to Node 5:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

Moving on to Node 6:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

Moving on to Node 7:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
* Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
* No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

Moving on to Node 8:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

Finally, for Node 9:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
* No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
