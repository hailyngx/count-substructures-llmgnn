Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Only 1 neighbor pair available which is smaller than Node 1 (0, 1). No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No neighbor pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
