Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider since there are no neighbors for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
