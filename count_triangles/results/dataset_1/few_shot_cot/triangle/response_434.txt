Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 0, 8>, <7, 6, 9>]
