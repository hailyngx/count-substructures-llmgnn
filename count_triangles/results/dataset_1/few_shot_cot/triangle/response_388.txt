Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example mentioned earlier, here is the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Since Node 9 has no 1-hop neighbors, there can be no triangles involving Node 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

    Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
