Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
