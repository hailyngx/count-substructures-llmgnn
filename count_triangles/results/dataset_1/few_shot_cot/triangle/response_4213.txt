Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
[1] <4, 6, 9>
