Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the same process as the example, we can count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected in the edge list forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node <2, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No other possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
