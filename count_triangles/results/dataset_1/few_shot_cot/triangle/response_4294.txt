Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (4, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as nodes 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 2:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 3:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 4:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 6:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 7:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 8:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 9:
    * Skip due to the smaller numbered nodes. No triangles possible.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
     
Hence, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
