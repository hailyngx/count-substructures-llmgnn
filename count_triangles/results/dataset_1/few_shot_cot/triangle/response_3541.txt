Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Does not have any neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * They each have fewer than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
