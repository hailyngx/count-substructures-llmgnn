Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) - 8 and 8 are the same node. This is not a valid pair for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs less than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs less than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs less than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) - 8 and 8 are the same node. This is not a valid pair for a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs less than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs less than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
