1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, a triangle <1, 2, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, a triangle <2, 4, 7> is formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, a triangle <2, 6, 8> is formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 8 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, a triangle <2, 7, 8> is formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, a triangle <2, 7, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, a triangle <3, 5, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, a triangle <4, 7, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are directly connected in the graph. Now, check if 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. Since 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, a triangle <7, 8, 9> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
