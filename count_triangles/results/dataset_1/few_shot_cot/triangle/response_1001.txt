Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 14: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0)
* Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 7, 8>.
