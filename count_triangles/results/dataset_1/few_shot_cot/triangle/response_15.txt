Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
