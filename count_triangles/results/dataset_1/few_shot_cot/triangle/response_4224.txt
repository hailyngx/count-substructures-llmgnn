Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. 
    <1, 5, 6> triangle found.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. 
    <2, 4, 6> triangle found.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No triangle can be formed using Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or greater.
    - No triangle can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No triangle can be formed using Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is its own 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No triangle can be formed using Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No triangle can be formed using Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
[<1, 5, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 8, 9>]
