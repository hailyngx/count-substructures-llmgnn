Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same steps as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that involves Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that involves Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that involves Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
