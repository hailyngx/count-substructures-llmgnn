Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
