Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (Triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> These nodes are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Pair skipped as 7 is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <1, 5, 7>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <2, 5, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as smaller numbered nodes have already been considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <6, 8, 9>)

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <2, 5, 7>)

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
