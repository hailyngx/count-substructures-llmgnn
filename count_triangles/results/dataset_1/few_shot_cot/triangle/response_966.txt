Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 4>, <3, 4, 5>]
