Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Skip pair that includes Node 3 as it is not connected to Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as they are smaller than 3 and there is only one 1-hop neighbor. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are all smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are all smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
