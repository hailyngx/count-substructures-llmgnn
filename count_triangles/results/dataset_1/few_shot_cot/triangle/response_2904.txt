Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Ignored as 5 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Ignored as 8 is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Ignored as 8 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Ignored as 4 is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible as 7 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
