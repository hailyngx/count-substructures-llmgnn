Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the previous example's approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 0), but since 7 and 0 are both smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
