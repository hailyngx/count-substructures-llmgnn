Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected as (9, 7) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 6, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <6, 7, 9>, <8, 5, 9>.
