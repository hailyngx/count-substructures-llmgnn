Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
