Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected even though both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected even though both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected even though both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1: (3, 5) as they are not connected.
    * Skip Pair 2: (3, 6) as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as shown in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Skip Pair 3: (8, 9) as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
