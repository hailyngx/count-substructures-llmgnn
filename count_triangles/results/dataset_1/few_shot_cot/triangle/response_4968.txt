Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6}

Response:
Let's go through each node to find the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are not directly connected, although both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4 (Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 7>)

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
