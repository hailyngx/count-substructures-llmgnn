Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the counting triangles method given in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Also forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Also forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    - Unique triangles for Node 1: <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>

3. **Node 2**:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles for Node 2: <2, 5, 8>

4. **Node 3**:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0,1,2,3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles for Node 4: <4, 5, 6>

6. **Node 5**:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 1,2,4 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 1,2,4,5 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles for Node 6: <4, 5, 6>

8. **Node 7**:
    - Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8 and Node 9**:
    - Skipped since there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Calculating the total triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

[<1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>]
