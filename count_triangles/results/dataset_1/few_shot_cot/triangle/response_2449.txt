Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected directly, so no triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
