1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles possible as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 -> {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}. 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 1 is already connected to 2. So, the triangle <1, 2, 7> is formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 -> {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}. 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6 and 1 is already connected to 4. So, the triangle <1, 4, 6> is formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 -> {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}. 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 1 is already connected to 4. So, the triangle <1, 4, 7> is formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<1, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 6>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 since it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected. Checking the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 -> {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}. 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 2 is already connected to 5. So, the triangle <2, 5, 7> is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 5, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles possible as Node 3 only has 2 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible as Node 4 only has 3 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles possible as Node 7 only has 4 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible as Node 8 only has 2 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles possible as Node 9 only has 2 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
