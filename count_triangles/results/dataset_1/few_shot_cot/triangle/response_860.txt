Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
