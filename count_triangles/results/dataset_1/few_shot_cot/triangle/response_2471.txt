Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example above, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
