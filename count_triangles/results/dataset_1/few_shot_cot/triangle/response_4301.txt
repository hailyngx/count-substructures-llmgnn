Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
