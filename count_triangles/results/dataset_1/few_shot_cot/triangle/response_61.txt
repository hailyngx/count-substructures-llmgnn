Response:
Following the method described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
