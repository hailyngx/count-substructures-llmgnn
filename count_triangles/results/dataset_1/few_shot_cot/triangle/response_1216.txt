Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as detailed in the example earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
