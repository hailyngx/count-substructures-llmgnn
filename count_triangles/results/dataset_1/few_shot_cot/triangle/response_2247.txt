Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 2 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 5 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 2 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No third node connected to both 7 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped as no pairs can be formed involving nodes with greater numbers.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. They form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they have smaller numbers.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
