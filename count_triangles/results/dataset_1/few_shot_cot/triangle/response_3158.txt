Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed since 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors exist for Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No need to check as all the other nodes are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed due to lack of suitable pairs.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No need to check pairs with smaller nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No need to check pairs with smaller nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No need to check pairs with smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
