Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs involving Node 6 due to lack of 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
