Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 7

* Node 8:
    * Triangles:
        * <3, 5, 8>
        * <5, 6, 8>
        * <8, 9, 0>
        * <8, 9, 2>

    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.


Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
