Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 (smaller than 7) or with Node 8 (no other nodes to form a triangle with).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.  

So, the final answer is [2].
