Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example in the initial prompt, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0 and Node 1 are not connected.
2. Node 0 and Node 2 are not connected.
3. Node 0 and Node 3 are not connected.
4. Node 0 and Node 4 are not connected.
5. Node 0 and Node 5 are not connected.
6. Node 0 and Node 6 are not connected.
7. Node 0 and Node 7 are not connected.
8. Node 0 and Node 8 are not connected.
9. Node 0 and Node 9 are not connected.

10. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

11. Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

12. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1

13. Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1

14. Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 1

15. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1

16. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 1

17. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0

18. Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
