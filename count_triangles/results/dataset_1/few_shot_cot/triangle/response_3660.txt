Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) is shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) is shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) is shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Skip the pair (3, 7) as it has been counted when considering Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) is shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) is shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair (3, 7) as it has been counted when considering Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) is shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pair (4, 8) as it has been counted when considering Node 4.
    * Skip the pair (7, 8) as it has been counted when considering Nodes 3 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as there are no 1-hop neighbors. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
