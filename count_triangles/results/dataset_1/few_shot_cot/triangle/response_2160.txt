Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Applying the same step-by-step process as shown in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
  * Pairs with smaller nodes are skipped as shown in the previous example.
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Potential triangle found.
  * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Only possible pair is (5, 6) which are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
  * Repeating the process for each node, we find that no other nodes can form triangles when taken as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
