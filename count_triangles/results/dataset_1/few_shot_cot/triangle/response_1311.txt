Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with a node greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
