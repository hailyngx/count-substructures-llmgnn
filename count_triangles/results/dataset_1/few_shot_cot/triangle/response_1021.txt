Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 5, 9>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) and (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 3, 4>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 5, 8>)

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 8, 9>)

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 7, 9>)

* Node 7:
    * No pair to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pair to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pair to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
