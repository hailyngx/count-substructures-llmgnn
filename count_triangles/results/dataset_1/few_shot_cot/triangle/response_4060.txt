Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the given steps, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
