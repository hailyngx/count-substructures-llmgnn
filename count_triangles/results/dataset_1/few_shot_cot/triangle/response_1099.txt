Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the method described earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No adjacent nodes to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No adjacent nodes to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
