Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Skip because 2 is greater than 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Skip because 3 is greater than 0.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Skip because 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Skip because 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Skip because 0 is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Skip because 0 is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
