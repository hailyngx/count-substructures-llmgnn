Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 5 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8: 
    * Skip Node 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
