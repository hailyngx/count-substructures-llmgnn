Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and Node 7 are connected, but Node 2 doesn't have Node 7 in its 1-hop neighbor set. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
