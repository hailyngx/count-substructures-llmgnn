Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected with edge (3, 5). No common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected with edge (3, 8). No common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected with edge (3, 9). No common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected with edge (4, 7). No common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected with edge (4, 8). 8 is the common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected with edge (7, 8). No common neighbor to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 3 are covered in the previous steps.

* Node 4:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 4 are covered in the previous steps.

* Node 5:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 5 are covered in the previous steps.

* Node 6:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 7 are covered in the previous steps.

* Node 8:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 8 are covered in the previous steps.

* Node 9:
    - Skipped as all possible triangles involving Node 9 are covered in the previous steps.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
