Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
