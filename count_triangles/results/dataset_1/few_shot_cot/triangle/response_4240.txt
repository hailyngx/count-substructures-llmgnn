Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 9) -> Node 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected as there is no edge (7, 9). No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Node 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 4:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 5:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 6:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 7:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 8:
    - No triangle formed.

- Node 9:
    - No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
