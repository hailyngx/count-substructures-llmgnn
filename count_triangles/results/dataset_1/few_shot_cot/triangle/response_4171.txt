Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the methodology provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:  
    - Triangle <4, 7, 9>: 4, 7, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are connected in the graph.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

3. Node 2:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 without using smaller numbered nodes.

4. Node 3:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no triangles involving 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.

5. Node 4:  
    - Triangle <6, 7, 9>: 6, 7, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 and are connected in the graph.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no triangles involving 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.

7. Node 6:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 without using smaller numbered nodes.

8. Node 7:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 without using smaller numbered nodes.

9. Node 8:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 without using smaller numbered nodes.

10. Node 9:  
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 without using smaller numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [2].
