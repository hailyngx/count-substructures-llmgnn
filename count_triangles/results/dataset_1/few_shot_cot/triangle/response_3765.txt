Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [4].
