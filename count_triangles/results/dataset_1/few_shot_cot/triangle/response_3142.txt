Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Applying the same step-by-step process as shown in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle formed from Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle formed from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle formed from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle formed from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
