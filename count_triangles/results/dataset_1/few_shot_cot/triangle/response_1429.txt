Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the steps shown in the example above to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
