Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skipped as it is smaller than Nodes 0 and 1.

    * Node 3:
        * Skipped since it is smaller than Nodes 1 and 6.

    * Node 4:
        * No neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

    * Node 5:
        * No neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

    * Node 6:
        * No triangles as any pairs involving 6 and another node have already been covered earlier.

    * Node 7:
        * Skipped in this step.

    * Node 8:
        * No triangles possible as there is only one neighbor.

    * Node 9:
        * Skipped as it is smaller in value than Node 8.
        
    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.
    
    Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

    So, the final answer is [1].
