Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}
