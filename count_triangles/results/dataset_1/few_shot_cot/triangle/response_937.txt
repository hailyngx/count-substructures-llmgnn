Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Not enough nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, and 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
