Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

        * Node 1:
            There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected in the graph.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 7:
            There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

        * Node 9:
            There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>.

        The final answer is [6].
