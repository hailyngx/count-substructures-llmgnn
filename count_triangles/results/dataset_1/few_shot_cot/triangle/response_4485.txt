Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as demonstrated earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 0 are also connected as (0, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6 triangles] in the given graph.
