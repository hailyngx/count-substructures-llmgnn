Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
