Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 1 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 4. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 6. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 7. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider since all other nodes are smaller than 9. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
