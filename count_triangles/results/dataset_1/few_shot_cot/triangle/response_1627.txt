Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed between nodes 1, 2, and 0.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed between nodes 1, 4, and 0.
  * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed between nodes 1, 6, and 0.
  * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed between nodes 1, 7, and 0.
  * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 1, 8, and 0.
  * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed between nodes 2, 4, and 0.
  * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
  * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed between nodes 2, 7, and 0.
  * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.
  * Pair 10: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
  * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed between nodes 4, 7, and 0.
  * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 4, 8, and 0.
  * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
  * Pair 14: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 6, 8, and 0.
  * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 7, 8, and 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed between nodes 3, 6, and 2.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 3, 8, and 2.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 6, 8, and 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed between nodes 6, 7, and 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed between nodes 7, 8, and 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>]
