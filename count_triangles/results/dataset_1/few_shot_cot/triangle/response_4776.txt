Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 because it has a smaller node number.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 because it has a smaller node number.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * No triangles can be formed involving these nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 and 2 because they have smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs containing Node 0 and 1 because they have smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
