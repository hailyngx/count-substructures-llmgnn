Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 9 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 8 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7 as they are all connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 8 as they are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there are no other nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [7] <0, 4, 7> <3, 4, 7> <3, 5, 9> <4, 5, 8> <5, 6, 7> <5, 7, 9> <4, 7, 8>.
