Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 2 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 8 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 5 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 8 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 8 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> 5 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, 8 is 1-hop neighbor with 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 is 1-hop neighbor with 1, 9 is 1-hop neighbor with 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3, 7:
    * Skip, as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Continuing this process for the remaining nodes, we find:

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
