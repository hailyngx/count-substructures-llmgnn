Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 6. <0, 1, 6>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1, Node 7. <1, 7, 9>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2, Node 4. <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Skipped as Node 5 is smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 6. <4, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 7. <4, 7, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, Node 9. <4, 7, 9>

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 8. <4, 6, 8>
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, Node 9. <0, 6, 9>

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7, Node 8. <4, 7, 9>

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The answer is [9].
