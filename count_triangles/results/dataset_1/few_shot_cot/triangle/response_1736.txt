Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 does not have any connections, so no triangles can be formed with this node.

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 1 and Node 0 are smaller than Node 2, we skip these nodes.
    * There are no possible triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (3, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all other nodes as they are greater than 5.
    * There are no possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 2 and Node 0.
    * There are no possible triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (3, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all other nodes as they are greater than 8.
    * There are no possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair left is (3, 4), where both nodes are smaller, so we skip this pair.
    * There are no possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
