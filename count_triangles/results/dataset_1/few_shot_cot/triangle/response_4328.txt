Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected since (1, 0) and (0, 4) edges exist. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 0) -> 1 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 0 are connected since (1, 0) edge exists. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 5 are connected since (3, 5) edge exists. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are connected since (5, 8) edge exists. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
