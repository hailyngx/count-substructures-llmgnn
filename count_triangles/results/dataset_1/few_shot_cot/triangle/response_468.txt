Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as there are no pairs with higher numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
