Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
