Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 2, as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs that are greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
