Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
