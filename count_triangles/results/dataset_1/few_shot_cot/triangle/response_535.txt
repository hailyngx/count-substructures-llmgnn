Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Nodes 5, 9: No triangles can be formed with these isolated nodes.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
