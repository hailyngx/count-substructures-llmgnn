Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

The final answer is [0].
