Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example for each node in the given graph to count the number of triangles:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list. Note this triangle: <0, 2, 9>.
            * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
        The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, and <2, 5, 7>.
