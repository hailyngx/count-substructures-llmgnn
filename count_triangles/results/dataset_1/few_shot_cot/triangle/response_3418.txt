Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle <1, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No additional triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * No triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
