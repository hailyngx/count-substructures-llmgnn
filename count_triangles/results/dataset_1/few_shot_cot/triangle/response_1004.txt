Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:
        
        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, as (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, as (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * The only pair we could consider is (1, 5), but since 1 and 5 are both smaller than 2, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since 6 and 9 are both smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (8, 0), but since 8 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles: 
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
