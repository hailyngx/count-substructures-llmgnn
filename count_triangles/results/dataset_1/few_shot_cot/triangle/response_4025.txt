Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 3) -> Ignored as it's a self-loop.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
