Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 8 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 9 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 3 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
