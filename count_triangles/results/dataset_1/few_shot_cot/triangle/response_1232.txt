Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
