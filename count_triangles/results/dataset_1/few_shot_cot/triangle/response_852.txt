Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No connected pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 5, 7>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 9, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>]
