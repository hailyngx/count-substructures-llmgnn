Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 has no 2-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Node 8 has no 2-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Node 9 has no 2-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
