Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, we'll count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) - 8 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
