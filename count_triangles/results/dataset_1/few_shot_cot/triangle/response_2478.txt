Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 as they are greater than 0.
            * No triangles found for Node 0.

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 5, 6 as they are greater than 1.
            * No triangles found for Node 1.

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 8 as they are greater than 2.
            * No triangles found for Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 4.
            * No triangles found for Node 4.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 9 as they are greater than 5.
            * No triangles found for Node 5.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 6.
            * No triangles found for Node 6.

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (4, 5), but since 4 and 5 are greater than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * No triangles found for Node 7.

        * Node 8:
            * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
