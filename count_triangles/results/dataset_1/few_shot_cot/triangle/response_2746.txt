Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * The only pair with nodes larger than 1 is (7, 2), but this pair is not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No pairs with larger nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The only pair with a larger node is (6, 5), and they are connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No pairs with larger nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs with larger nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * One pair (2, 3) with larger nodes, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
