Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
