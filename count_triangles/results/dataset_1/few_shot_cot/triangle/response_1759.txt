Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 9 as they are larger than 0.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6, and 8 as they are larger than 1.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is larger than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, and 7 as they are larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No neighbours to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
