Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The remaining nodes do not form triangles based on the current available nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found:
[<0, 2, 5>]
