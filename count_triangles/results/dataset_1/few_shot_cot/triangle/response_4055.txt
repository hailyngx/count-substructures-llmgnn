Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Node 9 is directly connected to Node 6. So, triangle <0, 6, 9> formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Node 7 is directly connected to Node 9. So, triangle <0, 7, 9> formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Node 8 is directly connected to Node 9. So, triangle <0, 8, 9> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 4 is directly connected to Node 8. So, triangle <2, 4, 8> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Node 6 is directly connected to Node 9. So, triangle <4, 6, 9> formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
