Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed as it has no neighbors.
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as it has only one neighbor.
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
