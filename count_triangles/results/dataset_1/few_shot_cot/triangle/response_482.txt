Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 7:
    * Proceeding in a similar manner, let's check for triangles for Nodes 4, 5, and 7 as the smallest numbered nodes.
    * Node 4: 1 triangle
    * Node 5: 1 triangle
    * Node 7: 1 triangle

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough higher-numbered nodes to form triangles with 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [10]
