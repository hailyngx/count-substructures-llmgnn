Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
