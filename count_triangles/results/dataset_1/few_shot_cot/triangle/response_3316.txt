Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
