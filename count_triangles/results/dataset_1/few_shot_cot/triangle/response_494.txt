Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
