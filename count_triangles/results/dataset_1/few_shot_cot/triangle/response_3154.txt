Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 4) and (3, 5) in the edge list. Two triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as all the potential pairs with smaller nodes have been covered in their corresponding calculations.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as all the potential pairs with smaller nodes have been covered in their corresponding calculations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
