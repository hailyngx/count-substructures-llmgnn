Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the same method outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * No pairs involving Node 0 or Node 1 to consider.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
  * No other pair to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (all other nodes) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
