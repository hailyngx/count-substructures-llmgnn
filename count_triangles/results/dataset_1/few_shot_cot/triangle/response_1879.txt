Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are greater than 0.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are greater than 1.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is greater than 2.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is greater than 3.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is greater than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pair with Node 8 as it is greater than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pair as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
