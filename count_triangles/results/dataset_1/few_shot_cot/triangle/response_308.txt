Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's go through each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 5, so <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with lower-numbered nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* There are no triangles found for any other nodes.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
