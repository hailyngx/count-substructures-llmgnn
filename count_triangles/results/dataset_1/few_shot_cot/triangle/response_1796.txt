Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangle can be formed with node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <0, 2, 4>, <4, 5, 8>. 
So, the answer is [3].
