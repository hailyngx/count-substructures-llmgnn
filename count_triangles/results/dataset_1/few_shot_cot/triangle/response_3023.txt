Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or Node 2 as they are smaller than Node 0.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 9), but since 1 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
