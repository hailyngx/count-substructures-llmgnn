Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle can be formed for Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, and 8:
    * Skipped for the same reason as seen in the previous examples.

* Node 7:
    * Skip edges with smaller nodes than 7 and itself.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
