Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 0 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
