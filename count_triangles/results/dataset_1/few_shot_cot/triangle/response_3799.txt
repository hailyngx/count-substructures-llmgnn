Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node.

    * Node 2:
        * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node.

    * Node 3:
        * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (7, 0) - 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 0 are not connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) - 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node.

    * Node 7:
        * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node.

    * Node 9:
        * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

    Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
