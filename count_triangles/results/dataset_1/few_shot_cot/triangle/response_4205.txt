Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs remained to form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
