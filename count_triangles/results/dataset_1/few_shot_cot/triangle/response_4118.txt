Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed with Node 5.

* Node 6 and Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Nodes 6 and 7 as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Output: [0]
