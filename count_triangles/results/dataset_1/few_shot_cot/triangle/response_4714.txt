Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 1 are also connected as (3, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
