Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no neighbors.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
