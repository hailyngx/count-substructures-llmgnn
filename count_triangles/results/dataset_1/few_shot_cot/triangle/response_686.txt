Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph: 

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 5) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
