Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
