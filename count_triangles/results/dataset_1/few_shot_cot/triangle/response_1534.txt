Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no (6, 7) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with Node 0 were checked earlier.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to consider with nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
