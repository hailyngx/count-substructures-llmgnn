Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example with the given graph, let's count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Also, 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form any triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Also, 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no triangles formed with its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No 3-node combinations can be formed with the 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No 3-node combinations can be formed with the 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No 3-node combinations can be formed with the 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No 3-node combinations can be formed with the 1-hop neighbors of Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No 3-node combinations can be formed with the 1-hop neighbors of Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
