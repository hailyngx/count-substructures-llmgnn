Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1. No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2. No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5. No more triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
