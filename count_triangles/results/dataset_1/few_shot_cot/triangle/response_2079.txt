Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and Node 8 are connected via (2, 9) and (9, 8), forming a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are connected via (5, 8) and (8, 4), forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and Node 8 are connected via (4, 8) and (8, 5), forming a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Node 6 is the only neighbor for Node 7, and there are no triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are connected via (5, 8) and (8, 9), forming a triangle with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
