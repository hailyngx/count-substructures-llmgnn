Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
