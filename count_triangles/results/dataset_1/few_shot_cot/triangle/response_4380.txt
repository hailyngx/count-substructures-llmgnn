Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list, but 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles, we skip calculating triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
