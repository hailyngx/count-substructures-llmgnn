Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as it only has 3 neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as it only has 3 neighbors.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as it only has 3 neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
