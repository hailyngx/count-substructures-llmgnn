Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangle involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors and thus no triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle involving Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
