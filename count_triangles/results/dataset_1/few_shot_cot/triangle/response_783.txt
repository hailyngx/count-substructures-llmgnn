Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, the count of triangles for each node is as follows:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: **1**

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors, so it cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: **0**

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: **1**

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: **1**

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: **0**

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: **0**

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: **0**

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: **1**

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: **0**

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: **1**

Summarizing the triangles:
**[3]**

The unique triangles found are:
**<5, 6, 7>**
