Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Triangle: <1, 4, 7> - 1, 4, and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and form a triangle. <1, 4, 7> is a unique triangle.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles that involve nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3)
* Final answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph which is <1, 4, 7>.
