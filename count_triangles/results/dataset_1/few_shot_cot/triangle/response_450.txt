Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method as demonstrated before, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 7. <0, 2, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 1. <1, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 2. <1, 2, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 4. <4, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with node 7. <4, 0, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
