Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) - Self-loop, can't form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
