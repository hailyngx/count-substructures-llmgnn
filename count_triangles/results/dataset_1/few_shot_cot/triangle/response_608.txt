Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs possible for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs possible for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs possible for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
