Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1 as those are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as those are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as those are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as those are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 3), but since 1 and 3 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as those are smaller.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as those are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
