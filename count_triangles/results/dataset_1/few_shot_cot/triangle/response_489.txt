Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> Both 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is greater than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 8 as it is smaller than Node 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
