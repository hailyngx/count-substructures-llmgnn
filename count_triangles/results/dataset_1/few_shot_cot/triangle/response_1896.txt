Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to check as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4 and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to check as all neighbors are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to check as the only neighbor is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, and 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to check as all neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
