Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> Skipped because it's a self-loop, and we only count distinct edges.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> Skipped due to self-loop.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> Skipped due to self-loop.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
