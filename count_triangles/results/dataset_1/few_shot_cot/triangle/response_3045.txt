Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 

[<3, 5, 6>]
