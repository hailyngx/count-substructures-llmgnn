Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No potential triangle pairs.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
