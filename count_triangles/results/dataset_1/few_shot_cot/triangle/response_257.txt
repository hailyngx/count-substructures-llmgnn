Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 6) is in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
