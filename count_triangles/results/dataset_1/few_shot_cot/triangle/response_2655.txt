Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as mentioned in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pair with Node 0.
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 1, 6>
<0, 9, 8>
<0, 8, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
