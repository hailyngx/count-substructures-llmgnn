Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
