Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example given, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * No other pairs involving Node 1 can form triangles with different nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, 3, and 4:
  * Skipping pairs that involve Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Nodes 2, 3, and 4.
  * Nodes 2, 3, and 4 have no other nodes to form triangles with, so no triangles are formed.

* Node 5:
  * No other nodes to form triangles with.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * No other pairs involving Node 6 can form triangles with different nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6.
  * No other pairs involving Node 7 can form triangles with different nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there are no pairs of nodes greater than Nodes 8 and 9 to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
