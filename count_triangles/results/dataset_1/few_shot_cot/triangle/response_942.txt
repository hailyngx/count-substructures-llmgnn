Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair involving Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair involving Node 1 as it is smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
