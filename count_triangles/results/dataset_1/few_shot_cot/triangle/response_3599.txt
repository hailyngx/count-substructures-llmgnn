Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1, 3, 4, 5:
    * Can't form triangles as there are no pairs of nodes greater than themselves.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) - 5 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Can't form triangles as there are no pairs of nodes greater than itself.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
