Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the adjacency list and edge list given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 3) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 1) -> Not considered because it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Since Node 9 has only 1 1-hop neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 5, 7>, <1, 8, 7>]
