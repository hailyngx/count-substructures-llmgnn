Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Node 3 cannot form any triangles.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
