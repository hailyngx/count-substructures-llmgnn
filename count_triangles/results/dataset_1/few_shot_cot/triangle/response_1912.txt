Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> Same as above, results in the same triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
