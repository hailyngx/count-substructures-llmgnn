Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are larger than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with larger nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes 7, 8, or 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes 8 or 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 9 as it is a larger node.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
