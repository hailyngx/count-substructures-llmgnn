Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Nodes 1 and 5 are not connected in the edge list.
    * No triangles found with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles found with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected in the edge list.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Nodes 5 and 8 are connected in the edge list.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
