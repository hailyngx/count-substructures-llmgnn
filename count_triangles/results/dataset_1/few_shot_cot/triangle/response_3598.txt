Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip this node since there are no triangles that can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (<2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 9>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 7, 9>]
