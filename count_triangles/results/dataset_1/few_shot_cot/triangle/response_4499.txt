Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - The pairs involving Node 0 are considered, so we skip them.
    - No more pairs left to consider for Node 1. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    - No more pairs left to consider for Node 4. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Node 5 only has one neighbor and cannot form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs left to consider for Node 6. Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller.
    - No more pairs left to consider for Node 7. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Node 8 only has two neighbors and cannot form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) - Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more pairs left to consider for Node 9. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7]. The unique triangles found in the graph are <1, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 6>, and <6, 7, 3>.
