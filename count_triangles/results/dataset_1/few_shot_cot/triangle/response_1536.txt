Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with only Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
