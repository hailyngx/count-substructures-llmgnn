Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
