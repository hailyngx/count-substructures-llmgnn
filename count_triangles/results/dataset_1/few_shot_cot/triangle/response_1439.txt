Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 6), but since 4 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider with other nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
