Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the process detailed in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 14: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
