Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 3) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 7) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edges. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with smaller-numbered nodes.
  - No new triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

[6 triangles found in the graph: <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 3>]
