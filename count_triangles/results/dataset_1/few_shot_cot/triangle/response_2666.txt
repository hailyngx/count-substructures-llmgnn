Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 7: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 9: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
  * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
  * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
  * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
