Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 3), but since 8 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
