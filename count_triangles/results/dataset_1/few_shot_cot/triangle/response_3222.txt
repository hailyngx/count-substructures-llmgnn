Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 does not have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is connected to Node 8, forming a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 does not have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 is involved in triangles with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has triangles with Nodes 3, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 4 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 13

Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the given graph.
