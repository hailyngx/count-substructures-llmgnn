Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No pairs to consider for each of these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
