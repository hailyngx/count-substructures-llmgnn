Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Node 1 contributes 1 triangle.

3. **Node 2:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. **Node 4:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. **Node 5:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

8. **Node 7:**
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Node 7 contributes 1 triangle.

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. **Node 9:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Node 9 contributes 4 triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
