1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Node 0, 2, and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Node 0, 4, and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Node 1, 3, and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Node 2, 3, and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Triangle: <2, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 3, 4, and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 4, 6, and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
