Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 4), but since 8 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than all other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
