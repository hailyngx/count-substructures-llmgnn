Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example shown before, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  - Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  - Pair 1: (9, 4) - Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
