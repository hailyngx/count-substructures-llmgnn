Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also directly connected as (1, 2) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as (2, 6) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also directly connected as (2, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as (7, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected as (2, 8) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected as (3, 6) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as (5, 8) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as (5, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 2 and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
