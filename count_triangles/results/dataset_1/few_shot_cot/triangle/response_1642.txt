Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 5), but since 0 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only Node 8 or 9.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = **8**.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 9>]
