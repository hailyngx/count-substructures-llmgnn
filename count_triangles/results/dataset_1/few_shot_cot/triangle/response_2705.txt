Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same detailed process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Now, let's find the third node connected to both 5 and 8:
            * (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
    * Node 1, 2, and 3:
        * As there are no pairs of nodes with neighbors higher than these nodes, we skip them.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Now, let's find the third node connected to both 5 and 9:
            * (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Now, let's find the third node connected to both 8 and 9:
            * (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6 and Node 7:
        * No pairs found with nodes higher than 6 and 7, so they are skipped.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Now, let's find the third node connected to both 9 and 4:
            * (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs involving nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
