Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No neighboring nodes to form triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No pair available to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    No pair available to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    No neighboring nodes large enough to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    No pair available to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    No pair available to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No pair available to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    No pair available to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
