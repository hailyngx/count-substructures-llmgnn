Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles starting from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 7>]
