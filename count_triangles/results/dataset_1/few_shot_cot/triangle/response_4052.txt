Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - No pairs for Node 2 to form triangles.

- Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed with 3 as the smallest node.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No pairs for Node 5 to form triangles.

- Node 6:
    - No pairs for Node 6 to form triangles.

- Node 7:
    - No pairs for Node 7 to form triangles.

- Node 8:
    - No pairs for Node 8 to form triangles.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

<Applying the same process described in the example for counting triangles in the provided graph, the total number of triangles is 6.>
