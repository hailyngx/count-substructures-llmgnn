Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are directly connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
