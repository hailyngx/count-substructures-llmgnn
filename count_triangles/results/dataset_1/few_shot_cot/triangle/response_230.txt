Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0)
Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
