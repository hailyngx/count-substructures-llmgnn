Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than 6. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 9. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
