Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle as node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle as node 4 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle as node 5 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle as node 6 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle as node 7 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle as node 9 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
