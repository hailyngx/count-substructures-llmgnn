Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * No triangles possible with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles possible with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (1, 6).
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles possible with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles possible with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
