Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there are no pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
[<3, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>]
