Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 0.

- **Node 1**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 1.

- **Node 2**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 2.

- **Node 3**:
    - No possible triangles with Node 3.

- **Node 4**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4.

- **Node 5**:
    - No possible triangles with Node 5.

- **Node 6**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - No possible triangles with Node 6.

- **Node 7**:
    - No possible triangles with Node 7.

- **Node 8**:
    - Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 9**:
    - No possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
