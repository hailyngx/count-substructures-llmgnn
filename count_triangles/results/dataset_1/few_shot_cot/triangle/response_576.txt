Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Proceeding with counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 2:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 7) in the list.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) and (6, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are directly connected.

* Node 8:
    - Node 8 only has one neighbor and hence cannot form triangles.

* Node 9:
    - Node 9 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
