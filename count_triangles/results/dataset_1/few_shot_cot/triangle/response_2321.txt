Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to evaluate as both available neighbors are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to evaluate as all available neighbors are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to evaluate as both available neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
