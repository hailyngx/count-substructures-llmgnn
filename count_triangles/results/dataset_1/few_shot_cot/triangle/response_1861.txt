Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
          
        * Node 1:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no neighbors to form pairs with.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Similarly, skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
