Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that involve Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5, 6, 7:
    - No nodes greater than 5, 6, or 7 to form triangles with.

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 8.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
