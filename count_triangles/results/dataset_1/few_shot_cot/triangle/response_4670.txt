Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0: No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
- Node 2: No triangles can be formed as only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 3: No triangles can be formed as only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 4: No triangles can be formed as only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 5: No triangles can be formed as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 6: No triangles can be formed as only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 7: No triangles can be formed as only one 1-hop neighbor.
- Node 8: No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating all the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
