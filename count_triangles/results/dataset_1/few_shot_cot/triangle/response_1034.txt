Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to smaller node numbers.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (0) + 0 (1) + 3 (2) + 0 (3) + 1 (4) + 1 (5) + 0 (6) + 0 (7) + 0 (8) + 0 (9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
