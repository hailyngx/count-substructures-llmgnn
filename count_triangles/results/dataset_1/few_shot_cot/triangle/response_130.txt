Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1.
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6.
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 8.
    * No qualifying pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
