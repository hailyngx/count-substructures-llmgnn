1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
