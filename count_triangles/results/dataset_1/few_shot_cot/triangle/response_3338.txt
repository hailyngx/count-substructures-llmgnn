Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 9) -> Ignored as it is a self-loop.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
