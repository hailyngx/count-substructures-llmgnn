Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) - Both 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 7 has no 1-hop neighbors. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
