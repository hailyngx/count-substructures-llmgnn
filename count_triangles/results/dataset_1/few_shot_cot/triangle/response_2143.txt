Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles as 4 is not connected to any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles as 5 is not connected to any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles as 7 is not connected to any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles as 8 is not connected to any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles as 9 is not connected to any other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
