Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Note: Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 will not form any triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
