Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 2 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 2, and 5.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 2 and 9.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 5.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 9.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<0, 2, 5>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<3, 6, 7>]

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<4, 6, 7>]

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<5, 6, 7>]

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> No triangle formed as there is no edge between 8 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
