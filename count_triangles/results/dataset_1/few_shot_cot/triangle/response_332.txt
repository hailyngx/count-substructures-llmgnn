Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above:

    * Node 0:
        * No triangles possible with Node 0.

    * Node 1:
        * No triangles possible with Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
        * No triangles possible with Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
        * No triangles possible with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
        * No triangles possible with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
