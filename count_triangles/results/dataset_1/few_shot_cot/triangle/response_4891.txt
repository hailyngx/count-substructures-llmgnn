Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, we can now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped (2, 5) as 2 is not connected to 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it's smaller than Node 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs possible to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs possible to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
