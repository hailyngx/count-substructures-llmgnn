1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step applied to each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed between these two nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
