Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 6 is the largest neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 2 and 7 are both larger neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 4 is the largest neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 9 is the only neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 6 and 8 are both larger neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 5 is the only neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 8 is the larger neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 8 has no neighbors that are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes: 9 has no neighbors that are larger.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
