Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  No 2-hop neighbors available to form triangles.

* Node 1:
  No 2-hop neighbors available to form triangles.

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6).
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8).
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  No 2-hop neighbors available to form triangles.

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 6 are connected as (7, 6).
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 6 are connected as (8, 6).
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4).
  * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5).
  * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6).
  * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6).
  * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8).
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
  No 2-hop neighbors available to form triangles.

* Node 9:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5).
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
