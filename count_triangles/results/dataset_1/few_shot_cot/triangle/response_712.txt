Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 does not have any neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there's no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Node 4 does not have any neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Node 6 does not have any neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 7:
    * Node 7 does not have any neighbors to form a triangle with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Node 9 does not have any neighbors to form a triangle with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<5, 0, 8>, <8, 8, 9>]
