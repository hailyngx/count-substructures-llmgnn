Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 2's 1-hop neighbors are not connected to each other.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 4's 1-hop neighbor is not connected to any other neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 5 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 8's 1-hop neighbor is not connected to any other neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No additional triangles can be formed as Node 9's 1-hop neighbors are already part of triangles with other nodes.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>]
