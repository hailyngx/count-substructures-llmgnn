Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 9 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 that are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip this node as there are no pairs involving Node 2 where both nodes are greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 that are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 8 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 that are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 that are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 that are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 that are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
