Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
