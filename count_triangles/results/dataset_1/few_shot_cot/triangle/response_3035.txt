Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
