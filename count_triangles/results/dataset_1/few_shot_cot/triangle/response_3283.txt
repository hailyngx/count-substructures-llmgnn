    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
