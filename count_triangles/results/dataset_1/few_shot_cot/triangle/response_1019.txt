Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
