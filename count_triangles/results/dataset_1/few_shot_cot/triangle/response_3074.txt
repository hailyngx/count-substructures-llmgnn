Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
