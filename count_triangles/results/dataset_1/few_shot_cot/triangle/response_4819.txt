Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 2 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, forming a pair.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, forming a pair.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, forming a pair.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, forming a pair.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, forming a pair.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 5, forming a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed as the neighbor nodes are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed as the neighbor nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed as the neighbor node is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed as the neighbor node is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0
