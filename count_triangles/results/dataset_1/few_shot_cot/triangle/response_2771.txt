Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the given example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and 6 is also connected to 4 in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't sufficient nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
