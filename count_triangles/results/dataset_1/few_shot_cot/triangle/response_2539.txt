Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected since there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both greater than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (0, 6) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are not connected because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 8), but since 2 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
