Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 1**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 2**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 3**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 4**:
    - No neighbors, hence no triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 5**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 6**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 7**:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) - Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 8**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 9**:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles from each node, we get:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
