Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9:
    * Skipped as they have no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
