Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are **3 triangles** in the given graph.
