Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no nodes greater than 9.   
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
