Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3 as they are greater than 0. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3 as they are greater than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is greater than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes greater than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there isn't another node larger than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
