Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided above, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph based on the adjacency list and edge list.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total number of triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [2]
