Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph: 

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (2, 4, 5).
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (2, 4, 7).
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as (2, 4, 5).
        * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as (2, 4, 7).
        * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (2, 4, 5).
        * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (2, 4, 7).
        * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        * Not enough neighbors to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as (2, 4, 5).
        * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
