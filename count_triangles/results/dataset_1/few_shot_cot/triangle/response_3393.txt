Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Here is the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pairs involving smaller-numbered nodes have been counted.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as all possibilities have been covered in previous calculations.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
