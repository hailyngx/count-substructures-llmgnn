Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph using the method described in the example:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
