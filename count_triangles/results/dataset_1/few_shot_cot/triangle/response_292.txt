Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is a smaller numbered node.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
