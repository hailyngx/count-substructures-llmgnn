Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 1 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The triangles were either already counted with smaller nodes or cannot be formed with available nodes. No additional triangles for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The triangles were either already counted with smaller nodes or cannot be formed with available nodes. No additional triangles for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The triangles were either already counted with smaller nodes or cannot be formed with available nodes. No additional triangles for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The triangles were either already counted with smaller nodes or cannot be formed with available nodes. No additional triangles for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The triangles were either already counted with smaller nodes or cannot be formed with available nodes. No additional triangles for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (9, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
