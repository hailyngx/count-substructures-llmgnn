Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step following the process outlined in the previous example:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.

- Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.

- Node 4:
    * No connections, so no triangles involving Node 4.

- Node 5:
    * No triangles involving Node 5.

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6.

- Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.

- Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
