Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Nodes 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Nodes 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
