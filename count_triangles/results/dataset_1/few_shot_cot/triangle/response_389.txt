Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Triangle involving Node 2 is not possible as it only has one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 6), but since 0 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Triangle involving Node 8 is not possible as it only has two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
