Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph and the unique triangles found:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 0) -> 0 and 8 are directly connected, but 0 is smaller than 2. Skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
