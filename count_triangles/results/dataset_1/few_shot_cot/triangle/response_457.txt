Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
