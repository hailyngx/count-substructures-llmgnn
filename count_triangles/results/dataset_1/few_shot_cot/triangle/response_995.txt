Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected according to the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected according to the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 3) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected according to the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
