Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, here is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we find:

* Node 4:
    * Only one triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 6>.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
