Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
