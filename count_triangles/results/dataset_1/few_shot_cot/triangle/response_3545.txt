Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 3 are directly connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The triangle pairs have already been covered with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, so no additional triangles with 3 as the smallest numbered node are found.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list, no other triangles found.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Same triangles as with Node 0 and Node 1, so no additional triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Since Node 9 has no connections, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = [5].

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
