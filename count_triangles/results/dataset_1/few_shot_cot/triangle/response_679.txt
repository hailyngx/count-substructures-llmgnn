    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3. No suitable pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4. No suitable pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles possible with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7. No suitable pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No suitable pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
