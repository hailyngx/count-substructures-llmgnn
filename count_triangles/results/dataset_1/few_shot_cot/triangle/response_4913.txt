Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same methodology as the example given, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node's possible connections. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) and (5, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) and (8, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 3) and (3, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7) and (7, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 8) and (8, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 4) - Both 6 and 4 are directly connected as (6, 4) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) - Both 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 5) and (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) - Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 5) and (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 6, 9:
    * No triangles formed since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

The total count of triangles in the graph:
* Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
