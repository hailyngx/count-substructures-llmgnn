Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the same process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (0, 7), but since 0 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

        So, the answer is [3].
