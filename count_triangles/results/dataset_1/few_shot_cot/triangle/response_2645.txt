Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3, 6, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they do not have at least 2 other nodes greater than themselves.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
