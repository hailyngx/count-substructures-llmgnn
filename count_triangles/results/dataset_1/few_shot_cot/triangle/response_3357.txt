Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph by following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 4 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs since all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs since all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <7, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <7, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs since all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Final Answer: [3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10 triangles]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 4, 9>.
