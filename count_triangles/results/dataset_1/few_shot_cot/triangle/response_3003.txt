Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
