Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed for node 1 with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * No pairs can be formed for node 2 with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No pairs can be formed for node 6 with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

Triangles found:
<4, 5, 0>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 8, 9>
