Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Skip Nodes 0, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 6) and (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 4:
  - Skip Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
  - Skip Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
  - Due to the lack of at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes, no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 2>
<7, 8, 3>
