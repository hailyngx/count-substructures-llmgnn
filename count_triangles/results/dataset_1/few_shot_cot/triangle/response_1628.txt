Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 3.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No pairs left to form triangles with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No pairs left to form triangles with Node 7.

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph. [11]
