Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

- Node 0:
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 2, 5>
  - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>
  - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 5>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
