Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
