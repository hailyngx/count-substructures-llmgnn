Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
[4]

Explanation:
- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

No other nodes can form triangles in this graph.

Therefore, there are 1 triangle in the given graph, and the unique triangle is <4, 5, 7>. The final answer is [1].
