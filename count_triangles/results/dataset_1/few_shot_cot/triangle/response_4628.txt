Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
