Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
