Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with node 1, as it is greater than 0.
    * Skip any pairs with node 2, as it is greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 2 and 0, as they are greater than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with node 3, as it is not connected to any other node.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1, as they are greater than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with node 3, as it is not connected to any other node.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Since node 3 is not connected to any other node, no triangles can be formed with node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are greater than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are greater than 5.
    * Skip any pairs with node 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are greater than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Both 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are greater than 7.
    * Skip any pairs with node 3 as it is not connected to any other node.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are greater than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are greater than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
