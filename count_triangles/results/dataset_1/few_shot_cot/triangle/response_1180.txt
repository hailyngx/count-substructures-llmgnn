Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip every pair as there is no node greater than 3 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip every pair as there is no node greater than 4 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 4, as it is smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip every pair as there is no node greater than 6 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip every pair as there are no nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip every pair as there is no node greater than 8 to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
