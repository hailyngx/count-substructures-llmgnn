Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

As for the unique triangles found, based on the calculations above, we have:
[<4, 7, 9>]

Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets, is:
[2]
