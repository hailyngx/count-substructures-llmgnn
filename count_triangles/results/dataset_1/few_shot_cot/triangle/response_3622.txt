Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 5 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 4 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
