Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
