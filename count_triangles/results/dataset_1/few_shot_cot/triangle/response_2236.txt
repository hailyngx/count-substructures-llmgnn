Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial explanation, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Following the same logic as before, we evaluate each node for possible triangles. The count comes out to be 0 for each of these nodes as the remaining pairs do not form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
