Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
