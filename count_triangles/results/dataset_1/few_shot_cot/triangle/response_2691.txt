Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not a pair of 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No edges connected to Node 7, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
