Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors and connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
