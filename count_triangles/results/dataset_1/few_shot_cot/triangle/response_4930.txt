Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
        * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
        * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
        * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
        * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 9: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
        * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and also directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and also directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [6] 

Let me know if a different format is needed.
