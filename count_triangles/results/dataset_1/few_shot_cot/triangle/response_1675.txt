Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
