Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
