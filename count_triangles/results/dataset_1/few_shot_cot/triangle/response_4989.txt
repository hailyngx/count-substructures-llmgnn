1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 6) -> Both 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [6].
