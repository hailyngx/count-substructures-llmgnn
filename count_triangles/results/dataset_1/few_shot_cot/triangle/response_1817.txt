Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) - No triangle formed as 8 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - Triangle formed as 4 and 6 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) - Triangle formed as 3 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed as 3 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
