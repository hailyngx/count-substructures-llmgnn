Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
