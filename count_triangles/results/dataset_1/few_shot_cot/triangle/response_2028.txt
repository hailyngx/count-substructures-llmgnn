Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not a triangle as they are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No possible triangle involving Node 7 due to a lack of connected neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No possible triangle involving Node 9 due to a lack of connected neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3 triangles] in the given graph: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>.
