Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 2, 4, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 2, 6, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 because 2, 8, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 4, 6, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 because 4, 8, and 0 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 6, 8, and 0 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Does not form a triangle because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 4, 3, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 4, 7, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 4, 8, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 because 7, 3, and 2 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 because 7, 8, and 2 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Does not form a triangle because 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 4, 7, and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 because 4, 8, and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 6, 7, and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 6, 8, and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 because 7, 8, and 3 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) -> Does not form a triangle because 5 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 6, 7, and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 because 6, 8, and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 because 7, 8, and 4 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Does not form a triangle because 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 1) -> Does not form a triangle because 4 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> Does not form a triangle because 6 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

As the rest of the nodes have no triangles, we can stop the process at this point.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 5 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 19

Therefore, there are 19 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>]
