Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <1, 6, 8>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 1:
    - Same triangles counted with Node 0, so no new triangles counted for Node 1
    
- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 6, 9>.
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <3, 7, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
- Node 3:
    - Same triangles counted with Node 2, so no new triangles counted for Node 3
    
- Node 4:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    
- Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs that form triangles.
    
- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2: <2, 8, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <2, 3, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
- Node 8:
    - Same triangles counted with Node 0 and Node 6, so no new triangles counted for Node 8
    
- Node 9:
    - Same triangles counted with Node 2, Node 7, so no new triangles counted for Node 9

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
