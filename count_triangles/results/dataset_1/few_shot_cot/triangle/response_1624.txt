Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 0.
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is greater than 1.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 3.
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is greater than 5.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 6.
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (4, 6), but since 4 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        [triangles: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 3 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6]

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
        The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 5>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 7>.

        So, the final answer is: [6].
