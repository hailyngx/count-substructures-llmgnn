Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Partial pair (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Partial pair (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No complete triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles to form with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 0 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 9>]
