Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not form any triangles as the condition of having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle is not met.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
