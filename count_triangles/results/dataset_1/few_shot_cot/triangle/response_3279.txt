Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with these nodes.
    * Total triangles with each of these nodes as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 4>, <4, 3, 8>]
