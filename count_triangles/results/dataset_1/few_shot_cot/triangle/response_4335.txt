Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 3) and (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 4) and (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 5) and (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (5, 7) and (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pair to form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (0, 9) and (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (0, 9) and (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
