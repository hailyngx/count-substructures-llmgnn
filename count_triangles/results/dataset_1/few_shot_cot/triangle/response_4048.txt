Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <7, 8, 9>.
