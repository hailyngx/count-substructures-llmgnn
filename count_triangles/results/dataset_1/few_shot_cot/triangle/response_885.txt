Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be considered as the other nodes linked to Node 2 are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered as there are no other nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No pairs can be considered as they are the largest numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: 0 for each

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
