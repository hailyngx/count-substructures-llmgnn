Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> Both 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

        * Node 9:
            * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
