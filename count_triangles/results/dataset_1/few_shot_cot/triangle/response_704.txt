Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with greater nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with greater nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors present. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with greater nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected, not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected, not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
