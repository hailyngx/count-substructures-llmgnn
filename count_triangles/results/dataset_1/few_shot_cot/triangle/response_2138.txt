Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 2. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 2, 4, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
