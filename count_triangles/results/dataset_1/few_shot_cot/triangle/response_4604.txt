Response:
Following the step-by-step method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Not enough distinct nodes to form a triangle as they are the two largest nodes in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
