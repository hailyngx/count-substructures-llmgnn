Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed between 2, 4.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed between 2, 5.
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed between 2, 6.
    - Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed between 2, 8.
    - Pair 5: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed between 2, 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles as there are no pairs to form triangles involving Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - No possible triangles as the other nodes (0, 1) are smaller than Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No possible triangles involving Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 4: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 5: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 6: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 8: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Pair 9: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 6

- Node 7:
    - No possible triangles as the other nodes (1, 2, 6) are smaller than Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangles as the other nodes (0, 3, 5) are smaller than Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangles as the other node 6 is smaller than Node 9.

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 6 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [8].
