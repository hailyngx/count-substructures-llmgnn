Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs since none of the other nodes are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs since none of the other nodes are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (0, 3) and (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected as there is no edge (0, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (5, 4) and (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (9, 7) and (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (9, 7) and (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9)
* [Total number of triangles in the given graph: 4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
