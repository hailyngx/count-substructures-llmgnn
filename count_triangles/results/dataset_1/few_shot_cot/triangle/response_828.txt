Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example with the provided graph: 

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected as (1, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * No pairs to consider.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>.

        The final answer is [4].
