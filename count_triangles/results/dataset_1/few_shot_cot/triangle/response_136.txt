Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process similar to the example provided earlier and counting the triangles one node at a time:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No pairs to consider for Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider for Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
