Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - No triangles can be formed as node 0 does not have any neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - No triangles can be formed as node 2 does not have any neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
    - No additional triangles can be formed as we have already considered them in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - No additional triangles can be formed as we have already considered them in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - No additional triangles can be formed as we have already considered them in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    - No triangles can be formed as node 8 does not have at least 2 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - No additional triangles can be formed as we have already considered them in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
