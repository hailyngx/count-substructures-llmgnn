Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected (3, 8) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected (2, 5) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected (4, 9) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs where the other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs where the other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected (7, 9) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs where the other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
