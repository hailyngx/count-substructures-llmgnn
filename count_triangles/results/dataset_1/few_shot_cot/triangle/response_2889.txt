Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph by calculating the number of triangles each node is involved in:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Triangle formed: 0, 1, 4
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed: 1, 3, 5
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Triangle formed: 3, 4, 7
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Triangle formed: 4, 5, 9
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Triangle formed: 5, 6, 7
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
