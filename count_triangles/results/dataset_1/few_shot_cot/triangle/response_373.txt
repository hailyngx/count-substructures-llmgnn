Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Node 0:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. **Node 1:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node:
        - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.  
        -> Total triangles: 1  
        -> Unique triangles: <1, 7, 8>

3. **Node 2:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node:
        - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.  
        -> Total triangles: 1  
        -> Unique triangles: <3, 5, 8>

5. **Node 4:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node:
        - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.  
        -> Total triangles: 1  
        -> Unique triangles: <4, 5, 6>

6. **Node 5:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node:
        - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        -> Total triangles: 0

7. **Node 6:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**  
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3] (1 from node 1, 1 from node 3, and 1 from node 4), and the unique triangles found are <1, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 6>.
