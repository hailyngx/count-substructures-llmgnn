Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 1.
  * No triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3: No triangles involving Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4: No triangles involving Node 4 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles involving Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
  * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 6.
  * No triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than Node 7.
  * No triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
