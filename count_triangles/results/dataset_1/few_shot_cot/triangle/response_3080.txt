Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are also directly connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and forms a triangle.
        * Searching for possible triangles with (2, 5) as sides: 
            - (2, 5, 8) -> 2, 5, and 8 form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. They are also directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Now, we need to find a third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of 6 and forms a triangle.
        * Searching for possible triangles with (8, 9) as sides: 
            - (8, 9, 0) -> 8, 9, and 0 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
