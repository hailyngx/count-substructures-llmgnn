Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
