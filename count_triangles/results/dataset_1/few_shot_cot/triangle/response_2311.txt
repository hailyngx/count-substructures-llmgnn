Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed <6, 1, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
