Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the new graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1. But, 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

There are no triangles possible with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [5].
