Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <1, 2, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
