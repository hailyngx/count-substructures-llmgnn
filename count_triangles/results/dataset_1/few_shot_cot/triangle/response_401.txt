Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected as (0, 9) in the edge list. No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
