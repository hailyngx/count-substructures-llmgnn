Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider with Node 5, so no triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider, so no triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider, so no triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 3, 7>, <6, 8, 9>]
