Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3)

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 4 are not directly connected (no edge between them). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
