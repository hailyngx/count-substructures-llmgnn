Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
