Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed as both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed as both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed as both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed as both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed as both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>.
