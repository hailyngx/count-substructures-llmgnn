Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and identifying the triangles it forms.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair (2, 6) and (2, 7) as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair (0, 7) as it involves smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
