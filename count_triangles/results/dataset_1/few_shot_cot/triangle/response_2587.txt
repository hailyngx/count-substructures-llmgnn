Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs possible for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs possible for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs possible for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs possible for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs possible for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs possible for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
