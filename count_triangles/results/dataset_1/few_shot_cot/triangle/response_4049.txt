Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9).
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
