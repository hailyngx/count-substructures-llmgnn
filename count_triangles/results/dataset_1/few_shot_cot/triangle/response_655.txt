Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than any of them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 8, 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
