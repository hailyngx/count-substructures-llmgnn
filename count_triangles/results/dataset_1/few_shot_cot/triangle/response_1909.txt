Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
   * No other pairs involving Node 1 available to form triangles.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (3, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, or 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs available involving Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs available involving Node 6 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
