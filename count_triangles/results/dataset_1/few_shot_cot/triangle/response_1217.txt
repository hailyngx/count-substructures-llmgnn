Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by considering each node and its 1-hop neighbors:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> Node 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and there is a self-loop. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected together. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected together. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> Node 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, and there is a self-loop. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected together. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected together. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
