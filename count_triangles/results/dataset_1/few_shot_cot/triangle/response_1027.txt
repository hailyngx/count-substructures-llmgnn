Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * This node does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * This node does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
