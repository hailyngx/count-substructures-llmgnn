Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
        
        The final answer is [1].
