Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No edge between 2 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No edge between 3 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> No edge between 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> No edge between 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

I will continue this process for the rest of the nodes to find the total number of triangles. Let's proceed step by step.
