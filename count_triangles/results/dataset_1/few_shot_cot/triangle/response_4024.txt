Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as before, we will now count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we can consider is (8, 9) but since 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no neighbors to form pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
