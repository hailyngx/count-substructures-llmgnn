Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above to count the triangles in the provided graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors larger than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors larger than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors larger than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 7, 1>, <2, 3, 4>]
