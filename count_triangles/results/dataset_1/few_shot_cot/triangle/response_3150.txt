Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> These nodes are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 since it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> These nodes are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> These nodes are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> These nodes are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [6].
