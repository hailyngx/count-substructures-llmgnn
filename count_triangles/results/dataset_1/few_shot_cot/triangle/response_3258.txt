Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 3 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
