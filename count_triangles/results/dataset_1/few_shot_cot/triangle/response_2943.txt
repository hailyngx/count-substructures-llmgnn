Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 6.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with node 4 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Triangle formed with node 3 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 4), but since 2 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
