Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 3, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
