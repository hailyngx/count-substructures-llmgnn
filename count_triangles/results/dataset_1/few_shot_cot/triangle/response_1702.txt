Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 11: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 12: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2. No possible triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 3. No possible triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4. No possible triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5. No possible triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7. No possible triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8. No possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9. No possible triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 7 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
