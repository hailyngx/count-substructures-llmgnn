Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least two other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
