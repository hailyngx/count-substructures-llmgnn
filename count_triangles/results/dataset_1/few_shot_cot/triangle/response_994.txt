Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
