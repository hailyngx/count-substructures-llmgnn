Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs with 1 as the smallest numbered node lead to triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No pairs with 2 as the smallest numbered node lead to triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No pairs with 3 as the smallest numbered node lead to triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No pairs with 4 as the smallest numbered node lead to triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No pairs with 6 as the smallest numbered node lead to triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
