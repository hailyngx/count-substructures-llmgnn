Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as there are no nodes greater than 0 in this graph.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair that can form a triangle is (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<4, 8, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>]
