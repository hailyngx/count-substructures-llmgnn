Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skipped as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
  * Skipped, as all possible pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skipped, as it cannot form a triangle with any other node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skipped pairs with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped, as they cannot form a triangle with any other node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
