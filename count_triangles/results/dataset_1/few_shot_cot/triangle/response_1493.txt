Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

1. Node 0:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip because there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
