Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach used in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 9>

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 6, 7>

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.
* Unique triangles: <4, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
