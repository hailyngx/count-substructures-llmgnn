1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 0.

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    - Unique triangles for Node 1: <5, 6, 7>

- Node 2:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    - Unique triangles for Node 5: <4, 5, 9> and <5, 8, 9>

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles for Node 6: <6, 7, 8>

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    - Unique triangles for Node 7: <7, 8, 9>

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
