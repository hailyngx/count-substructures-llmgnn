Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. 
  * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t any pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
