Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.

Therefore, the triangles found in the given graph are:
[<1, 6, 7>]

So, the number of triangles in this graph is [1].
