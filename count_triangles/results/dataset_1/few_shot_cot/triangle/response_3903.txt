Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs remaining to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Remaining Nodes (5, 7, 8, 9):
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 larger neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
