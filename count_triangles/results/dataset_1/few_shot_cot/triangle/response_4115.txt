Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * The only neighbor of 0 that forms a triangle with Node 0 is 8. No other triangles are formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Does not form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to the absence of at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
