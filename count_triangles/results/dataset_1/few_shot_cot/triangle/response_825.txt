Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 0 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since there are no neighbors for Node 1, there won't be any triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (2, 5) and (6, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 2) and (7, 2) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * Since there is only one neighbor for Node 3, there won't be enough nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Since Node 4 has exactly 2 neighbors, any pair of its neighbors can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<4, 2, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 7, 9>)

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 9, 4>)

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Skip pairs including Node 8 as it is not a neighbor of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
