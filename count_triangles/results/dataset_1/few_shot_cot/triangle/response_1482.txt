Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. <4, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) - Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. <0, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. <1, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed. <2, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
[<4, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 9>] 

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
