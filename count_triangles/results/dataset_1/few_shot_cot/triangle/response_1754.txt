Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed starting from Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list (9, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <4, 6, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list (6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <5, 6, 9>)

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are <4, 6, 9> and <5, 6, 9>.
