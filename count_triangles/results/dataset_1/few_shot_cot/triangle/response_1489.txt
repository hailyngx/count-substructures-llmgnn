Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0 and Node 1).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No edges attached to Node 3, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, and 4). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, 1, and 4). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No edges attached to Node 8, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 1 and 4). No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
