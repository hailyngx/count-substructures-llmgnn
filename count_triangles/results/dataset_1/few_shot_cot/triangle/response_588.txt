Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Since Node 0 only has one 1-hop neighbor (Node 2), there are no triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as (3, 1, 4).
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 3, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as there are no pairs of nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
