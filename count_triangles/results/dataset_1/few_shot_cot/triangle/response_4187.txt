Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9: 
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.

Based on the calculations:

[There are 2 triangles in the given graph: <1, 5, 6> and <2, 5, 7>.]
