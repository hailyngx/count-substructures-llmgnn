Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's now count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed. 

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected. 
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed. 
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. 
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 5 are connected. 
    - Pair 2: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 7 are connected. 
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - None of these nodes have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
