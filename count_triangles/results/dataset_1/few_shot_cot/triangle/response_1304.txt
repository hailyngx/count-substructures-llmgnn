Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, 3, 6:
    * No triangles can be formed because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2, 3, or 6.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed that haven't been counted already.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 because neither 8 nor 9 is in the 1-hop neighbor set of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed that haven't been counted already.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>]
