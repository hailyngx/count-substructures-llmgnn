Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example given, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
            * Unique triangles formed with Node 0: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
            * Unique triangles formed with Node 1: <1, 3, 7>

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * No pairs with nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * No pairs with nodes greater than 4 to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
            * Unique triangles formed with Node 5: <5, 6, 7>

        * Node 6:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * No pairs with nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 8 and 9:
            * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
