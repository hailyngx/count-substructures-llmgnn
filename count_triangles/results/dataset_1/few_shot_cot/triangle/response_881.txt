Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is an isolated node, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 didn't form any triangles with other nodes due to size constraints.

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 didn't form any triangles with other nodes due to size constraints.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the final answer for the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
