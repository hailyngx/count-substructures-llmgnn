Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <4, 6, 7>
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <4, 6, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs that include Node 1 with greater numbered nodes.

3. Node 2:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs that include Node 2 with greater numbered nodes.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <4, 6, 7>
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <4, 6, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <5, 6, 7>
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 6, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

6. Node 5:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs that include Node 5 with greater numbered nodes.

7. Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 6, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 5, 6>
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs that include Node 8 with greater numbered nodes.

10. Node 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs that include Node 9 with greater numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
