Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example process outlined earlier, let's find all the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected. No third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 0 and is also connected to both 1 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 1 and is also connected to both 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 1 and is also connected to both 5 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No third node that is a 1-hop neighbor of Node 6 and is also connected to both 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing the triangles from all nodes:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
