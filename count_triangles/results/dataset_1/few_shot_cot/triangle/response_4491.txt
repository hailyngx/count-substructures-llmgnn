Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 8), but since 7 and 8 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
