Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
