Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs available as Node 2 can only form triangles with nodes greater than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip the remaining pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
