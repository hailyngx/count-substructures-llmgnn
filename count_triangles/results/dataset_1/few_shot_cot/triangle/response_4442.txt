Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
