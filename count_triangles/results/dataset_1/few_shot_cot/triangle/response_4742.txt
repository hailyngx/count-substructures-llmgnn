Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * 1. (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * 2. (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * 1. (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * 1. (0, 6) - Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * 1. (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 only have 1-hop neighbors that are smaller in number, so no triangles can be formed with these nodes individually.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
