Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 2 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pair involving Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 6 as it's smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs involving Node 4 as it's smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
