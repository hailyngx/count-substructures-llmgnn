Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
   * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
   * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
   * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
   * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
   * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
   * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
   * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
   * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
   * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
   * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
   * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
   * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
