Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2


* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 0


* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 1


* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 3).
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1


* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0


* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 0


* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0


* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0


* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
