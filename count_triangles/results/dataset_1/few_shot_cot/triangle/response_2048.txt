Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

  * Node 0:
      * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

  * Node 1:
      * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 3:
      * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
      * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 4:
      * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
      * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
      * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 5:
      * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
      * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 6:
      * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
      * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
  * Node 8 and Node 9:
      * Skipped because there are no other nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
