Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No additional triangles can be formed starting from node 7 as smaller neighbors have been covered.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed using node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed using node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up the triangles found for each node:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7 triangles] in the given graph.
