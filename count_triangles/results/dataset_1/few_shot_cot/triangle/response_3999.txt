Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Identifying the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2: No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3: No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4: 
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7: No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    - No other pairs with Nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    - No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<4, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>]
