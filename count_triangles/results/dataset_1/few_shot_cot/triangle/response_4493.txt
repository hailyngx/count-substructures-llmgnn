Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 0, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>]
