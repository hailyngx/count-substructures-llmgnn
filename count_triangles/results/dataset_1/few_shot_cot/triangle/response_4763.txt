Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

After checking the graph, the unique triangles are found to be <1, 9, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 1, 9>, <3, 1, 5>, <4, 9, 8>, <4, 9, 5>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 5, 1>.

Hence, the final answer is [9].
