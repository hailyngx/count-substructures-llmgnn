Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs possible for Node 2 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No more triangles can be formed using Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No more triangles can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs possible for Node 7 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No more triangles can be formed using Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed using Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
