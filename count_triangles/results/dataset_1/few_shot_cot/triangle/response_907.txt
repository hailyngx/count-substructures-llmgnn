Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the same procedure as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 2>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed <4, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed <4, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
