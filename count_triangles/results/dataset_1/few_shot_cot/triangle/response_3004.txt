Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 0 due to the limited number of connections.

* Node 1:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 1 due to the limited number of connections.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 5 due to the limited number of connections.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 7 due to the limited number of connections.

* Node 8:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 8 due to the limited number of connections.

* Node 9:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 9 due to the limited number of connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
