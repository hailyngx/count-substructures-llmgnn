Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph with the given nodes, edges, and adjacency lists:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) - Node 8 and Node 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) - Node 5 and Node 9 share a connection. No third node to complete the triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) - Node 7 and Node 3 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 4) - Node 6 and Node 4 are 1-hop neighbors and directly connected forming a triangle.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) - Node 6 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors, not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) - Node 6 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors and directly connected forming a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 1) - Node 9 and Node 1 are 1-hop neighbors but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
