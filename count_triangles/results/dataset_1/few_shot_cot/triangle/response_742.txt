Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 1 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 5 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 7 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 8 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9 as there aren't at least two nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
