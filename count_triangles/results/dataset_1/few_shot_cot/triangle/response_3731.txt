Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> <0, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> <1, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> <2, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The 1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 has only one node, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> <4, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> <5, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The 1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 has only two nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> <5, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
