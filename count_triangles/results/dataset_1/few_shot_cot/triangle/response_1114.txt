Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because neither (3, 6) nor (6, 3) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 3. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as it has no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8. 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
