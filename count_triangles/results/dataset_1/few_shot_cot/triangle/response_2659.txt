Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 4:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as there is no set of 3 mutually connected nodes.
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as there is no set of 3 mutually connected nodes.
* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there is no set of 3 mutually connected nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
[<2, 3, 8>, <3, 2, 9>, <7, 1, 8>]
