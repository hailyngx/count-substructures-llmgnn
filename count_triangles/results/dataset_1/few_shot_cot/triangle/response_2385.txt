Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
