Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

I will continue this process for each remaining node until all possible triangles are counted. Let's proceed.
