Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs lead to triangles, so Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 2 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs lead to triangles, so Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs lead to triangles, so Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 2) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 1 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 1) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs lead to triangles, so Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
