Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
