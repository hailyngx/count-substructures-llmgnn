Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by following the same method as the example provided. 

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

3. Node 2:
    - It does not form any triangle as there are no pairs to form triangles with.

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - It does not form any triangle as there are no pairs to form triangles with.

6. Node 5:
    - It does not form any triangle as there are no pairs to form triangles with.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - It does not form any triangle as there are no pairs to form triangles with.

10. Node 9:
    - It does not form any triangle as there are no pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
