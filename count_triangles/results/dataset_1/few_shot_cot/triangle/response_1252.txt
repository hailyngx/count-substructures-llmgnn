Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No unique triangles found directly with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6. No unique triangles found directly with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
