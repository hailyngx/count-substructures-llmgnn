Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 7>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes larger than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2
* Unique triangles in the graph: <3, 4, 7>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
