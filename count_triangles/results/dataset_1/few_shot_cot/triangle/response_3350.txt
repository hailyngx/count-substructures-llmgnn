Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No opportunity for forming triangles with the remaining edges.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other possibilities for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No more combinations to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other combinations possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more combinations to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
