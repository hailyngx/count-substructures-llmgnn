Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are directly connected. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
