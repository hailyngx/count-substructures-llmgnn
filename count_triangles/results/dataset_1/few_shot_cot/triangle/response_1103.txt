Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected even though they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between 6 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected as there is no edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) and (6, 8) are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with two nodes greater than 6.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
