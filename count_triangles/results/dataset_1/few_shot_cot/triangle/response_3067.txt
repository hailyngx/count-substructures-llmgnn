Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Skip any pair that doesn't form a triangle as shown below.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
