Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 6 isn't connected to Node 5. 
            * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
            * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
            * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
            
        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
            * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
            
        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
            
        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Does not form a triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
            
        * Node 4:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with.
        
        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
            
        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Does not form a triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
            
        * Node 7:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with.
        
        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.
        
        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with only 2 neighbors.
        
        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        [6]

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
