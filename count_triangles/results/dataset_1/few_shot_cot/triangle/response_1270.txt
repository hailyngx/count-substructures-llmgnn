Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as all possible pairs include nodes smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as all possible pairs include nodes smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as all possible pairs include nodes smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

Adding the total triangles from each node: 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
