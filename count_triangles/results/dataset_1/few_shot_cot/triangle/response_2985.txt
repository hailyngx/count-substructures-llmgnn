Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. Checking for the third node.
        * Possible triangle: <1, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. Checking for the third node.
        * Possible triangle: <4, 6, 7>
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
\[<1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>\]
