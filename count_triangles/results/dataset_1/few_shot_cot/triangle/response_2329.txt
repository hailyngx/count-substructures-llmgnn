Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the same steps as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
