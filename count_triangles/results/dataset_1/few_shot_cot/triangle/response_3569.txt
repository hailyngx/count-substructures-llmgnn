Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only two nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only two nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only two nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are only two nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
