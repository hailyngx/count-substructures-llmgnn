Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) <br>
    Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1 with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip Pair 2 with Node 7 because it has small number.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) <br>
    1-hop neighbors 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 having no larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) <br>
    1-hop neighbors 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 having no larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 having no larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) <br>
    1-hop neighbors 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 having no larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) <br>
    1-hop neighbors 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: <br>
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
