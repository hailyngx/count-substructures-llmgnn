Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

So the final answer is [3].
