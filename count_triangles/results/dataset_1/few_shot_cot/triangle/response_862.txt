Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}
