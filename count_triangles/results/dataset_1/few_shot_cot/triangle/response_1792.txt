Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 0 to form triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 3 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 4 to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
