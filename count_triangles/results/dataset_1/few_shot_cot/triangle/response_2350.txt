Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
