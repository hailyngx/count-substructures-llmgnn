Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 9.

* Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + ... = [Total Triangles]
    * Unique triangles found:
        <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>...
    
Therefore, the final answer is [Total Triangles].
