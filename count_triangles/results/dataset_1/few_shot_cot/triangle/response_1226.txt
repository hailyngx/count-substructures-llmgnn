Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process demonstrated in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 8, and 9:
    * No connections to form triangles with at least two other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
