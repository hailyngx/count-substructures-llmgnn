Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs available for Node 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle is possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs for Node 4, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 is directly connected to itself creating a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs for Node 7, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs for Node 8, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs for Node 9, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
