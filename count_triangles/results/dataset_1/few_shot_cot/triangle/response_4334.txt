Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Nodes 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Nodes 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Nodes 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Nodes 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Nodes 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
