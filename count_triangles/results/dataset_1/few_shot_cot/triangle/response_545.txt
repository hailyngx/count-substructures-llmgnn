Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
