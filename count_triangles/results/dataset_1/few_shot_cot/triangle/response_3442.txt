Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * No connections, so no triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 9:
        * No connections, so no triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
