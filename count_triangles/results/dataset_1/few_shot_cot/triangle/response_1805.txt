Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
