Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected according to the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there aren't at least two larger nodes for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
