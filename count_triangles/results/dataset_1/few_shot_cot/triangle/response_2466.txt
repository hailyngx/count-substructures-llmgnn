Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 1 are also connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs for forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
