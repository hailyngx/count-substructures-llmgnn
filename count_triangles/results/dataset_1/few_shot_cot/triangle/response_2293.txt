Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are a total of 6 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <6, 7, 8>]
