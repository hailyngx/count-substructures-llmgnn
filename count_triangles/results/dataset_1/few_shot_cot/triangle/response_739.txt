Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair containing nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also connected directly forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and also connected directly forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed as there is not at least 1 node greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there is no edge connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.  

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
