Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 7), but it's the same node. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
