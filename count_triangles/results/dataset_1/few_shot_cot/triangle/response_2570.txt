Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 1 in this subgraph.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 2 in this subgraph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 3 in this subgraph.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 4 in this subgraph.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 5 in this subgraph.  
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 6 in this subgraph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 7 in this subgraph. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
