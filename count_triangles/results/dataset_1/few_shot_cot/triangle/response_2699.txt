Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following similar steps as in the previous example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

        * Node 1:
            No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has no neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as all its neighbors are smaller.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as its neighbor is smaller.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
            * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            No new triangles can be formed with Node 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, [9] unique triangles are found in the given graph: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <5, 0, 6>, <6, 7, 9>.
