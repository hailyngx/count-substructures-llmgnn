Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
