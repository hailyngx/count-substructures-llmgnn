Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example, we will identify the triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors, so no triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

*Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
