Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as there is an edge (6, 8) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
