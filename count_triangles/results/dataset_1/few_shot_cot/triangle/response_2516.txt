Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected because there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
