Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as outlined previously, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0. <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0. <0, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1. <1, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1. <1, 2, 7>
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1. <1, 4, 7>
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1. <1, 4, 8>
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that involve nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3. <3, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that involve nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that involve nodes 1 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that involve nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
