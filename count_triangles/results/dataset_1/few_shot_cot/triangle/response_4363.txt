Response:
Following the steps described in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. However, 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. However, 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. However, 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. However, 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. However, 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. However, 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Only Node 7 is a 1-hop neighbor for Node 5, so no triangles can be formed with this configuration.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected. However, 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
