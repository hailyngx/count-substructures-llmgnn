Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest valued node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest valued node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest valued node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Node 5 doesn't form any triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest valued node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest valued node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as no pair can be formed with a larger node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4 

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 7> 
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Thus, the final answer is [4].
