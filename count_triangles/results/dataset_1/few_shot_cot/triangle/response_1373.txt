Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
