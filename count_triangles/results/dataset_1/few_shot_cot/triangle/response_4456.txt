Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Following the same process as above for each node:
        * Node 6: 0 triangles
        * Node 7: 2 triangles
        * Node 8: 0 triangles
        * Node 9: 1 triangle

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
