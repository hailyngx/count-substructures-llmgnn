Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
