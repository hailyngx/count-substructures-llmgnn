Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Starting with each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as (0, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as (0, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has only one 1-hop neighbor, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
