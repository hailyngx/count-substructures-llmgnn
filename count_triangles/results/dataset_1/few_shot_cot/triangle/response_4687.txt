Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 0.
            * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because they are not connected in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip all pairs since they involve Node 0 which is smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2. Any pairs involving Nodes 1 also skipped.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Pair 3: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3. Any pairs involving Nodes 2 also skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with. Move to the next node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Nodes 6 and 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6 and 7
            * No triangles formed with nodes 6 and 7.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 9. Any pairs involving Nodes 1 or 2 also skipped.
            * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 6 and 0 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        [Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7]

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
        
        The unique triangles found are: 
        <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 8, 5>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <8, 9, 6>.
