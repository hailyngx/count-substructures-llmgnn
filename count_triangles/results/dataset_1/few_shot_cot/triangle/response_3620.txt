Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles are formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
