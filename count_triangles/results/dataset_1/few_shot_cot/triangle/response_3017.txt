Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they have fewer than two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Adding up the triangles from each node:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
