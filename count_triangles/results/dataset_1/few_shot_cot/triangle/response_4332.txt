Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 4. Triangle <0, 1, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7. Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7. Triangle <3, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7. Triangle <4, 1, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
