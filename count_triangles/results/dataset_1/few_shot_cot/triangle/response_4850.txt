Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    - The adjacency list for Node 1 only contains one neighbor, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as one of the nodes.

* Node 2:
    - The adjacency list for Node 2 only contains one neighbor, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as one of the nodes.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - The adjacency list for Node 8 only contains two neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 8 as one of the nodes.

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
