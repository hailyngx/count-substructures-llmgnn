Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected. No additional triangles are formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected. No additional triangles are formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected. No additional triangles are formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected. No additional triangles are formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected. No additional triangles are formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
