Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
  * Skip all pairs as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.

- Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) = 7
[7] 

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
