Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Node 0 since it is smaller than 1. No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs that involve Node 1 since it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No edges connected to Node 5. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 7), but since 3 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No edges connected to Node 8. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
