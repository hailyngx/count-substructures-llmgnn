Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share a common neighbor. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11. 

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
