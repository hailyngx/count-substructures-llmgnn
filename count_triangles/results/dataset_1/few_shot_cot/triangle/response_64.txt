Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
