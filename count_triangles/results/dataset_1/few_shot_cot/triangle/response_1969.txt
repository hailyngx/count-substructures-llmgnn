Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 3.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - The only pair we could consider is (7, 4), but since both are smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 8.
    - No other pairs left to form triangles with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - The only pair we could consider is (9, 8), but 9 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Others) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
