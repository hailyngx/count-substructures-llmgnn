Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and there is an edge between them (5, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and there is an edge between them (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and there is an edge between them (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and there is an edge between them (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [4].
