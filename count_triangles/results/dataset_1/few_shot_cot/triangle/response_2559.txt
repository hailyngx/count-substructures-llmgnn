Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 1, and 4
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle
        * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle
        * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle
        * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle
        * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 4, and 9
        * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> No triangle
        * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle
        * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> No triangle
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
    * Node 1:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 2:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 3, 4, and 9
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
    * Node 4:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 5:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 6:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 8:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 9:
        * Skip all pairs as other nodes are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
