Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form any triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
