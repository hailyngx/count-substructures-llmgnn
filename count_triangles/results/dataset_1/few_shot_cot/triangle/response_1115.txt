Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
