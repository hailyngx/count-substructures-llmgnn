Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the process from the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes smaller than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
