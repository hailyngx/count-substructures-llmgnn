Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 are not connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 to 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>]
