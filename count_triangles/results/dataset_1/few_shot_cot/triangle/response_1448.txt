Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles step-by-step for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no connections higher than 2.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no connections higher than 3.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no connections higher than 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no connections higher than 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
