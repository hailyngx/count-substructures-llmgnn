Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
