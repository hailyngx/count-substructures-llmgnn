Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by applying the step-by-step method as we did in the previous example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 3:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 5:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 8.

    Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
