Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider as they all involve nodes smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider as they both involve nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
