Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example to count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Since there are no two nodes greater than 8 or 9, no triangles can be formed starting from these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>]
