Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
