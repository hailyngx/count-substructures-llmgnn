Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example, we will now determine the number of triangles in the graph provided.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 3 are also directly connected as (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 2) and (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No node to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No node to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No node to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with 8 or 9.

Count of triangles formed from each smallest numbered node:
0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
