Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1 (0). No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 (already smaller than 2).
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as there is only 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4 (0, 1, 2). No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5 (already covered).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 (already smaller than 6).
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 (already smaller than 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there is only 1 node left in the graph.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
