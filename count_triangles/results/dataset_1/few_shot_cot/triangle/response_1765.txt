Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with this node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 5 as it is smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Cannot form a triangle as there are no other nodes connected to them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
