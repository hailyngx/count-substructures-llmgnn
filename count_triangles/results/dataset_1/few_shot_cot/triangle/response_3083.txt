Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
        * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
