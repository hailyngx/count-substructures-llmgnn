Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
