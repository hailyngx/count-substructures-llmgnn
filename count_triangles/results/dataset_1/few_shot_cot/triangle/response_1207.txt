Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Continue this process for Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
