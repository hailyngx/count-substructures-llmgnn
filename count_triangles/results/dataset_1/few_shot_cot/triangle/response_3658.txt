Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
