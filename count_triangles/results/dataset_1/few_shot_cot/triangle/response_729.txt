Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph using the step-by-step approach:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 since 3, 4, and 0 are all connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 since 0, 3, and 4 are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 since 4, 6, and 9 are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all possible pairs as Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all possible pairs as Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the found triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [3]
* Unique triangles in the graph: <0, 3, 4>.
