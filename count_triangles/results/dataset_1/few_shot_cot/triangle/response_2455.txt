Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 1 are also connected as (3, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are also connected as (7, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
