Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Both 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
    - No more pairs to consider for Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 unique triangles in the given graph: <4, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 0>.

Finally, the answer is [3].
