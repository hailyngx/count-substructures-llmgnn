Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. **Node 2:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1).
   - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 2, and 3).
   - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 2, 3, and 4).
   - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 2, 3, 4, and 6).
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
   - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (2, 6, and 7).
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
