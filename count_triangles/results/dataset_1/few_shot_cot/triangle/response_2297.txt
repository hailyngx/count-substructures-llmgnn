Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's go ahead and find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3, 4, 5:
  * Follow the same process as above to calculate the total number of triangles with each as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + X (Node 3) + Y (Node 4) + Z (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = Total Triangles
