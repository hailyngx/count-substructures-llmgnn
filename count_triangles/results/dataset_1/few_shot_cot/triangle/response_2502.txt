Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
