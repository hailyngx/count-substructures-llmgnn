Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach demonstrated in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
