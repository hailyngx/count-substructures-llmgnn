Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <0, 3, 4>
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle with Node 4 already counted from Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5: <1, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * See Node 0 and Node 1 for pairs already evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle with Node 5 already counted from Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * See Node 0, Node 1, and Node 3 for pairs already evaluated.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with the limited connections to other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Triangle with Node 2 already counted from Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with the limited connections to other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
