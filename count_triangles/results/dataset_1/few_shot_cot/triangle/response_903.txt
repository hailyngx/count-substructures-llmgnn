Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, so no triangle is formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5, so no triangle is formed.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has only one neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 8 has limited neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9, so no triangle is formed.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
