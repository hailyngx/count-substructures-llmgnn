Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no larger nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
