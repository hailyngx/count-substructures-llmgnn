Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the process for counting triangles step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are both smaller than 2, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 5), but since 8 is smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>.

So, the final answer is [9].
