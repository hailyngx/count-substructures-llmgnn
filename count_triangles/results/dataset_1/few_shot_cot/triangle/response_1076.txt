Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    - Pair 6: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 onwards as they are smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. 
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs as no node greater than 8 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs as no node greater than 9 to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Adding up the total triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
