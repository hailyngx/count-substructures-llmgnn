1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it has a smaller number.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs of 1 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs of 2 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs of 3 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs of 4 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs of 5 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs of 6 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs of 7 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs of 8 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs of 9 can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
