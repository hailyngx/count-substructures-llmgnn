Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - Form a triangle with Node 5 since they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Form a triangle with Node 4 since they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Form a triangle with Node 5 since they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - Form a triangle with Node 7 since they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Form a triangle with Node 7 since they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
