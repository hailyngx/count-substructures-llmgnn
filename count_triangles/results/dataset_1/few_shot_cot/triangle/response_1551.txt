Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
