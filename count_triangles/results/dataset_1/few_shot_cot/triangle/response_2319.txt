Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to complete the triangle.
        - (8, 9) are 1-hop neighbors of each other, completing the triangle <1, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) - 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to complete the triangle.
        - (0, 9) are 1-hop neighbors of each other, completing the triangle <0, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to complete the triangle.
        - (0, 6) are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Checking for the third node to complete the triangle.
        - (1, 9) are 1-hop neighbors of each other, completing the triangle <1, 8, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 3, 9>, <1, 8, 9>]
