Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them for forming triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as there is no combination of 2 other nodes that have direct connections to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as there is no combination of 2 other nodes that have direct connections to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected even though they are both 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
