Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there is only one edge connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 4, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4>]
