Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Direct edge exists. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - Direct edge exists. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - Direct edge exists. Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped both as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Output: [3]
