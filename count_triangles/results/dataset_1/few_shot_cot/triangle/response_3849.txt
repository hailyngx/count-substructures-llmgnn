Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 6: <0, 2, 4>
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4: <0, 2, 6>
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 3: <0, 2, 8>
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 11: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 12: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 13: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 14: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 15: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0: <0, 4, 6>
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Skipping nodes 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
