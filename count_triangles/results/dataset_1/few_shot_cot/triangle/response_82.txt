Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but (4, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as there are no nodes greater than 2 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, but (5, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 5, but (9, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, but (9, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The answer is [2].
