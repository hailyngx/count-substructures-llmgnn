Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
