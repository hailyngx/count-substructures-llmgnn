Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs available as 0 has no other 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs available as 1 has no other 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more suitable pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No suitable pairs available as 3 has no 1-hop neighbor greater than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 0, as it is smaller than 4.
    * No suitable pairs available as 4 has no 1-hop neighbor greater than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 1, 3, and 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * No suitable pairs available as 5 has no 1-hop neighbor greater than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more suitable pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors available for 7 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more suitable pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more suitable pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
