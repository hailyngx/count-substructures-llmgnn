Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipping all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs involving Nodes 0, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping all pairs involving Nodes 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as both nodes don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
