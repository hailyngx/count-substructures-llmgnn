Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the approach shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 3, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no neighbors of Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 are either smaller or not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as both 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 are smaller and not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
