Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> both are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> both are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> both are 1-hop neighbors, but not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> both are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> both are 1-hop neighbors, but not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> both are 1-hop neighbors and connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
