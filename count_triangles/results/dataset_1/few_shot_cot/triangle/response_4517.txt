Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed since 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
