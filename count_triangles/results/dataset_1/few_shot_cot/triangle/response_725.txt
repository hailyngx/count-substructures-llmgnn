Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, and 8:
    * Skipped because they only have 1 or fewer nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
