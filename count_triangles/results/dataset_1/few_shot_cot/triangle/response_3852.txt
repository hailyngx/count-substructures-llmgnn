Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle <0, 5, 8>.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle <0, 5, 9>.
    - Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it only has Node 9 as a neighbor.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 due to lack of interconnected neighbors.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it only has Node 4 as a neighbor.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it only has Node 0 and Node 3 as neighbors.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has Node 7, 8, and 9 as neighbors but they are not interconnected.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 due to no neighbors.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it only has Node 5 as a neighbor.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as neighbors but they are not interconnected.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as neighbors but they are not interconnected.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
