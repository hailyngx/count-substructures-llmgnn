Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
