Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's begin the process of counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [ <0, 6, 7> ]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [ <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9> ]

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [ <2, 3, 7> ]

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no pairs of nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
