Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <1, 7, 9>)

* Node 2:
    * Skipping any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <2, 3, 5>)

* Node 3:
    * Skipping any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipping a pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (Triangles <2, 3, 6> and <3, 5, 6>)

* Node 7:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
