Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (3, 6) and (3, 8). Two triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (8, 9) and (9, 8). Two triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped because they don't have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 8), but since 1 and 8 are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (8, 9) and (9, 8). Two triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
