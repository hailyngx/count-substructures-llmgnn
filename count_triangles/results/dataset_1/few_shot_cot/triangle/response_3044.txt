Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, I will proceed to count the triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2. 
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected. (4, 5) forms a triangle with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected forming a triangle with 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
