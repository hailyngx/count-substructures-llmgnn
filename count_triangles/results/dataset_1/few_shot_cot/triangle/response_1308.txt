Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Node 0:
* Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 1:
No edges connected to Node 1. No triangles can be formed.

Node 2:
* Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
* Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Node 3:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
* Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
* Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
* Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Node 4:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
* No triangles can be formed given the available edges.

Node 5:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
* No triangles can be formed given the available edges.

Node 6:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
* Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Node 7:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
* No triangles can be formed given the available edges.

Node 8:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
* Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
* The rest of the pairs with Node 8 are the same as previously calculated with Node 3, hence no new triangles.

Node 9:
* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
* No triangles can be formed given the available edges.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
