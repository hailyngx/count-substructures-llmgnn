Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Skip any pair that does not have a common neighbor between Node 1 and the other node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 9:
    * These nodes do not have enough higher-numbered neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<4, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>
<0, 4, 5>
