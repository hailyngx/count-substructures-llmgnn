Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (0, 9) and (4, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the neighbor and edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8:
  * These nodes have no neighbors or are smaller than the smallest neighbor, so no triangles can be formed involving them.

* Node 9:
  * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
