Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 6) = 7.
