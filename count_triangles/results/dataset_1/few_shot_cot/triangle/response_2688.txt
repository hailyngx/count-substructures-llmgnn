Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has only one neighbor.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has only three neighbors.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
\[<1, 4, 7>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 9>\]
