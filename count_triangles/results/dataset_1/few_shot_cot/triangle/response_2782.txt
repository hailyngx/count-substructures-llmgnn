Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
