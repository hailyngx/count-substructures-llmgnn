Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are connected, and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
