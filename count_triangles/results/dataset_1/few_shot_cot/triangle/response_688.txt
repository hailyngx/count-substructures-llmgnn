Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (4, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
