Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle <3, 4, 6> formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Triangle <3, 6, 9> formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle <4, 6, 7> formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle <4, 6, 8> formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Triangle <4, 6, 9> formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves, we skip calculating their triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
