Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not connected as (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are no edges connected to Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 5 and 9 are not connected as (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
