Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
   * Skip all pairs due to smaller nodes.
   * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
   * Skip all pairs involving Node 0.
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
   * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs due to smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
