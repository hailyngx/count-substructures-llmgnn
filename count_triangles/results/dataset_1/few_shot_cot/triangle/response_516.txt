Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as detailed in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 does not have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 has only 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has only 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 has only 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has only 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has only 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
