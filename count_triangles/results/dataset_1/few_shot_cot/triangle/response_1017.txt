Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the provided graph and adjacency list, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node's relationships:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) does not exist in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5 as there aren't any.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [3].
