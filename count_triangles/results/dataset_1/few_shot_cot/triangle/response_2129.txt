Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected as there is no edge (1, 2) in the list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected as there is no edge (1, 4) in the list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not connected as there is no edge (1, 6) in the list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors for Node 3, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no neighbors for Nodes 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>]
