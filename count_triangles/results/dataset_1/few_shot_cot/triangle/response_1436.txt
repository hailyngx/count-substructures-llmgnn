Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 7>
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
