Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes 1 and higher.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed that include nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (1, 9) and (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (2, 9) and (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (6, 9) and (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
