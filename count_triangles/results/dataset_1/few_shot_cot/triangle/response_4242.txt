Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 6 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
