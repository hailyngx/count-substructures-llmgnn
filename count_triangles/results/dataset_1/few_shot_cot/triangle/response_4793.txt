Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No connections, so no triangles possible.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 8>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Triangle formed: <6, 8, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or 4 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with just these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
