Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process explained in the example above, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No pairs can be formed with Node 1 as it has no neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has no neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 6: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 2, 4, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 4 or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
