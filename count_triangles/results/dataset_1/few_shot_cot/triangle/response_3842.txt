Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same approach as explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles possible with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as there are no edges connected to it.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 3 as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
