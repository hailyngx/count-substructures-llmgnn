Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> 4 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 is connected to itself. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 3, so no triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 4, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 8, 8>]
