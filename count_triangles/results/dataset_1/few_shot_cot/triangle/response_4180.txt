Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process of counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
