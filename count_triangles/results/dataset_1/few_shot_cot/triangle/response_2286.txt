Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the provided adjacency list and edge list, we will count the triangles in the graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, as both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, as both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6, as both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8, as both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
  - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4, as both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8, as both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
