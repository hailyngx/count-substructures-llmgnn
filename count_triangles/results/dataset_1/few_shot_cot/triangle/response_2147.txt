Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7 and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
