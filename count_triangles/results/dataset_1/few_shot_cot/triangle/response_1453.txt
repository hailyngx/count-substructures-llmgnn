Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Skip the analysis for Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2, and continue with Node 2:

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 4 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip analysis for Node 0 and Node 2 as they are smaller, consider next possible pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip analysis for previously checked nodes and move to next pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
