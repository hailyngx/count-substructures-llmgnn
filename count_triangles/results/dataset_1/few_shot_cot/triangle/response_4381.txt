Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node (<0, 2, 4>).
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node (<0, 2, 6>).
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node (<0, 4, 6>).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are not enough nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node (<2, 5, 6>).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node (<3, 5, 6>).
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node (<3, 5, 7>).
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node (<3, 6, 7>).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are not enough nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - Forms a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node (<8, 9, 3>).
    * Total triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 8) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
