Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> Both 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
