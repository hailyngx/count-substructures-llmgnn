Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 8 are directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles found: <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 9>

* Node 7:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No neighbors to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 6 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles found: <3, 6, 9>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
