Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example above, we will count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip the pairs involving smaller nodes than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pairs involving smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs involving smaller nodes than 3.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve at least one smaller node than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve at least one smaller node than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve at least one smaller node than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs involving smaller nodes than 7.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Therefore, we will output the final answer in the following format: \[total_triangles\].

\[6\]
