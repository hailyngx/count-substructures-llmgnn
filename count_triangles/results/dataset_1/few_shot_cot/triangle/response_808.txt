Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
  * These nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, so we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
