Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these remaining nodes as there are not enough nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
