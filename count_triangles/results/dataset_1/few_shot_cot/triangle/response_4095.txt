1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's go ahead and count the number of triangles in the given graph by analyzing each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the graph. 
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 2 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    Skip pairs that include Node 1.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 3 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 4 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    Skip pairs that include Node 1.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 5 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 6 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    Skip pairs that include Node 1.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it needs at least 2 other nodes that are greater than 7 to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    Skip pairs that include Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected in the graph. 
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    Skip pairs that include Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected in the graph. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected in the graph. 
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, [6] triangles are there in the given graph.
