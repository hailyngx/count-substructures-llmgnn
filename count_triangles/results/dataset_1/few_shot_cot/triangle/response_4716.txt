Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles are possible for Node 2 in this case.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles are possible for Node 3 in this case.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles are possible for Node 4 in this case.

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * Skip these nodes as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles are possible for Node 9 in this case.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [2].
