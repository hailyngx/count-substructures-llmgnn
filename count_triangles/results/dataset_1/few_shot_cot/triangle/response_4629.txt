Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with it.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with it.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 2 are directly connected as (8, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 8, and 9:
    * Since these nodes have no triangles among themselves or with any other nodes, they do not contribute to the total count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
