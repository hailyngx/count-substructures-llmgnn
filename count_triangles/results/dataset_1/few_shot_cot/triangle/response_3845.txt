Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    No edges connected to Node 5, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No further triangles possible for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No edges connected to Node 9, so no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
