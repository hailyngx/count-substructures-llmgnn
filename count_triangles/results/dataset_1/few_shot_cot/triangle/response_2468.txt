Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph you've described:

    1. Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    2. Node 1:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    3. Node 2:
        * Skip pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    4. Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    5. Node 4:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    6. Node 5:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    7. Node 6:
        * Skip pairs with Node 0.
        No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    8. Node 7:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    9. Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    10. Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5]. The unique triangles found are <2, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, and <3, 6, 9>.
