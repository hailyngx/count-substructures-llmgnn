Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not directly connected.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed as 3 is connected to both 0 and 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No possible triangles involving Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
  * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed as 4 is connected to both 3 and 7.
  * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No possible triangles involving Node 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller numbered nodes.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 have no triangles as they don't have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
