Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
