Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 or 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = [4].

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
