Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
