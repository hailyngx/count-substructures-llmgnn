Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Final answer: [1]
