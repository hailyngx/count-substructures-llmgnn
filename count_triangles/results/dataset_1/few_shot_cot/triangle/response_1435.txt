Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
