Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the earlier example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 8)
Therefore, the final answer is [1].

The triangle found: <2, 3, 8>.
