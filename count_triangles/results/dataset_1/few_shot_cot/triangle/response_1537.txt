Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edges list.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edges list.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 1>]
