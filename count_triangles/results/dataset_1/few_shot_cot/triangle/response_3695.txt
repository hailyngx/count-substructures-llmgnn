Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (1, 4) as 4 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes (1, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
