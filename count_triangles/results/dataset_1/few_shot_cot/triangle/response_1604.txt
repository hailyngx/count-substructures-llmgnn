Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <3, 5, 2>

* Node 3:
    * No triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2)
* Final Answer: [1]
* Unique triangles: <3, 5, 2>

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <3, 5, 2>.
