Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
