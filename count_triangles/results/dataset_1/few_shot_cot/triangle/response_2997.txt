Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * These nodes do not have at least 2 other nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
All unique triangles found:
<2, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <4, 6, 9>.
