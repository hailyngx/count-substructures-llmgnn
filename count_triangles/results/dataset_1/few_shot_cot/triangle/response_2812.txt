Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with (1, 4, 0)
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed with (1, 7, 0)
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected but not with 0. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with (4, 7, 0)
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with (6, 7, 0)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with (4, 5, 1)
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with (4, 7, 1)
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with (5, 7, 1)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with (4, 5, 2)
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with (4, 9, 2)
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with (5, 9, 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
