Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one edge connected to this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one edge connected to each neighboring node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected, but not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle as there is only one edge connected to each neighboring node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
