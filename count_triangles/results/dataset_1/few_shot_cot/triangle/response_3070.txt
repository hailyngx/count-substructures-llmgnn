Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1 for triangle calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2 for triangle calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3 for triangle calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. No third node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since there are no pairs with larger nodes for these nodes, there are no triangles involving them.

Finally, we calculate the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 0.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
