Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has only one neighbor, there are no triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and move to the next nodes: 7, 4, 2, and then, 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and move to the next nodes: 5, 6, 7, and then, 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other since there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes, but no other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and move to the next nodes: 7 and then, 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes and move to the next nodes: 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 9 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The only pair to consider is (9, 4), but since 9 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with that are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
