Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the approach shown in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also connected as (7, 1) and (1, 8) exist in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as the pairs with its 1-hop neighbors have been covered when considering larger nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as the pairs with its 1-hop neighbors have been covered when considering larger nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.
  
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
