Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2, which are smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 1. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1, which are smaller than 2.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 2. Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3, which are smaller than 4.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 4. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2, which are smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 5. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, which are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6, which are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7, which are smaller than 8.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 8. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8, which are smaller than 9.
    - No other pairs to consider for Node 9. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, let's calculate the total triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, [there are 4 triangles in the given graph].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<7, 3, 8>
