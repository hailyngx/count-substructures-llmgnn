Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are: 
[<7, 9, 0>, <3, 6, 1>].
