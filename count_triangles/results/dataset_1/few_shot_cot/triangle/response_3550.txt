Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with 1 as the smallest numbered node as it does not share edges with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with 3 as the smallest numbered node as it does not share edges with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with 4 as the smallest numbered node as it does not share edges with any other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
