Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <0, 2, 4>
  - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as (2, 7) edge is missing.
  - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 7>
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as (2, 5) edge is missing.
  - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <1, 2, 7>
  - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as (5, 7) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as (8, 9) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <3, 7, 8>
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 since they are smaller.
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as (5, 8) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 since they are smaller.
  - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as (4, 8) edge is missing.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 6, 8, 9:
  - Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
