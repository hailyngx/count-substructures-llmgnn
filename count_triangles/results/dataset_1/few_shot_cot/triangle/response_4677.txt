Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list and not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 1 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. 6, 7, and 2 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 9 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 6 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 7 and 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No third node adjacent to both 8 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 
Output: [1]
