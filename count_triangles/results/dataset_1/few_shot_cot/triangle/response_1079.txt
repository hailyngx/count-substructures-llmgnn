Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained earlier, we will count the triangles in the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 5 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle because 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not a triangle because 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs that include Nodes smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
