Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, here is the breakdown of counting triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 2, 4 <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 2, 7 <0, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 2, 4, 6 <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 2, 4, 7 <2, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with nodes 2, 4, 8 <2, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, 7 <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Triangle formed with nodes 8, 9, 6 <8, 9, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
