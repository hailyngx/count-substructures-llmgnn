Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 1 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 2 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 3 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 4 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 5 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 6 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed for Node 7 with other nodes higher than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
