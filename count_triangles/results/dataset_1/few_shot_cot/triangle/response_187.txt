Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected forming a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 8>.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected forming a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 6, 8>.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
