Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the method described in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:
        
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. <0, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. <1, 3, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are larger than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are larger than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5. <3, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are larger than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has no other neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are larger than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. <3, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. <0, 1, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.
