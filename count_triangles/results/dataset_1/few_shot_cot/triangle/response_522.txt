Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1. No triangles can be formed. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2. Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6. Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No edges connected to Node 9. No triangles can be formed. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
