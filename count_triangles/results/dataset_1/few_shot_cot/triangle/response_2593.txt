Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Since Node 5 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 6, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 9>.
