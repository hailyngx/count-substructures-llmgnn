Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's go through each node step-by-step to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5. <0, 1, 5>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 1 and Node 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 1 and Node 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 2 and Node 3 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 4 and Node 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <2, 4, 9>
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 6 and Node 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <2, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <3, 4, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7. <4, 8, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
