Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are larger than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9 as they are larger than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip because there are no nodes larger than 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
