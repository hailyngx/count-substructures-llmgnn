Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 3.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 4.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 8.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
