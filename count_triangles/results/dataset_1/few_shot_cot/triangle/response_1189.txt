Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the instructions step-by-step as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
