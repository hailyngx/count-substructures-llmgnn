Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <5, 0, 8>, <4, 2, 8>, <7, 6, 8>.
