Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected directly in the edge list even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected directly in the edge list even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [1].
