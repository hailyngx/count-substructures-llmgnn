Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 0 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 1 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 1) -> 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 4 and 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 6) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
