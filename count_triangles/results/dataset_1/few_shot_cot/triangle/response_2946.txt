Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example.

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles as 3 is the smallest node with neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 6 as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles as 8 is the smallest node with neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
