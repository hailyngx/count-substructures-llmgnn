Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the only 1-hop neighbor is smaller.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the only 1-hop neighbor is smaller.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the only 1-hop neighbor is smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
