Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now enumerate the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 1 and 3. Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
  * No more pairs are possible for node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * No possible pairs for node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 and 5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
  * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 3 and 6. Triangle <2, 3, 6>.
  * No more pairs are possible for node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * No possible pairs for node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No possible pairs for node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No possible pairs for node 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with node 4 and 9. Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
  * No more pairs are possible for node 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * No possible pairs for node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No possible pairs for node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No possible pairs for node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
