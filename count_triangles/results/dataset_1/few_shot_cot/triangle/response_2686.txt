Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the starting node. <0, 1, 4>
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the starting node. <0, 1, 5>
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the starting node. <0, 4, 5>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

2. **Node 1:**
    - Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest node. <3, 5, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest node. <4, 6, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest node. <5, 6, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. **Node 6:**
    - Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 7 has no connections.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed as Node 9 does not have enough higher numbered connections.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, the final answer for the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
