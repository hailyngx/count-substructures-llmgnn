Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as it doesn't have any neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as the only neighbor is Node 1, and Node 1 is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 7) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
