Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the provided example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Nodes 1, 3, or any greater numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with greater numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
