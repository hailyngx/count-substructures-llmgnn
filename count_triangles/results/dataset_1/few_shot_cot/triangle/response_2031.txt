Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    <6, 8, 9>

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.

[<6, 8, 9>]
