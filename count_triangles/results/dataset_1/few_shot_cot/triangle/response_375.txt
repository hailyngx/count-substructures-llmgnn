Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4, as (7, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Only Node 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 5, but there are no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Both 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Only Node 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, but there are no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Both 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but there is no direct connection between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
