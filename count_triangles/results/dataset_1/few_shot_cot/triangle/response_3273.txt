Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 0, 0>]
