Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed as all other nodes are greater than 4. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
