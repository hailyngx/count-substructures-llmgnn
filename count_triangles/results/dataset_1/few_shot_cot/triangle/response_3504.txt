Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can form triangles with Node 1 as it only has one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair that can form a triangle with Node 3 is (7, 9), but since both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8 are skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair that can form a triangle with Node 9 is (6, 7), but since both 6 and 7 are smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
