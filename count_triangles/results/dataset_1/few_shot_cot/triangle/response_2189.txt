Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1, Node 2, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also connected, forming a triangle <3, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are also connected, forming a triangle <7, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
