Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the steps from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Since Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors, it cannot be part of any triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has already been considered in the triangles formed with Node 3.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 after considering other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
