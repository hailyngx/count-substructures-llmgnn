Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the method described earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected.
  - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
  - Skip because there are not at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
