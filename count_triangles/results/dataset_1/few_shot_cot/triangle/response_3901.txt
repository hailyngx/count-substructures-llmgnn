Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * There are no triangles involving Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Potential triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The pairs with higher numbered nodes have already been considered. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is: [0].
