Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
