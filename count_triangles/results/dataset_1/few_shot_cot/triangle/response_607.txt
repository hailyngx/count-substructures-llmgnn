Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Nodes 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Nodes 9 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are connected as mentioned in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
