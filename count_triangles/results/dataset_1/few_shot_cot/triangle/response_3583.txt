Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as it only has one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
