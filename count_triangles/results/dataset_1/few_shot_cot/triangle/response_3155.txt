Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process explained in the example above, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs remaining to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
