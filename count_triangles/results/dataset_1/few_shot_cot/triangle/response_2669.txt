Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2,2) - No triangle formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
