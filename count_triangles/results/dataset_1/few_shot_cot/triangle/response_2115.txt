Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7. They are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
