Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, hence no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not directly connected, hence no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Nodes 8 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Therefore, following the calculations for each node, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
