Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
