Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
