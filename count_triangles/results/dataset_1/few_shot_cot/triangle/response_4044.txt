Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

    Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
