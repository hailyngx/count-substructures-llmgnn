Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2. 
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 other nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
