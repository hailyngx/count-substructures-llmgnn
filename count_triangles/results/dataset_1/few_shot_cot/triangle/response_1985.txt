Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
