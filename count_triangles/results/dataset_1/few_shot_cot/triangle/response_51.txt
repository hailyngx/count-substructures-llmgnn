Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between 1 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 8, 9, as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
