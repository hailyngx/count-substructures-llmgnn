Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 is skipped as it has no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
