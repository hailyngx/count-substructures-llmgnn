Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * The rest of the pairs include nodes smaller than 8, so they are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
