Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (0, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (0, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - (0, 7, 2) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle: <0, 2, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 1) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

[1 triangle <0, 2, 7>]
