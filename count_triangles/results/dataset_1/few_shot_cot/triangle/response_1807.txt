Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
