Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, or 8 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it is greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs as no other nodes are greater than 8 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there is no node greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
