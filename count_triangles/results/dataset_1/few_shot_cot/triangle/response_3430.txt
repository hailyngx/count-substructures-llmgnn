Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
