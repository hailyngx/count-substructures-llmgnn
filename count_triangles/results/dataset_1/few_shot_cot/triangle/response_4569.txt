Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no connections to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Node 4 only has one connection and cannot form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Node 5 only has connections to Node 3 and Node 7 but does not form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
