Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
