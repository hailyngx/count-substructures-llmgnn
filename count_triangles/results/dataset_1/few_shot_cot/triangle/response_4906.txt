Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's now count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't enough nodes greater than each to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
