Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer in brackets is [2].
