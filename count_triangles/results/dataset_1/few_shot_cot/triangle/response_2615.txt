Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [3].
