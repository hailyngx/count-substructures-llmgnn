Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with a node smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 1 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with a smaller node than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 5 are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair where the node is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with a smaller node than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
