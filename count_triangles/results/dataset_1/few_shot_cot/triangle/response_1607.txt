Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 1, as both its 1-hop neighbors are nodes with numbers smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4, as both its 1-hop neighbors are nodes with numbers smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that have smaller numbers.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5, as both its 1-hop neighbors are nodes with numbers smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 is isolated with no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that have smaller numbers.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7, as both its 1-hop neighbors are nodes with numbers smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9, as its 1-hop neighbor is a node with a smaller number.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
