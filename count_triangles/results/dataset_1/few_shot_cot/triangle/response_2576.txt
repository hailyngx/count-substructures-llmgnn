Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one node present.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there isn't a pair of nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
