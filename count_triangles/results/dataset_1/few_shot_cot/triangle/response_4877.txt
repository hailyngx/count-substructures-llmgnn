Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9 are skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
