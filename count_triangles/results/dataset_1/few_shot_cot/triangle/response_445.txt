Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph node by node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
