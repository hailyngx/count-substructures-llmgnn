Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it has a smaller number.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
