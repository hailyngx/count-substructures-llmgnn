Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
This is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
