Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving on to Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip the only pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
Inside brackets [], the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, and <6, 7, 8>.
