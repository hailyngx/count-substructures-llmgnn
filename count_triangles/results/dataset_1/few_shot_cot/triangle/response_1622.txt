Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, 3, and 4:
    * Skipped because they have no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs found for Node 9 as Node 9 is the largest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer in brackets is [2].

[Note: The triangles found are <5, 7, 8> and <5, 8, 9>.]
