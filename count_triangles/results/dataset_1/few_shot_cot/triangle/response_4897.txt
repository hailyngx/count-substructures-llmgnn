Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are all greater than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are all greater than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * All pairs with Node 4 are skipped as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * All pairs with Node 5 are skipped as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * All pairs with Node 6 are skipped as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * All pairs with Node 7 are skipped as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are all smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * All pairs with Node 9 are skipped as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.
        
        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
