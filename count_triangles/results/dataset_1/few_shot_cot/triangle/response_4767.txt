Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip Pair 1: (4, 7) as both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip Pair 1: (0, 3) as both nodes are smaller than 2.
    - Skip Pair 2: (2, 7) as both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    - Skip Pair 3: (7, 8) as both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip Pair 1: (1, 4) as both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    - Skip Pair 2: (2, 9) as both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
