Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 3) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and there is a self-loop (3, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [8].
