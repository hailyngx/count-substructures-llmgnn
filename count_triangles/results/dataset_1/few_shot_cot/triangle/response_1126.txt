Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because 9 is 1-hop neighbor of 0 and there is an edge (0, 9) connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
