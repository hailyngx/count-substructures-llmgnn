Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example given: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 9), but since 1 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
