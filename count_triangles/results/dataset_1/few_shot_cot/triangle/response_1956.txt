Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than some of the previous nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
