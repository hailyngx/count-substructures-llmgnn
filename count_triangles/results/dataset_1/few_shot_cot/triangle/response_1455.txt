Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected (2, 8) as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected (2, 9) as shown in the edge list.
  - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected (8, 9) as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected (2, 4) as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected (8, 9) as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  - Node 3 does not have any neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, as they are smaller than 4.
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 4 with its neighbors.

* Node 5:
  - Skip all pairs, as all potential pairs have smaller nodes than 5 which have been already covered. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
  - Skip all pairs, as all potential pairs have smaller nodes than 6 which have been already covered. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
  - The only pair to consider is (9, 9), and as it involves the same node twice, no triangle is formed.

* Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
  - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
  - No triangles can be formed by Node 9 with its neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  

[<0, 8, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 8, 9>]
