Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. 
Outputting the unique triangles found in brackets:
[<3, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>].
