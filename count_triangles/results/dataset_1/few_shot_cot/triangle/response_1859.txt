Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    - Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    Final Count for Node 0: 3

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    - Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    Final Count for Node 1: 3

3. Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    Final Count for Node 2: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    Final Count for Node 3: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    Final Count for Node 4: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    Final Count for Node 5: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    Final Count for Node 6: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Nodes 0 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 7.
    Final Count for Node 7: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    Final Count for Node 8: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    Final Count for Node 9: 0

Summing up the counts for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <7, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 8>]
