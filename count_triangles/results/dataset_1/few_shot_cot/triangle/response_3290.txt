Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 - 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 - 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
