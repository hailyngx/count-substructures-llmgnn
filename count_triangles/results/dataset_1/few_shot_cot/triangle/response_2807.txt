Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0.
    * Skip pair with Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, and 8 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 3 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 4 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and 8 and 1 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is not connected to any other node.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Since Node 5 is not connected to any other node, no triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Since Node 7 is not connected to any other node, no triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 8, and 9 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 9, 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 9, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
