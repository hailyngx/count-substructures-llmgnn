Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Since there are no edges connected to Node 1, there are no triangles involving Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * Since there are no edges connected to Node 8, there are no triangles involving Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * No valid pairs for forming triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
