Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 4.
            * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 4.

        Perform the same steps for Nodes 5 to 9.

        The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
