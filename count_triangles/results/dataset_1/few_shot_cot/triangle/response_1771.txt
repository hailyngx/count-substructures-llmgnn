Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4).
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's less than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
