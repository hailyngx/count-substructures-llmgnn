Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * No possible triangle as there are no pairs.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 3:
        * No possible triangle as there are no pairs.

    * Node 4:
        * No possible triangle as there are no pairs.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
        * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
