Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles for each node and then sum them up at the end.

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 3 are not connected.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 7 are not connected.
            * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle because 1 and 9 are not connected.
            * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 7 are not connected.
            * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 9 are not connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

        Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
