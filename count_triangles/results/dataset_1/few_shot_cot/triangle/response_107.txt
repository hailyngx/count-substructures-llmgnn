Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 8 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The unique triangle found is <1, 3, 8>.
