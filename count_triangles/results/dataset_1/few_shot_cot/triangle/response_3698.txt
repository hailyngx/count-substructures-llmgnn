Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No edge between 5 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No common neighbor for triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No edge between 6 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected. No common neighbor for triangle.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. No common neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors for Node 1. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No common neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors for Node 3. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors with higher indices.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors with higher indices.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbors with higher indices.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No common neighbor for triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No edge between 9 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 7 and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
