Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs that include Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed: <7, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of pairs with at least two nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
