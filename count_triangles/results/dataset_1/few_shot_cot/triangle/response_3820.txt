Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs since there are no nodes greater than 0. No triangles formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs since there are no nodes greater than 1. No triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs since there are no nodes greater than 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
