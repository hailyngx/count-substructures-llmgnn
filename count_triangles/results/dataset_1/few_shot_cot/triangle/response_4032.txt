Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0). No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1). 
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Connected as (3, 6). No third connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Connected as (4, 6). No third connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Connected as (4, 8). No third connection. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2). 
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3). 
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Connected as (7, 8). No third connection. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). No triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
