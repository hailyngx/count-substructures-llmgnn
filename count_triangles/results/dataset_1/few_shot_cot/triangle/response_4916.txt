Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more possible triangles for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more possible triangles for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more possible triangles for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more possible triangles for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
