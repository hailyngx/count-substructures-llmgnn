Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
