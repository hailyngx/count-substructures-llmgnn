Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
