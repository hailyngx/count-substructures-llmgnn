Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No possible triangles with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No possible triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No possible triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No possible triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are connected as (9, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    No possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
