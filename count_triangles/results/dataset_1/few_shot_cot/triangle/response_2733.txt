Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as no other nodes have higher numbers than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as no other nodes have higher numbers than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as no other nodes have higher numbers than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as no other nodes have higher numbers than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
