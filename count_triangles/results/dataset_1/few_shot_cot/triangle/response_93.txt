Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the process shown in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles to form with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 3
* The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 8>, <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
