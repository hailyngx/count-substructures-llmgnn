Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Skip any pairs including Node 1 since it is smaller.
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs including Node 0 since it is smaller.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * No pairs to consider with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs including Node 6 since it is larger.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 5 since they are smaller.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 4 since they are smaller.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * No pairs to consider with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
