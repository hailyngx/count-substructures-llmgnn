Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 as it's smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 and Node 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs that involve nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
