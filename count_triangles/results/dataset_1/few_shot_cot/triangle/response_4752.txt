Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 does not have any neighbors, no triangles can be formed with it.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 9 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
