Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 4) since 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair (7, 8) since 7 is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as Node 6 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also connected as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are also connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
