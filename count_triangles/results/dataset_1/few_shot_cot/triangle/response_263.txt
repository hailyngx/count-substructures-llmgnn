Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same method as demonstrated before, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * There are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
