Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 3 to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 5 to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 6 to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
        
    * Node 7:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 7 to form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

    Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
