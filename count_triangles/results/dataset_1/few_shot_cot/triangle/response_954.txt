Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * No other pairs with Node 0 are valid as they involve nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles as they involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * No other pairs with Node 3 are valid as they involve nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * No other pairs with Node 5 are valid as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * No other pairs with Node 6 are valid as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * No other pairs with Node 7 are valid as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs for forming triangles as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
