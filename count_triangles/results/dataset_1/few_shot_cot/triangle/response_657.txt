Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * The only possible pair is (4, 8), but since both 4 and 8 are smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 and 7:
  * Similarly, no pairs are found for triangles.

* Node 8:
  * The only possible pair is (5, 9), but since both 5 and 9 are smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pairs left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
