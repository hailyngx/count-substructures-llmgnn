Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected because (2, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
