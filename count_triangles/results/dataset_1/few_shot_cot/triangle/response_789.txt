Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
