Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 7) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 7) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1 as there are not enough nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Similar to Node 0, there are no triangles to form with the available nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles available with the current node set.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Other nodes) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
