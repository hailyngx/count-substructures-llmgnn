Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Only one pair possible with Node 9, but not enough nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
