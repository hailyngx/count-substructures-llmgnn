Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pairs involving Node 0 are skipped as 0 is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pairs involving Node 0 are skipped as 0 is smaller than 3.
            * Pairs involving Node 1 are skipped as 1 is smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 3 are skipped as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 5, 6, and 7:
            * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        * Node 8:
            * Pairs involving Nodes 0 and 4 are skipped as they are smaller than 8.
            * Pairs involving Node 1 are skipped as 1 is smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Pairs involving Nodes 0 and 4 are skipped as they are smaller than 9.
            * Pairs involving Node 1 are skipped as 1 is smaller than 9.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
