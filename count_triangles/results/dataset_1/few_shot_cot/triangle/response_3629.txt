Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs available for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs available for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs available for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs available for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No applicable pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs available for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs available for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [5].
