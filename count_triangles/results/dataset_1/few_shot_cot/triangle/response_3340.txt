Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Moving forward with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip the only pair with Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
