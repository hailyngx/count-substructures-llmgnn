Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] unique triangles in the given graph: <2, 0, 4>, <4, 1, 3>.
