Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs, as there needs to be at least 2 nodes greater than 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
