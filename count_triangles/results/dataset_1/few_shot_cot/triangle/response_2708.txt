Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
  * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
  * Pair 4: (1, 7) - No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
  * Pair 5: (1, 8) - No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 6: (2, 4) - Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
  * Pair 7: (2, 6) - No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
  * Pair 8: (2, 7) - No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
  * Pair 9: (2, 8) - No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 10: (4, 6) - No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
  * Pair 11: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
  * Pair 12: (4, 8) - No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 13: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
  * Pair 14: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 15: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  
* Node 1:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
  * Pair 2: (4, 6) - No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
  * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
  * Pair 4: (4, 9) - No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
  * Pair 5: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
  * Pair 6: (5, 8) - Triangle formed <2, 5, 8>.
  * Pair 7: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
  * Pair 8: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pair available to form a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 2

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
