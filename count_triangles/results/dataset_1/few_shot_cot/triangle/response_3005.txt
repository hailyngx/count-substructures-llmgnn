Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges. 

Starting with each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed between 0, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed between 0, 2, and 6.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed between 0, 4, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed between 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed between 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed between 2, 3, and 6.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed between 2, 4, and 6.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed between 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed between 3, 4, and 6.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed between 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
