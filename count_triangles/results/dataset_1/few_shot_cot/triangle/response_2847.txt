Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No edge between 2 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No edge between 2 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No edge between 3 and 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No edge between 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No edge between 4 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Node (4, 9) is an edge. Now, we need to check the third node that can form a triangle with 1, 4, and 9.
        * Triangle found: <1, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No edge between 7 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No edge between 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No edge between 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6, as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
