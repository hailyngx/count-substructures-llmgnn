Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3 (Triangles <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 5>)

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <3, 6, 8>)

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the output will be [4].
