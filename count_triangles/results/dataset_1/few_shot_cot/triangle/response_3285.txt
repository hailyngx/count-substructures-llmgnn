Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, we will now determine the number of triangles in the graph provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * No edges connected to Node 3, so no triangles possible.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not connected.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 8 and 9:
        * Skipped due to not having at least two nodes greater than 8 or 9 for triangle formation.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 0.

    Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
