Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, but no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 2, 9>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>)

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 9 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 2, 9>)

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are connected, but no other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <3, 2, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, and <4, 5, 9>
