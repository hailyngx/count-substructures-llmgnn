Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has only one neighbor (9) and therefore cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> Not considered as it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> Not considered as it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> Not considered as it's a self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
