Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Let's find the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
