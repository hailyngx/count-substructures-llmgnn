Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 2 to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
