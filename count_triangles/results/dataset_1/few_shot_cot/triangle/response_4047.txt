Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

7. Node 6:
    - There are no pairs to consider for Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - There are no pairs to consider for Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    - There are no pairs to consider for Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
