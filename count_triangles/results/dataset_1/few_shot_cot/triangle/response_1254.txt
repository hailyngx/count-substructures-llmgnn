Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided in the previous explanation, let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3, and there is a self-loop for 9. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with as all other nodes are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with as all other nodes are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    - Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, and there is a self-loop for 9. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7, and there is a self-loop for 8. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No other nodes to form triangles with as all other nodes are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of itself, and there is a self-loop for 9. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
