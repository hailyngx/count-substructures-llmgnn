Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 0 are also connected as (3, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with as all other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with as all neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
