Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
