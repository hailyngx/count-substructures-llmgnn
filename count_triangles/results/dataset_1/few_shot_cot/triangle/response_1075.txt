Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph, we can find the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
