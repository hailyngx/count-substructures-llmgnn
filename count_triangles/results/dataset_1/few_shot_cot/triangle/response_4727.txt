Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's identify the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because they are not connected directly or through a common node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected or through a common node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected or through a common node. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected or through a common node. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair to consider is (2, 8), but since they are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
\[5\]

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
