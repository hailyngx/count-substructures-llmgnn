Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the steps shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it will have all 1-hop neighbors in smaller nodes.

* Node 5:
    No triangles are formed with Node 5 as it will have all 1-hop neighbors in smaller nodes.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it will have all 1-hop neighbors in smaller nodes.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it will have all 1-hop neighbors in smaller nodes.

* Node 9:
    No triangles are formed with Node 9 as it will have all 1-hop neighbors in smaller nodes. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
