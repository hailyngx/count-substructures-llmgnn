Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 7, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
