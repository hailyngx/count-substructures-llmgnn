Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs involving Node 2 due to no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs involving Node 3 due to no >= 2 nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * No pairs involving Node 5 due to no >= 2 nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
