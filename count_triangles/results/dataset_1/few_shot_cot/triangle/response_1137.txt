Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
[7]

Explanation of how triangles are counted for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Triangle formed <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
