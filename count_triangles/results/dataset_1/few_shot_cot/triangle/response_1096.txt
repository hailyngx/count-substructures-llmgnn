Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No neighbors, so no triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 7, 0>)

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<6, 8, 0>)

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
