Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped due to being smaller than previous nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped due to having no pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
