Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Triangle Formed: <0, 1, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) - Triangle Formed: <0, 3, 7>
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle Formed: <1, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle Formed: <2, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) - No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>.
