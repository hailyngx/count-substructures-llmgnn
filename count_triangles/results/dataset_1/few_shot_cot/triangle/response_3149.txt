Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as described in the example above to count the triangles in the graph you provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 to 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
