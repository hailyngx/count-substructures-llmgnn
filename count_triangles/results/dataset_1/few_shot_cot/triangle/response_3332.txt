Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, we'll calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5, and no other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No pairs to consider as 7 has no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
