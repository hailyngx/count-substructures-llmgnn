Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, 6, and 9:
    * Skipped calculations as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than these nodes to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 or 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
