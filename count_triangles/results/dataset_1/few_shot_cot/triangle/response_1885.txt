Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the given example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 8). 
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 4).
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * There are no pairs to consider for triangles involving these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Thus, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
