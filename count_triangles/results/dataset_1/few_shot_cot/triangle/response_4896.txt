Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:
    * Skipped due to the absence of larger nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
