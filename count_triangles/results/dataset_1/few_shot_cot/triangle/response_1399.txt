Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
    - No possible triangles with other nodes as they are all distinct and not connected to each other.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    - No possible triangles with other nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
    - No possible triangles with other nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4**:
    - No possible triangles with smaller nodes.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
    - No possible triangles with smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
    - No possible triangles with smaller nodes.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7**:
    - No possible triangles with other nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
    - No possible triangles with smaller nodes.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - No possible triangles with smaller nodes.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
