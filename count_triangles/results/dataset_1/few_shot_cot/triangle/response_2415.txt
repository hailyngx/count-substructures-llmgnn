Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same procedure outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the starting node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the starting node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the starting node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the starting node.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:

Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
