Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 1:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 1 to form triangles.
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 2 to form triangles.
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 3 to form triangles.
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 7 to form triangles.
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip this node as there are not enough nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
