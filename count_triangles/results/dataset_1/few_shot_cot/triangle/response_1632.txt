Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (1, 5) is not in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (1, 8) is not in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (1, 9) is not in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (2, 5) is not in the adjacency list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (2, 9) is not in the adjacency list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 3), but since 7 is smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs with two nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
