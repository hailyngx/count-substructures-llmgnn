Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4. Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
        * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
        * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
        * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
        * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
        * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
        * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
        * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
        * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
        * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.<1, 3, 4>
