Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 8, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 9, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (4, 9, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (9, 4, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5, 6, 7:
    - Skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
