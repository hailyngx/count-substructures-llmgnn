Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same method as demonstrated in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
