Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 6, 7 as they are not connected to 2.
  * No triangle formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangle formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 7 as they are not connected to 6.
  * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Only consider (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].
