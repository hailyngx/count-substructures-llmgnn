Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 5 as it is greater than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip nodes 1 and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is greater than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
