Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 2. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4. Triangle <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 5. Triangle <2, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 6 is not connected to Node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 9. Triangle <2, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5. Triangle <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 7. Triangle <3, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as Node 8 is not connected to Node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7. Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7. Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7. Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 9. Triangle <4, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 and Node 2. Triangle <7, 9, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
