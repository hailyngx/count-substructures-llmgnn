Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 or 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Adding up the individual triangles from each node:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

Unique triangles found in the graph: 
<0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 8, 9>.
