Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has only 1 neighbor (insufficient for triangles).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has only 1 neighbor (insufficient for triangles).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has only 1 neighbor (insufficient for triangles).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has only 3 neighbors (insufficient for triangles).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Only pairs with Node 0 are considered due to being smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
