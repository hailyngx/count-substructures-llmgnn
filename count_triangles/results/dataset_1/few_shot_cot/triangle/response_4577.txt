Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair with smaller nodes than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
