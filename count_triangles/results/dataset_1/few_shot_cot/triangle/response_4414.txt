Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}
