Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 1.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
   - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2**:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3**:
   - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
   - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 and Node 9.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. **Node 7**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8**:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9**:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
