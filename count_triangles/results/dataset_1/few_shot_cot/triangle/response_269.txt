Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as no other nodes are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
