Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined step-by-step in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes with higher numbers to form triangles, the count for each of them is 0.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
