Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no larger numbered nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
