Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example given:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
        
        The unique triangles found are <4, 5, 6> and <4, 6, 5>.

        So, the final answer is [6].
