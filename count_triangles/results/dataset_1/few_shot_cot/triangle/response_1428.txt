Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as demonstrated in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 5, as they are directly connected (1, 0, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 and Node 9, as they are directly connected (5, 1, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 8, as they are directly connected (2, 4, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 8, as they are directly connected (3, 4, 8).
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 9, as they are directly connected (3, 8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with remaining pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with remaining pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with pairs for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
