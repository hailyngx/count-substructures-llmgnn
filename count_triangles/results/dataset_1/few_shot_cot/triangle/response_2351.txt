Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as all possible nodes are smaller than 2. No triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all possible nodes are smaller than 4. No triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as all possible nodes are smaller than 5. No triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all possible nodes are smaller than 6. No triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [3].
