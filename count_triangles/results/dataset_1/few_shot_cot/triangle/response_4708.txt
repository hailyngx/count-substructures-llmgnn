Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with 1-hop neighbors of Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed with 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with 1-hop neighbors of Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with 1-hop neighbors of Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
