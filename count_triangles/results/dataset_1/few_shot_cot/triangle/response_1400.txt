Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are connected. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected. No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with 5 as it is smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs to consider as Node 7 has no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip pair with Node 6 as it is smaller.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 6 as they are smaller.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
