Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as Node 8 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
