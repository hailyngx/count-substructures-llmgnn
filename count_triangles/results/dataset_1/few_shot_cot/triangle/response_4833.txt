Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected in the graph. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
