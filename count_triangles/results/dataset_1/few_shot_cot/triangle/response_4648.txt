Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) - No triangle formed since 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - No triangle formed since 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed since 2 and 3 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - No triangle formed since 2 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed since 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed since 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed since 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
