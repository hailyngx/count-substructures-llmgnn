Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the steps provided in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
