    * Pair 19: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 20: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No pairs exist for Node 2 resulting in 0 triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest.

* Node 4:
    * No adjacent edges, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * All possible pairs form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No pairs exist for Node 6 resulting in 0 triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest.
