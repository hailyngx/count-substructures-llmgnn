Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
