Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Node 4 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and Node 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
