Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes since they have no 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
