Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> Nodes 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
