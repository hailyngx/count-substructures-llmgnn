Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) and (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 9>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 4) and (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 4, 9>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 4, 5>)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<5, 6, 2>)

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 2), but since 9 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
