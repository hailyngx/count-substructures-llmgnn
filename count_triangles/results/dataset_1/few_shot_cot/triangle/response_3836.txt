Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are also connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 5 are also connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
