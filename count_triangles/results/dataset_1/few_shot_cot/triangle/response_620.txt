Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the given instructions, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 5. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
