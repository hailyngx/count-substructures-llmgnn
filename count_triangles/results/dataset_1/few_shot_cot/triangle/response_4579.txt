Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
	* No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
	* No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
	* No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
	* No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
	* Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
	* No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
	* Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
	* Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
	* Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
