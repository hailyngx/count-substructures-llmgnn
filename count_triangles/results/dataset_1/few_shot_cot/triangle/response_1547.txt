Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there is no node greater than 2 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there is no node greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there is no node greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [6].
