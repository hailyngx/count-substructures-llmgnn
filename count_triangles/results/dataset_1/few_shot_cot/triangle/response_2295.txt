1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * Triangles involving Node 0: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 6>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Triangle involving Node 3: <3, 6, 7>

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbor nodes.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
