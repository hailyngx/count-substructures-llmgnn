Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed since 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed since 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
