Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:
        
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Skipped because Node 2 is smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Skipped because Node 2 is smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Skipped because Node 2 is smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Skipped because Node 6 is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Skipped because Node 6 is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * Pairs with Node 0 were already considered in Node 0's calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 were already considered in their respective calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pairs with Node 0 were already considered in Node 0's calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as they only have one or no neighbors greater than themselves.
    
* Node 9:
    * Pairs with Node 0 were already considered in Node 0's calculation.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
