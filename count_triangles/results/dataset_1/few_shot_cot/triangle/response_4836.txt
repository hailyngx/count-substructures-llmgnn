Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided, we can count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pair with Node 6 as it is smaller than 8.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
