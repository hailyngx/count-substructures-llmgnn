Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with edge (2, 4).
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with edge (4, 8).
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with edge (5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with edge (4, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with edge (5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
