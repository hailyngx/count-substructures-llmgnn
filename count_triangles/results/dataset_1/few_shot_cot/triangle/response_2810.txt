Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * All cases where Node 6 is the smallest numbered node are covered in other nodes' calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
