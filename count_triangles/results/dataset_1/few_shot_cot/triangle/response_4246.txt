Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
