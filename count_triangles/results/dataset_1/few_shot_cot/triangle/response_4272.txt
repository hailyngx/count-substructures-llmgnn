Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 3 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 7 has two 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 9 has more than three 1-hop neighbors, but none of the possible combinations are connected.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
