Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Only one neighbor, no triangle can be formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
