Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
