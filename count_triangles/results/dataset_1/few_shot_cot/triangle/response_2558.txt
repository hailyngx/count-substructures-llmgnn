Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
