Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}
