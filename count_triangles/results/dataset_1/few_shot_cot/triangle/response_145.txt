Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No edge between 3 and 4. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No edge between 3 and 5. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No edge between 2 and 4. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No edge between 2 and 5. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No edge between 3 and 4. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No edge exists with nodes higher than 3. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    - No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

So, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
