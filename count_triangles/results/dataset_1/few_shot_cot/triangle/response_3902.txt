Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined from the example above:

    * Node 0:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 1:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 6, 7>.
        * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 7, 8>.
        * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 3:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 4:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 5:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 6:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 7:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 8:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

    * Node 9:
        No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. (0)

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: [2] 
Unique triangles: <2, 6, 7>, <2, 7, 8>
