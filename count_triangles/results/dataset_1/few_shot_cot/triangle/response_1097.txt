Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's go through each node to count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be considered with Node 1 as there are no other nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, and 7:
    * No pairs can be considered with Nodes 4, 5, or 7 as there are no other nodes greater than them.
    * Total triangles with Node 4, 5, or 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, or 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4, 5, 7) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>.

So, the final answer is [2].
