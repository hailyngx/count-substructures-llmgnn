Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

The process will be repeated for Nodes 1 to 9 to find their respective triangle counts. Finally, all the counts will be summed up to determine the total number of triangles in the graph. Let's continue the process for the remaining nodes.
