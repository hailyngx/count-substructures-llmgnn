Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are larger than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected in the edge list.

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are larger than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected in the edge list.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are larger than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are larger than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are connected as (9, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are larger than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 6, 9>, <8, 9, 1>, <0, 1, 6>, <1, 6, 9>]
