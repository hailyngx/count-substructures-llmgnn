Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (1, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving only these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
