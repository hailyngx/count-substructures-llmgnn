Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as one vertex.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as one vertex.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as one vertex.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as one vertex.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as one vertex.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as one vertex.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as one vertex.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [4].
