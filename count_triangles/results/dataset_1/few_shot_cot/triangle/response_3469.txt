Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not a triangle because 2 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Not a triangle because 4 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Not a triangle because 4 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle because 4 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 9 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Not a triangle because 6 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
