Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it's smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with a single neighbor.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with the current available pairs.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it's smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with the current available pairs.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
