Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 1, 6>)

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) 
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
