Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by applying the same method step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Since Node 0 only has one 1-hop neighbor, there are no triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Since Node 5 only has one 1-hop neighbor, there are no triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Since Node 6 only has one 1-hop neighbor, there are no triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
