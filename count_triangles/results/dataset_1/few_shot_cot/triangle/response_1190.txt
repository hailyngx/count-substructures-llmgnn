Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip Pair 1 as both 1 and 2 are smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip Pair 1 as both 3 and 5 are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider with nodes greater than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip Pair 1 as 0 is smaller than Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

So, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
