Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 because it is larger than 0.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 because it is smaller than 1.
            * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 3) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

        So, the final answer is [4] with the unique triangles found being <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, and <3, 7, 9>.
