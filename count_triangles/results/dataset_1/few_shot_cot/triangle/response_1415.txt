Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * No possible triangles with node 1.

        * Node 2:
            * No possible triangles with node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 4:
            * No possible triangles with node 4.

        * Node 5:
            * No possible triangles with node 5.

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * No possible triangles with node 7.

        * Node 8:
            * No possible triangles with node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * No possible triangles with node 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
