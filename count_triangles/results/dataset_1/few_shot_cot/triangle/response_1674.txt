Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 2) -> Ignoring self-loops. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Triangles involving Node 2 have already been counted when processing Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> Ignoring self-loops. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> Ignoring self-loops. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> Ignoring self-loops. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Triangles involving Node 6 have already been counted when processing Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Triangles involving Node 7 have already been counted when processing Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> Ignoring self-loops. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
