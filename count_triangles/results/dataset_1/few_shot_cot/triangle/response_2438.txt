Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 4 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
