Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Node 0, 4, and 9 form a triangle. Triangle: <0, 4, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
