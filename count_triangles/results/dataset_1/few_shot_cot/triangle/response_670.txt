Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will identify the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected in the edge list, no other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs for Node 2 to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No pairs for Node 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected in the edge list, no other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
