Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 and Node 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and Node 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Node 1 and Node 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and Node 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and Node 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are greater than 1. No triangles are formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are greater than 2. No triangles are formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are greater than 3. No triangles are formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are connected. No other nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are greater than 5. No triangles are formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they have fewer than 2 greater nodes to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
