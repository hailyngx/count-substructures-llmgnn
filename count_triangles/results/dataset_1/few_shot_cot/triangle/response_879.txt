Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the methodology provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
    * Pair 5: (9, 3) -> Triangle formed: <0, 9, 3>
    * Pair 6: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 8>
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed: <3, 8, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 0), but as both are smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
