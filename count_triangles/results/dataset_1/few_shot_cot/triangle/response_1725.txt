Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, there are no triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles involving Node 5 as it has only 1 neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * Skip the only pair involving Node 6 since the neighbor is smaller.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles involving Node 9 as it has only 1 neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [3] and the unique triangles found are <>
