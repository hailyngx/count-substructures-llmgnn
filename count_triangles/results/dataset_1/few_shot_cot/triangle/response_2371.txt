Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 4, 9>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 4, 9>)

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 2, 7>)

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 4, 9>)

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
