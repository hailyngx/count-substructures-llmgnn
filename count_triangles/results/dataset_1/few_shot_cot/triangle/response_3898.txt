Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 7 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, and 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, or 8.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
