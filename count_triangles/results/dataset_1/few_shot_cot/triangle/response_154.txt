Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 7 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pair (3, 8) because 3 and 8 are smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 has only 1-hop neighbors but no higher numbered nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found:
[<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <2, 4, 8>]
