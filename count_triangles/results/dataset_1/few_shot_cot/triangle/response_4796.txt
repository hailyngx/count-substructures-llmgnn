Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because 2 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be considered with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be considered with Node 7 as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs with Nodes greater than 8, so no triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs with Nodes greater than 9, so no triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
