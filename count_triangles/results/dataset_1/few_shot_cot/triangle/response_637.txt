Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step method as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
