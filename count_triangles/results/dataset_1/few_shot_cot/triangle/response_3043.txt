Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
