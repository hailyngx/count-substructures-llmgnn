Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed <1, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed <1, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed <2, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed <3, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed <3, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Calculating the total number of triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
