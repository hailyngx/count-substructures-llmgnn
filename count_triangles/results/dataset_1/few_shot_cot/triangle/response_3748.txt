Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
