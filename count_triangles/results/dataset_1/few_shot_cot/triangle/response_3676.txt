Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skipping pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 and 8 are both smaller nodes, this pair is skipped.

* Node 8:
    * Skipping pairs with Nodes 1 and 3.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No connections to any other nodes, hence no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
