Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> Not a triangle as 1 is not connected to 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Not a triangle as 4 is not connected to 3.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle as 8 is not connected to 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles for Node 6 as there are no 2 nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles for Node 7 as there are no 2 nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
