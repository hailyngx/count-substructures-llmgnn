Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are larger than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are larger than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 as they are larger than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 4), but since 1 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 9), but since 1 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
