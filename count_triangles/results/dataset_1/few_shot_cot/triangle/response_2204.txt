Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Node 1 and Node 2 are connected to Node 0 and also connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Node 0 and Node 9 are not connected to each other directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form a pair with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are connected to Node 5 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and Node 8 are not connected to each other directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are connected to Node 5 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are not connected to each other directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are connected to Node 5 but not to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are connected to Node 5 and also to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
*[1] 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <0, 1, 2>.
