Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No valid triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * No valid triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
