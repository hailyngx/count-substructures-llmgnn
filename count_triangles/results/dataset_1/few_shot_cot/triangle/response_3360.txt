Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, and 3).
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4).
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
