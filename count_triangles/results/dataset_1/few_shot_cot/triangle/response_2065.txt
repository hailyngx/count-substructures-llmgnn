Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6).  Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * All pairs involve Nodes smaller than 4, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as each has only one 1-hop neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, [5] triangles are there in the given graph.
