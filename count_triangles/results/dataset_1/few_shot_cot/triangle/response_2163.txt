    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 7 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 triangles in the given graph.
