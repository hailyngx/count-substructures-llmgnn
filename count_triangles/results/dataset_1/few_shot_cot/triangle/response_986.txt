Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 5 has no neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has only one neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    No triangles can be formed as Node 7 has only one neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
