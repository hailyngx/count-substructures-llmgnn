Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
