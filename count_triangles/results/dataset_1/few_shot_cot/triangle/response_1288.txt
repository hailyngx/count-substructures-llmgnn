Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
