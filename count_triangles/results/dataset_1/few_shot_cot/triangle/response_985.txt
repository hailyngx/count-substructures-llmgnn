Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, we will count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2 and Node 3:
    * Skipped as they have no neighbors, and they cannot form any triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
