Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * The only possible pair to consider is (2, 9) since 9 is the only remaining node greater than 5 and is a 1-hop neighbor. However, they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9) as they are the remaining nodes greater than 7 and are 1-hop neighbors. They are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
