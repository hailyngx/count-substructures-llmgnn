Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: Skipped as it doesn't have any neighbors.
* Node 1: Skipped as it doesn't have any neighbors.
* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has one neighbor which is smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
