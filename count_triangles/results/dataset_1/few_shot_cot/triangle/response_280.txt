Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

Since the process continues up to Node 9, I will continue evaluating the remaining nodes to find the total number of triangles in the graph.

Proceeding with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9...
