Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
