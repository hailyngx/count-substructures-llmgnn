Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Only pair (7, 6) is possible, but since 7 is smaller than 6, it is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs available.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to no pairs available for forming triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
