Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are directly connected as (2, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
