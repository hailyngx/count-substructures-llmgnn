Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0) than Node 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2 to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip each node as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
