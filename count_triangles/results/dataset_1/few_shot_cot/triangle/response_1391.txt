Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 7>
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Triangle formed: <6, 7, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [8].
