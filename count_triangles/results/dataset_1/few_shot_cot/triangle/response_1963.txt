Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 4>, <2, 3, 4>]
