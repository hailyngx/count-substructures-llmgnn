Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}
