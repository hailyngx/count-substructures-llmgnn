Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 since they are smaller than Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Skipped as they do not have any neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
