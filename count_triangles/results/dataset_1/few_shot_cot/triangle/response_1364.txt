Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
