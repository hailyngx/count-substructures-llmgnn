Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph =  1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
