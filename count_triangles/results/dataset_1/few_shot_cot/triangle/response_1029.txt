Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for counting triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no neighbors of Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the graph.

So, the final answer is [2].
