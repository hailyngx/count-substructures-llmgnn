Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not a triangle since 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle since 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle since 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle since 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Not a triangle since 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle since 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Not a triangle since 0 and 7 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
