Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected. Triangle found <0, 2, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected. Triangle found <1, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are also connected. Triangle found <1, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle found <5, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 8 are also connected. Triangle found <0, 7, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 3 are also connected. Triangle found <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 unique triangles in the given graph.
The triangles are: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, and <1, 3, 9>.

So, the final answer is [5].
