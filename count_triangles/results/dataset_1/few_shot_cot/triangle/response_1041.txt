Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there is no node greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as all other nodes are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
