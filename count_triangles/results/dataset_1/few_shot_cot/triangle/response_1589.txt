Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Connected directly (2, 5). Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Pair 4: (3, 5) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Pair 5: (3, 6) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Pair 6: (5, 6) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Connected directly (4, 6). Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
            * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Not connected. No triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

        Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph:
        <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 6>.
