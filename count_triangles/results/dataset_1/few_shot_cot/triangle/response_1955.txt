Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the process demonstrated in the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and 4 and 7 are also connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors, and 4 and 7 are also connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6, as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
