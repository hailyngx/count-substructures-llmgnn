Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
