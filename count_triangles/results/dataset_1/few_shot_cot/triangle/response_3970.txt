Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 7, 9>.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed: <2, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed since there are no two additional nodes that can form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, and remaining higher nodes:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
