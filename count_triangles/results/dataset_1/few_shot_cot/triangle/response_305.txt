Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    - No more pairs are possible.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - No possible pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    - No more pairs are possible.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    - No more pairs are possible.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 2).
    - Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    - No more pairs are possible.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No possible pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No possible pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 3).
    - No possible pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - No edges connected to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
