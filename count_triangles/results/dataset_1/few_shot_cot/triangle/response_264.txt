Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1, as it is greater than 0.
    * No possible triangle with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangle with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
