Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the steps as described in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 0 because they involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<0, 1, 3>]

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 1 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 2 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 3 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 4 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 5 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [ <5, 7, 8>]

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 6 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [<0, 3, 6>]

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 7 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 8 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 9 because they either involve smaller numbered nodes or are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
