Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example with each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 since they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 since they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 since they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 since they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 since they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
