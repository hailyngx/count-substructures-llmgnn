Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
  - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
  - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
  - Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
  - Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 6: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>
  - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 2 to 9:

- Node 2:
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
  - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <5, 7, 8>
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
