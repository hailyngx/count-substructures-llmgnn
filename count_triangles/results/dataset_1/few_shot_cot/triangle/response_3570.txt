Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same methodology as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the root node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the root node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the root node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the root node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip the pairs with smaller nodes.
    - No valid pairs to form triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - Follow similar steps to determine the triangles for each of these nodes.

After identifying all triangles for each node, the total number of triangles in the graph is the sum of triangles found for each node: 

[<3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 2>, <0, 3, 9>] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
