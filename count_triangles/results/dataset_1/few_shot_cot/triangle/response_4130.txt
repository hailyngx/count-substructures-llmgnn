Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 3 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
