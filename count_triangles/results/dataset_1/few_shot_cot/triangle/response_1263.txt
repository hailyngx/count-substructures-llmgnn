Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 7, 5>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 9, 8>
