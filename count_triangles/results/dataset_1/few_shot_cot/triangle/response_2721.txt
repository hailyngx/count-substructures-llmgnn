Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph by following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
    * Similar to the previous nodes, there aren't enough nodes to form triangles with them.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
