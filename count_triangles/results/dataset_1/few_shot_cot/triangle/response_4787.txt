Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No neighboring nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other neighbors for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other neighbors for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other neighbors for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
