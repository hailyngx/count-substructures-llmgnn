Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
  * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
