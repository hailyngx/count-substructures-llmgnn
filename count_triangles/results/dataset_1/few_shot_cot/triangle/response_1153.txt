Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same methodology as the example given earlier, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Nodes 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are:
[<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 9>].
