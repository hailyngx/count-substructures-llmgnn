Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph using each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle to form with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle to form with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle to form with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle to form with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle to form with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
