Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Continuing the steps outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (0, 4) in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are directly connected as (0, 9) in the edge list. Not forming a triangle with just one pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
