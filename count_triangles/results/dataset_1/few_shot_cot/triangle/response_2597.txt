Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        - No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 1:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        - Pair 1: (6, 0) - Node 6 and Node 0 are connected via (6, 3) and (3, 0).
        - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
        - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
