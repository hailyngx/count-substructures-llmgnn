Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <0, 5, 8>)

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <1, 2, 8>)

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <2, 3, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <3, 5, 7>)

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there should be at least two nodes greater than 4 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there should be at least two nodes greater than 5 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there should be at least two nodes greater than 6 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there should be at least two nodes greater than 7 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped for the same reason as above.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
