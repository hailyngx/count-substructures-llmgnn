Response:
Following the process as demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 8>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 2, 3>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 4, 9>

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 7, 8>

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [8]
