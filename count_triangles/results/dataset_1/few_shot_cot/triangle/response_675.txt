Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [0].
