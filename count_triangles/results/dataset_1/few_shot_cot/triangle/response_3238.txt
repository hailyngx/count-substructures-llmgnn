Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed since 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Triangle formed <0, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed since 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) - No triangle formed since 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed <2, 3, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed since 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed since 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) - No triangle formed since 9 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed since 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed <3, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed since 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed since 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
