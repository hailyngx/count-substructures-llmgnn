Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) - 7 and 6 are directly connected (7, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7: All have at least one edge to a smaller numbered node, so no triangles can be formed with them as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
