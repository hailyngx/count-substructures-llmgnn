Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No possible triangles as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as there is no Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No possible triangles as Node 4 does not have 3 or more 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No possible triangles as Node 5 does not have 3 or more 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, they are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No possible triangles as Node 8 does not have 3 or more 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
