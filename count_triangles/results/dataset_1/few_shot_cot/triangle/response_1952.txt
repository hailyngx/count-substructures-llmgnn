Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9). No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6). No other 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with only two 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with only three 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with only two 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with four 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
