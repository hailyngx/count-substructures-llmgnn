Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed as node 0 has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2: No triangles can be formed with node 2 as it is a part of a triangle involving node 1.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: No triangles can be formed with node 4 as it is a part of a triangle involving node 3.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed as node 5 has no neighbors.

* Node 6: No triangles can be formed as node 6 has no neighbors.

* Node 7: No triangles can be formed with node 7 as it is a part of triangles involving nodes 1 and 3.

* Node 8: No triangles can be formed with node 8 as it is a part of triangles involving nodes 3 and 7.

* Node 9: No triangles can be formed as node 9 has no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
