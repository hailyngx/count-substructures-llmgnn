Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected. No third node linked to form a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected. No third node linked to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Only one 1-hop neighbor to form a pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
