Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph using the method described in the previous example:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. **Node 4:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. **Node 5:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    - No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [3].
