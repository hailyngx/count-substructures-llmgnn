Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Node 3 triangle count: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Node 4 triangle count: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes individually as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
