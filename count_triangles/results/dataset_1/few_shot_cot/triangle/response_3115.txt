Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 3: <3, 4, 9>

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3)
* Unique triangles: <3, 4, 9>

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph, and it is <3, 4, 9>.
