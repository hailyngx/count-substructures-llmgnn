Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}
