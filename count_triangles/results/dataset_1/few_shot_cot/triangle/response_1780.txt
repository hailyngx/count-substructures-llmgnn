Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 2) -> Not considering self-loop. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Since these nodes do not have enough neighbors to form a triangle, we skip them.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2 or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
