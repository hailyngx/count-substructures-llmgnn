Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, here is the count of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving a smaller node (Node 0) than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes (0 and 1) than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 2, and 3) than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes (0, 2, and 4) than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving smaller nodes (2, 4, and 5) than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
