Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
