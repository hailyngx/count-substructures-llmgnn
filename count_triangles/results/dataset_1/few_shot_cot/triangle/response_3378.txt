Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example with the given graph information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
