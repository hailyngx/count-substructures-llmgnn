Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 1: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 2: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <5, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 6: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8, as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected. Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles with Node 9 that haven't already been counted in previous node analyses. Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, and <5, 8, 9>.
