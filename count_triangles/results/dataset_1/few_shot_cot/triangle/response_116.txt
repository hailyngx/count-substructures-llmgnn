Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 (0, 2, 4).
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 (0, 2, 5).
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5 (0, 4, 5).
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 (0, 3, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 2, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
