Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 6), but since 0 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
