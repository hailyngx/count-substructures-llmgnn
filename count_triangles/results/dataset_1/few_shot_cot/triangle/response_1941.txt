Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not connected as (5, 8) is not in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
