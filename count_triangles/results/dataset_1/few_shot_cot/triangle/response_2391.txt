Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
        Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it's smaller than 1.
        * No triangles formed with Node 1.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles formed with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they are smaller than 3.
        * No triangles formed with Node 3.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles formed with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangles formed with Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
        * No triangles formed with Node 7.

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

    Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
