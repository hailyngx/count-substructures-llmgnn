Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the earlier example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Nodes 7 and 8 have no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with them.
    * For Node 9, we have:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
