Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step counting of triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Both 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
