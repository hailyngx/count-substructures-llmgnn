Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. 
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 2) as the nodes are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 8 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pair (0, 1) as the nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Skip pair (0, 2) as one node is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are also connected.
    * Skip pair (1, 6) as one node is smaller than 4. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 8 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 5 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 3 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
