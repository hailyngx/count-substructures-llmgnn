Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip the pair with Node 1 as it is greater than Node 0.
    * Skip the pair with Node 2 as it is already considered as smaller than Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pair with Node 2 as it is greater than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair with Node 2 as it is greater than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 9:
    * All pairs include nodes smaller than Node 9, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
