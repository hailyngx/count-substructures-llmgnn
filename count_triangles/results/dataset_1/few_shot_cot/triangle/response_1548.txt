Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip Node 1 as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 1 that are directly connected.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 5 that are directly connected.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 8 that are directly connected.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors for Node 9 that are directly connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
