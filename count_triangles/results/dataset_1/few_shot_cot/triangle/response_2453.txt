Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles present in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Connected. Possible triangle: <1, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Connected. Possible triangle: <1, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected. Possible triangle: <2, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as all nodes are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Connected. Possible triangle: <7, 9, 7> which is equivalent to <7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are no edges connected to this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there is only one neighbor which is smaller than this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
