Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the first example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.
