1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected based on the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [3].
