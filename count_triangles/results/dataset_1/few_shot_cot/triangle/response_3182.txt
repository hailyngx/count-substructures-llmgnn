Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}
