Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 0 as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 2 as the only neighbor is Node 0, which is smaller than Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 3 as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 4 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 7 as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as there is only one neighbor, and no other nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors with a mutual connection.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
