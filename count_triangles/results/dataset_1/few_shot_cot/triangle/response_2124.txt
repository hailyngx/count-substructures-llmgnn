Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.
    - Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle.
    - Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No 1-hop neighbors. No triangle.

- Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle.

- Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle.

- Node 5:
    - No pairs to form triangles. No triangle.

- Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle.

- Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve smaller nodes. No triangle.

- Node 8:
    - No pairs to form triangles. No triangle.

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to form triangles. No triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
