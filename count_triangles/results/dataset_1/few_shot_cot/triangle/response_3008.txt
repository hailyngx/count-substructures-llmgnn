Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbor set:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (3, 6) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as (7, 9) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there is no other node greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
