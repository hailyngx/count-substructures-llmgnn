Response:
Following the methodology outlined in the given example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 11: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
        * Pair 12: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
        * Skipped because they can only form triangles with nodes smaller than them.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
