    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Refer to Node 0's analysis for pairs involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Refer to Node 0's analysis for pairs involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as all pairs involve smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Refer to Node 0's analysis for pairs involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
