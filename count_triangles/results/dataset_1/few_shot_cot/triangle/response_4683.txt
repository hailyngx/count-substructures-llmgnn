Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (4, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, and <4, 5, 9>.
