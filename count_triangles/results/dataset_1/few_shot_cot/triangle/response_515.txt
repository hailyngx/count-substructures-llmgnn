Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, let's now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
