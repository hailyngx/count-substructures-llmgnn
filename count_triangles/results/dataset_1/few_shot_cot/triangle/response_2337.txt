Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it has less than 2 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has less than 2 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has less than 2 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 8 are also connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has less than 2 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
