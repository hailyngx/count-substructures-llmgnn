Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 3 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, 9:
    * Skipped as they have no 1-hop neighbors or are not involved in any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
