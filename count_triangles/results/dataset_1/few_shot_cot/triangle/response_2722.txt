Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the process described above, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Triangle: (1, 8, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Triangle: (1, 7, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
