Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also directly connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
