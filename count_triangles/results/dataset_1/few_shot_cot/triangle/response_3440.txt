Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 1 is the smallest.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 2 is the smallest.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 3 is the smallest.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 4 is the smallest.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 5 is the smallest.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 6 is the smallest.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 7 is the smallest.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 8 is the smallest.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are no 3 nodes such that 9 is the smallest.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
