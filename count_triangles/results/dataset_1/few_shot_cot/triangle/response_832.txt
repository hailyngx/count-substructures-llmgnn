Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
