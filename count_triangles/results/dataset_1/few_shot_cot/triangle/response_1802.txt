Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the given instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 0.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) is in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1)
* There are no triangles present with other nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
