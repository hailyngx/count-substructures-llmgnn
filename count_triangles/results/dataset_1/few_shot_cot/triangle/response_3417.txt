Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles with 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles with Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No additional triangles with 1-hop neighbors of Node 7.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
