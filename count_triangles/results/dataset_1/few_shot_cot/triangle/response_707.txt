Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (2, 3) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 3) and (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 6) and (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    Unique triangles formed with Node 2: <1, 2, 3>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 2)
