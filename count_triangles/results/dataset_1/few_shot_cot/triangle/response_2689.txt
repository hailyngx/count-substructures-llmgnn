Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
