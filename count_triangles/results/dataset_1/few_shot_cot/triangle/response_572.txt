Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 8, or 9 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) - 8 and 8 are directly connected but are the same node. Triangle formed (self-loop).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The answer is [4] with unique triangles <3, 5, 0>, <4, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 6>, and <8, 8, 7>.
