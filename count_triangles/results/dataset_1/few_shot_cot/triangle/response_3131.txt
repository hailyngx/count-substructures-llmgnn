Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 3 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 5 as the remaining nodes are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 6 as the remaining nodes are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 8 as the remaining nodes are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 9 as the remaining nodes are smaller in value.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
