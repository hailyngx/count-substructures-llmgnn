Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangle involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 7 as there are no neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

The final answer is [0].
