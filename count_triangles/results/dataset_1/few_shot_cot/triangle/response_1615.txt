Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped because it's smaller than all other nodes connected to it.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
