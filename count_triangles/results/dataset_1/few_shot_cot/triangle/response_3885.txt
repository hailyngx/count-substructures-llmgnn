Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 because it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 because they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 because they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 because they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
