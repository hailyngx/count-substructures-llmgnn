Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 5) and (0, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more valid pairs to consider. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
