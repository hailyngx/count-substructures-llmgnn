Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
