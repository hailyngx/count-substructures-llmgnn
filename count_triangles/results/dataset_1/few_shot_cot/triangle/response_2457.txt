Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs containing Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
