Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
