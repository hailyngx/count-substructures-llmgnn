Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
* Node 0:
            No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 3:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 4:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 6:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 7:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
