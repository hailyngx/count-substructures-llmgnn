Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected because (2, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected because (2, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected because (3, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other 1-hop neighbors of Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other 1-hop neighbors of Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there are no other 1-hop neighbors for them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
