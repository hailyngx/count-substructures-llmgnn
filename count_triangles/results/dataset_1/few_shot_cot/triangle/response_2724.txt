Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes with smaller numbers than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes with smaller numbers than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes with smaller numbers than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes with smaller numbers than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as each of these nodes either has no neighbors or no pair of neighbors are directly connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
