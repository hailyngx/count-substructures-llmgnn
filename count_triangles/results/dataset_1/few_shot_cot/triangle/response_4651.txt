Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 1 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
