Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided for each node in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles will be counted for Node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

        Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
