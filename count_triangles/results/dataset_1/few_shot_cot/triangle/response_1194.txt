Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 1> and <2, 4, 5>.
