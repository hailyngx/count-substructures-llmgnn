Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined earlier, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, and 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:  
[<0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <3, 8, 9>]  

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  
Final answer: [3].
