Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No pairs form a triangle with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
