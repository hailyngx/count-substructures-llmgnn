Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4 because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5.

        * Node 6:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * No pairs to form triangles with Node 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
