Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before to count the triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) - 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller.
            * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller.
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * No possible triangles to form as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
