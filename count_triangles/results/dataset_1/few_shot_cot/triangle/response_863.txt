Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected as (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip as there are no neighbors for Node 7 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there is no possibility of forming triangles with only one neighbor each.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
