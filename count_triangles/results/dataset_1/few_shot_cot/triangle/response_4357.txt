Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, Node 4, Node 6:
    Since they don't have at least two greater-numbered neighbors, they cannot form triangles. Skipped.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) is in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
