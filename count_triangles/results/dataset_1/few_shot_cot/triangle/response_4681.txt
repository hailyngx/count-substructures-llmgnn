Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node. 

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
