Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as outlined before, we will determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed since there is only one node connected to Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - No other pairs can form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed since there is only one node connected to Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node due to the limited connections.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed since there is only one node connected to Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs can form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - No other pairs can form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Not enough connections to form triangles with these nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
