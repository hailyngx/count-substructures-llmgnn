Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangle as there are not enough greater numbered nodes connected to Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - No possible triangle as there are not enough greater numbered nodes connected to Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No possible triangle as there are not enough greater numbered nodes connected to Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangle as there are not enough greater numbered nodes connected to Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangle as there are not enough greater numbered nodes connected to Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
[<4, 6, 5>, <4, 9, 7>, <4, 6, 2>]
