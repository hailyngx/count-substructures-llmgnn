Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with one single neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No further triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with one single neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with one single neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No further triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No further triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with one single neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No further triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with one single neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
