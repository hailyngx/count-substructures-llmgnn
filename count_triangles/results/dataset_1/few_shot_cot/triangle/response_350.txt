Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skipped as 5 is empty, and there aren't enough nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
