Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the detailed example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected because (1, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No edges connected to Node 5 exist. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 9), but since 3 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
