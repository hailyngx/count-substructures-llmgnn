Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 5 since they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip this node as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3 to form a triangle.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it is smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs are available to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip this node as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 to form a triangle.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
