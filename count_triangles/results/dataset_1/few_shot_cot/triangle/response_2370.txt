1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip edge pairs involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 5, 8>, <6, 9, 0>, <7, 9, 1>]
