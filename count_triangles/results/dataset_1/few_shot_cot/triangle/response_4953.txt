Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
        
        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No pairs for Node 5 as there are no nodes greater than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
