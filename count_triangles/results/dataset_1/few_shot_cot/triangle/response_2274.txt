Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share an edge with 0. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they share an edge with 0. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1, Node 2, and Node 7:
    * Since these nodes have no neighbors, they cannot form any triangles. Total triangles = 0 for each of these nodes.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 since it's smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 or 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they share an edge with 4. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles. Total triangles = 0.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 3, 4, or 9 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they share an edge with 6. Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles. Total triangles = 0.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
