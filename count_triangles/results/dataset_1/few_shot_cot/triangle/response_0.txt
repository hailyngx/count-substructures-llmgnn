Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) edge present in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) edge in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 2 as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are connected as (0, 4) edge in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) edge in the list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 5 as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair with Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) edge in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 8 as it only has a neighbor smaller than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 9 as it only has a neighbor smaller than itself.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
