Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method described in the previous example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as (1, 4) and (4, 1) are included in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip, as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as we have already considered the triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as we have already considered the triangle with Node 1 and 2 as the smallest numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there is only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as we have already considered the triangles with Nodes 0, 2, and 1 as the smallest numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
