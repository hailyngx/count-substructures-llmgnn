Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there is only 1 node adjacent to Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
