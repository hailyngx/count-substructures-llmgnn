Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected because (6, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 5 are also connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 6 are also connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

[<0, 4, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <4, 0, 3>, <9, 5, 6>]
