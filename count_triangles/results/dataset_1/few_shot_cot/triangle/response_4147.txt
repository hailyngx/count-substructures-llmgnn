Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are directly connected. One triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include smaller nodes. 
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller. 
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. 
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
