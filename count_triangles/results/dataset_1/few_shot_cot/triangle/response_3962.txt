Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as it has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as <1, 2, 3> is not present in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as <2, 3, 4> is not present in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed: <5, 2, 8>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <5, 9, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as <3, 4, 6> is not present in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as it doesn't have enough neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as <2, 5, 8> is not present in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs containing Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <9, 5, 7>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <9, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
