Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 4. No triangles can be formed with node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 5. No triangles can be formed with node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6, 7, 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one or zero neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 9. No triangles can be formed with node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 9>.
