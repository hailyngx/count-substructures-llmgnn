Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with them as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<5, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>]
