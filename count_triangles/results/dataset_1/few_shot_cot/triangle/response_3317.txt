Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed <0, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed <1, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 6 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
