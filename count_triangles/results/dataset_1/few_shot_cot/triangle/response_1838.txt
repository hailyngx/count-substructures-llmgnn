Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example before:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as it has no pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
