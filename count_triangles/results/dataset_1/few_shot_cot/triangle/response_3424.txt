Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 3>.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 3, 7>.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 3.

* Node 4:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
  * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
