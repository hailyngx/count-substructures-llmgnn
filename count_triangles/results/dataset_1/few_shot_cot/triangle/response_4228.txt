Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Node 1 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Node 1 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
