Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph using the method described earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 is isolated and cannot form triangles with any other node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
