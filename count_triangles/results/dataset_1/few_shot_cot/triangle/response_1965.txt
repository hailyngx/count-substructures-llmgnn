Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) from the edge list and are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has only one neighbor and no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has only one neighbor and no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are connected as (7, 8) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected as (1, 9) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as (1, 9) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no edges connected to it.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 9>]
