Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 3, 6>
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 6, 9>
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 2:
        * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <6, 2, 7>
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
