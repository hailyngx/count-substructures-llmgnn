Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip Node 0 since there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or Node 1, as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
