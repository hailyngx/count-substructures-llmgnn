Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as illustrated in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to consider with larger numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
