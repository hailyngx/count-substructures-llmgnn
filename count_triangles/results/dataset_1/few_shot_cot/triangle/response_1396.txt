Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
