Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) - 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
