Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 (they are the same node), but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than those nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 3, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 8>]
