Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the method described in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed between 1, 3, and 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed between 1, 7, and 0.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Node 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed <0, 3, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Node 2 and 4 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. Triangle formed <1, 2, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed between 1, 4, and 6.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Node 4 and 7 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed <1, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed between 2, 8, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and 7 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not form any triangles as the other possible nodes are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, and <6, 7, 8>.
