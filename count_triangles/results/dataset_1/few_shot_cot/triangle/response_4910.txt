Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the instructions from the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles for this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
