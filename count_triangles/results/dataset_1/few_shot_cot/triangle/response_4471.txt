Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the provided example, let's find the total number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
