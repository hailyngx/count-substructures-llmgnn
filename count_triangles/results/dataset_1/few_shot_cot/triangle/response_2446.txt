Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it only has 1 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it only has 1 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Node 3 as it is smaller than Node 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 4 and 5 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Both 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
