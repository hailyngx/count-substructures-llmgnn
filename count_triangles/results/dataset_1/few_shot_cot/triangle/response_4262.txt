Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 7 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 8 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 8 is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
