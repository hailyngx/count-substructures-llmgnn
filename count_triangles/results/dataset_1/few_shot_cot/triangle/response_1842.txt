Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [7].
