Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
