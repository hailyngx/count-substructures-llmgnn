Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

    * Node 0: Not connected to any other node, so no triangles can be formed.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Connected to both nodes, so triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> Connected to both nodes, no triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

    * Node 2:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Connected to both nodes, so triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 4.

    * Node 5: Not connected to any other node, so no triangles can be formed.

    * Node 6:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * No possible triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
