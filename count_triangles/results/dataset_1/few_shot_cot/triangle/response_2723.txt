Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's analyze each node in the graph to find the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - 1, 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) - 3, 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - 3, 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4, 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5, 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes less than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since 6 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are less than two nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.
