Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No new triangles formed involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No new triangles formed involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles formed involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles formed involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
