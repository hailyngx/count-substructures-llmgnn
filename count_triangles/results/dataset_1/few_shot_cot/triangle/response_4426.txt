Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 12: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 13: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 14: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 15: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 0 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Not enough nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
