Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the list of edges.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is greater than 7.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
