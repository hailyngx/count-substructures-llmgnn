Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we can consider is (4, 5). Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
