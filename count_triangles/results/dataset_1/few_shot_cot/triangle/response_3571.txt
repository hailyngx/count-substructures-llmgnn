Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
