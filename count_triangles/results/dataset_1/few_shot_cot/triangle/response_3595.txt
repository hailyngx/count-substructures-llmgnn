Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as its 1-hop neighbors are all smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as its 1-hop neighbors are all smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as its 1-hop neighbors are all smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as its 1-hop neighbors are all smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as its 1-hop neighbors are all smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
