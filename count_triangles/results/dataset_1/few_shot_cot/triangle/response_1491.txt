Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
