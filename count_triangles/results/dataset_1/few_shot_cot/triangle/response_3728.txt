Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 1. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 4. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs left to consider for Node 7. No additional triangles formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
[<0, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 2>, <3, 5, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <6, 4, 9>]
