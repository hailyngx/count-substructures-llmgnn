Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's analyze each node in the graph to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip the pair (0,4) as both nodes are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as Node 2 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pair (0,1) since both nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as Node 5 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as Node 6 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as Node 7 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle as there are no sets of 3 neighbors that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
