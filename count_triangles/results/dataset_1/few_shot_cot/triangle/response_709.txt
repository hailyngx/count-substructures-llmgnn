Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Nodes 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Nodes 0 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Nodes 1 and 5 are directly connected as (1, 5). No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Nodes 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Nodes 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Nodes 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7). No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Nodes 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Nodes 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
