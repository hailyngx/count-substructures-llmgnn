Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
