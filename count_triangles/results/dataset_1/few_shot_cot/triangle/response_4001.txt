Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, I will determine the number of triangles in the graph given.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle (0, 4, 6)
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle (0, 4, 7)
    * No other pairs in Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle (1, 6, 7)
    * No other pairs in Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No other pairs in Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Triangle (1, 3, 7)
    * No other pairs in Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3.
    * No other pairs in Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4.
    * No other pairs in Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5.
    * No other pairs in Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No other pairs in Node 7.

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangle can be formed as each only have one 1-hop neighbor.

Summing up the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
