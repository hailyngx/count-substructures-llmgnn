Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> 5 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 1 are connected as (3, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 1 are connected as (0, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (0, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 4 are connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
