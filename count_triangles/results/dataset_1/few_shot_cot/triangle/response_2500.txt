Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * The only possible pair to consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 6.
