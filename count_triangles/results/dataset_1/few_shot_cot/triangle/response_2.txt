Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Triangle formed: <1, 2, 5> (Nodes 1, 2, and 5 are all connected to each other).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8> (Nodes 4, 7, and 8 are all connected to each other).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no two other nodes connected to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [2].
