Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node and its 1-hop neighbors:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed by Node 0 since it doesn't have at least two 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Nodes 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    - Pair 2: (0, 5) -> Nodes 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1.
    - Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. However, they are not directly connected by an edge in the graph. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. They are directly connected by the edge (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. They are directly connected by the edge (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip Node 1 and Node 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. They are directly connected by the edge (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3. They are directly connected by the edge (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4. They are directly connected by the edge (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed by Node 5 since it doesn't have at least two nodes greater than itself.

* Node 6:
    - Skip Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6. They are directly connected by the edge (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7: No triangles can be formed by Node 7 since it doesn't have at least two nodes greater than itself.

* Node 8: No triangles can be formed by Node 8 since it doesn't have at least two nodes greater than itself.

* Node 9: No triangles can be formed by Node 9 since it doesn't have at least two nodes greater than itself.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, [6] triangles are formed in the given graph.
