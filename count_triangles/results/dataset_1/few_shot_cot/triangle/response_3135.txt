Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not connected because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes. There are no triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Thus, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
