Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
[5]

Here is how the triangles are formed:

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

All other nodes do not form any triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
