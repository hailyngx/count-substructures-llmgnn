Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4)

Response:
Following the same process as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped based on the same reasoning as the previous nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
