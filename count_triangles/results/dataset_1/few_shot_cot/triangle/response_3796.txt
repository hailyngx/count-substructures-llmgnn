Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same approach as detailed in the previous example, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No connections, so no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
