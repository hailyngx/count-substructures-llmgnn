Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, and the following nodes have fewer than 2 higher numbered neighboring nodes and will not form any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
