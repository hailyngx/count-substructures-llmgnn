Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided: 

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 1) -> Node 0 is not connected to itself. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7. 
    
    Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
