Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same method used in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1, 2, ..., 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 2, ..., 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 3, ..., 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, ..., 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, ..., 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered as all 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered as the only 1-hop neighbor of Node 9 is smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Other Nodes) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
