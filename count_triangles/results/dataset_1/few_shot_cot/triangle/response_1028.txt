Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the introductory example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles possible with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles possible with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
