Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected directly as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle: <0, 6, 7>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected directly as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle: <1, 5, 9>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected directly as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangle: <3, 7, 9>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
