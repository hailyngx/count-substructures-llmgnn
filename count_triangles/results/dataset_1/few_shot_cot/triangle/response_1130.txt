Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 12: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 for all other nodes = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
