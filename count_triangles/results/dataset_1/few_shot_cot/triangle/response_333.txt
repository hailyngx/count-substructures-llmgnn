Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1 (0).
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because (4, 6) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2 (0, 1).
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3 (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4 (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
