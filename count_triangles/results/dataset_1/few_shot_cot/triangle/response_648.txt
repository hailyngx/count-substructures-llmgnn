Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip pairs including Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (2, 3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (2, 4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (2, 5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (2, 6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

10. Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
