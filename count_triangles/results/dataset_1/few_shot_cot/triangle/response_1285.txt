Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
