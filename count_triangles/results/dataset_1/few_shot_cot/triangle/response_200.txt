Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 0) -> 2 and 0 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are connected through (2, 3) edge, but 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipping pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle with a single node, so total triangles with Node 5 are 0.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible with a single node, so total triangles with Node 7 are 0.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles possible with single nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
