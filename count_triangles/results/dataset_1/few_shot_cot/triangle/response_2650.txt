Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * Unique triangles involving Node 0: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 1: <1, 3, 7>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as no other nodes are greater than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles involving Node 7: <7, 5, 9>

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 5
* Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 3, 7>, <7, 5, 9>

Therefore, there are total of 5 triangles in the given graph.
