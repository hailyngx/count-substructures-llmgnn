Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.  
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipping pairs involving smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
