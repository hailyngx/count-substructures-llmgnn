Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. Move to the next node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with. Move to the next node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 9, 0>, <1, 3, 1>, <1, 5, 1>, <1, 6, 1>, <1, 7, 1>, <2, 7, 2>, <5, 9, 5>, <6, 7, 6>, <3, 6, 3>]
