Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
          
        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

        Hence, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
