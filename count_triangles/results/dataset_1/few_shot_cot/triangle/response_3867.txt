Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
