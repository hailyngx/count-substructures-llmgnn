Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
