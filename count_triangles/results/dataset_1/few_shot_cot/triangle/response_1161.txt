Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip 1 and consider 3 as the next smallest node.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * The only pair with 2 as one of the nodes is (2, 5), but 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes 2 and 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes 0, 5, and 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair with 7 as one of the nodes is (7, 6), but 7 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * The only pair with 8 as one of the nodes is (8, 3), but 8 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair with 9 as one of the nodes is (9, 6), but 9 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
