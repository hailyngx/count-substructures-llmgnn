Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 and 8, it's not possible to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9, it's not possible to form a triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 8>]
