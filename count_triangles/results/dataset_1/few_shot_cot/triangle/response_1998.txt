Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all the pairs that involve Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all the pairs that involve Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3 to Node 9:
    * These nodes either have smaller numbered node(s) as their 1-hop neighbors or do not have at least 2 1-hop neighbors greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
