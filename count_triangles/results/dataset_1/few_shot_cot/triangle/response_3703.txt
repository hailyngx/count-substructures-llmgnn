Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
