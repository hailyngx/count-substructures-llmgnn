Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions given in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0**:
   - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1**:
   - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
   - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

5. **Node 4**:
   - Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
   - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

7. **Node 6**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

8. **Node 7**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

9. **Node 8**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

10. **Node 9**:
   - No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
