Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 1), but since 0 and 1 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are all smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, and 5 as they are all smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
