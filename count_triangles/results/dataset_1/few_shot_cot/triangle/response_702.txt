Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 8, 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
