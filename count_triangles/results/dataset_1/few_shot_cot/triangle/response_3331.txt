Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as Node 5 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs are available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as Node 7 is connected to only lower-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they have no pairs with nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
