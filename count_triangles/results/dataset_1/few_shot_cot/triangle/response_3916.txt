Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pair with Node 5 as it is smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
