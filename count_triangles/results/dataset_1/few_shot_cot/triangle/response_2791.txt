Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph by checking each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since it's smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> 6 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but self-loop edges are not considered for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
