Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the starting example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be considered to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
