Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed as there is no such edge connected to 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4: 
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> No triangle formed as there is no such edge connected to Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because they have fewer than 2 neighbors each that are greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
