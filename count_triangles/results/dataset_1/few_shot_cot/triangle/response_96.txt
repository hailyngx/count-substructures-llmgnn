Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 8, 9:
    * No possible triangles with these nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
