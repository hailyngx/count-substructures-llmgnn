Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
