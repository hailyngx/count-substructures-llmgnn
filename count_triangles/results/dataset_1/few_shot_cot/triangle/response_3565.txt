Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skipped as pairs with smaller nodes are not considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
