Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle.
  * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
  * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
