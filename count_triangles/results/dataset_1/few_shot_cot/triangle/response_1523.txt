Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example given, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph using the provided information step by step:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Node 3 has no connections to form triangles. No need to proceed.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
