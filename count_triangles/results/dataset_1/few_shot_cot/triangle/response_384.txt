Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor of Node 3 is Node 6. No triangle can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
