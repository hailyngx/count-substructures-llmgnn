Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they include nodes with smaller numbers than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they include nodes with smaller numbers than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they include nodes with smaller numbers than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5 to 9:
    * Skip due to the smaller total node count.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
