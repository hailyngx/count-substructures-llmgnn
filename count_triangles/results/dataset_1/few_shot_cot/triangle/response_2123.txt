Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle with node 3.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, 8)

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are connected, forming a triangle with node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle formed with nodes 3, 5, 8)

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, forming a triangle with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, 9)

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [3].
