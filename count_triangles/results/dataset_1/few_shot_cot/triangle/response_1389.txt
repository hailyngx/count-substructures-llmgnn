Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles by considering each node and its neighbors. 

    * Node 0:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 4.

    * Node 5:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

    * Node 7:
        No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

    * Node 8:
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4.

    Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
