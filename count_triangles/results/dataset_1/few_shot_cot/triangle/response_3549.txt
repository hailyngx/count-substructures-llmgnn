Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the provided example, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * No triangle formed around Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * No triangle formed around Node 5.

Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * No triangle formed around Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider that form a triangle.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider that form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>]
