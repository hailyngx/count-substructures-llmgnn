Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 2), but since 1 and 2 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 5), but since 2 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since 4 and 9 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
