Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's calculate the total number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1, 8, and 7 form a triangle <1, 8, 7>.
        * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3, 7, and 1 form a triangle <3, 7, 1>.
        * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

    Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
