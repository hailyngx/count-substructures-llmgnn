Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
