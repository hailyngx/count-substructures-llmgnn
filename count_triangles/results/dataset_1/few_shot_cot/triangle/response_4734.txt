Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms triangle with node 4 as (3, 4) and (4, 0) are in the edge list.
  * It forms 1 triangle.
  <0, 3, 4>

* Node 1:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
