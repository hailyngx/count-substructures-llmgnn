Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they either have too few 1-hop neighbors or do not have any 1-hop neighbors greater than the node itself.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
