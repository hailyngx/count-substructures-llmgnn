Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not connected because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no 1-hop neighbors for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors for which triangles could be formed since all other 1-hop neighbors are smaller than Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
