Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Skipped as the nodes 1 and 2 are not greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the given edge list (2, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the given edge list (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the given edge list (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 because they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the given edge list (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes except (6, 7) and (6, 2).
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the given edge list (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes except (8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

The triangles found:
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 7>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5 triangles] in the given graph.
