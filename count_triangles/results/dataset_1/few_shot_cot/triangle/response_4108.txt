Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
  * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
