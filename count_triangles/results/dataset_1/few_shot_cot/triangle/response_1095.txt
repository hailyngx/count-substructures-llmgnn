Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [9].
