Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example shown earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
