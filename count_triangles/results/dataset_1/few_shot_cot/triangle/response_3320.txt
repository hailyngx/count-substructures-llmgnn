Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
