Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output is [4].
