Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No additional triangles can be formed starting from Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles involving Node 2 can be formed since all potential pairs are with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles involving Node 4 can be formed since all potential pairs are with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed starting from Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles involving Node 7 can be formed since all potential pairs are with smaller-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
