Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step instructions provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because each of these nodes lacks at least 2 nodes numerically greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
