Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as the neighbors of 1 are smaller than 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as the neighbors of 3 are smaller than 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * There are no triangles possible with these nodes as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of these.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, and <2, 4, 5>.
