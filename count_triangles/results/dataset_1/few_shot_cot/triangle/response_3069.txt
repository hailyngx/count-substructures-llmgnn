Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step and node-by-node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with a node smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
