Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs available. No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs available. No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs available. No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs available. No more triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs available. No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
