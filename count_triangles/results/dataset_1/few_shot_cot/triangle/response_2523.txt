Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's identify the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle can be formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed <2, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed <1, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no connected 2-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no connected 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 6>] 

Therefore, there are 2 unique triangles in the given graph.
