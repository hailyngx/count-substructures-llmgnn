Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
