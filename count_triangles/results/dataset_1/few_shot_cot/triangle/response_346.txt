Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.  
Triangle formed: <2, 8, 3>
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.  
Triangle formed: <2, 9, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.  
Triangle formed: <3, 6, 9>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.  
Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.  
Triangle formed: <3, 8, 2>
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Moving on.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
