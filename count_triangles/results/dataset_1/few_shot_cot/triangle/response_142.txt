Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip Node 1 and Node 2 as they are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 or Node 6 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 or Node 9 due to lack of suitable higher-numbered neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
