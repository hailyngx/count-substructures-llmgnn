Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
