Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Regarding Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, we can see that there are no triangles that can be formed with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
