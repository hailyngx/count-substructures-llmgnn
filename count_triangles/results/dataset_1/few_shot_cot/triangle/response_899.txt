Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * The only pair we could consider is (0, 1), but since 0 and 1 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped as they donâ€™t have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.  
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <0, 4, 5>]
