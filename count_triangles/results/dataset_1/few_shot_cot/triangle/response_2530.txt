Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
The process to count the triangles in the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges is as follows:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
  - No triangles can be formed as there aren't enough nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
