Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the steps described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected. No third node connected to both 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. No third node connected to both 3 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. No third node connected to both 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * Skip these nodes as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
