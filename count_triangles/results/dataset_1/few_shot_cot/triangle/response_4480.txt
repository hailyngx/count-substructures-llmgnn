Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
