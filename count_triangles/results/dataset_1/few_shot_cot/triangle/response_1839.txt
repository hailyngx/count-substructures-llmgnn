Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 6 or at this step.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 7 or at this step.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
