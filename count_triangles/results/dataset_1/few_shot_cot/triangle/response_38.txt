Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other and are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Nodes 6, 7, 9:
    * No possible triangles with Nodes 6, 7, or 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    
Summarizing the triangles:   
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 5.
