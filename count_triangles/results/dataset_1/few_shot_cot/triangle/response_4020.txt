Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same method as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 0) and (3, 0) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) - Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - No valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No valid pairs to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
