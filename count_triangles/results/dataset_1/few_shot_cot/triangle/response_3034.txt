Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as explained in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 cannot form any triangle as it has no neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 forms a triangle with 4 and 5: <4, 5, 9>
    * Node 9 forms a triangle with 5 and 6: <5, 6, 9>
    * Node 9 forms a triangle with 6 and 7: <6, 7, 9>
    * Node 9 forms a triangle with 4 and 7: <4, 7, 9>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 4
* Unique triangles: <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
