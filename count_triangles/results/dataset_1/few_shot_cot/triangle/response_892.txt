Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
