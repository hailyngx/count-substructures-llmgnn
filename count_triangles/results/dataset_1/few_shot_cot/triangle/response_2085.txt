Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes that are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>]
