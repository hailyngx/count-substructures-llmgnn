Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 3 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed. 
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected in the graph.
    * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node due to the lack of suitable higher numbered nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
