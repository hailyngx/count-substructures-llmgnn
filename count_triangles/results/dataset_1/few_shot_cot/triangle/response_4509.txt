Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
