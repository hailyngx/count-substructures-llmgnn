Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0, 1, 4. <0, 1, 4>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip (0, 1) as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4, 7, 9. <4, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 7, 8, 9. <7, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
