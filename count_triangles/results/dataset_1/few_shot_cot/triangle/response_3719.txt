Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
