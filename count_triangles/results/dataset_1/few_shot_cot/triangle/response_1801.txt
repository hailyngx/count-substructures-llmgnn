Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there should be at least two nodes greater than 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are the same node, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 7), but since 5 is smaller than 7, we skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 and 5 are the same node, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 or 5 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
