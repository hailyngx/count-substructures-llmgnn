Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4: 
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are connected, but they don't have a common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, but they don't have a common 1-hop neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
