Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other pairs available for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes. No other pairs available for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other pairs available for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
