Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 3 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 6 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 8 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 9 as there are none.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
