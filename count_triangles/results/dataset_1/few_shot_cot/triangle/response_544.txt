Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) - Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
