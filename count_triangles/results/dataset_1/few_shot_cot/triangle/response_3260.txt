Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs since they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 8>.
