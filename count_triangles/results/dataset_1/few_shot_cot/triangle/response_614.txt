Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as demonstrated in the initial example:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 5, 7>)

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Combining 3 with 5 and 8 does not form a triangle. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Combining 4 with 7 and 9 does not form a triangle. No triangles formed.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 7. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 8: No triangles can be formed.

* Node 9: No triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
