    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Node 3 and 5 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and 6 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Node 3 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Node 5 and 6 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> Node 5 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 4 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and 8 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 5. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and 9 are connected, and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 9), but since nodes 0 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 6 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are [15] triangles in the given graph.
