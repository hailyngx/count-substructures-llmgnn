Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 or 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
