Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example, here is the count of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are not 1-hop neighbors as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs as they involve Nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 4, and they are also connected as (5, 3) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as they do not meet the criteria of having at least 2 nodes with higher numbers to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
