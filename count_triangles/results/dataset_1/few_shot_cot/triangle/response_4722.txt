Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2, 3, 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as they have no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 9 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
