Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of 6 that are directly connected.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of 7 that are directly connected.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of 8 that are directly connected.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
