Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
