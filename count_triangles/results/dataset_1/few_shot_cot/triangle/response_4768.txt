Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
