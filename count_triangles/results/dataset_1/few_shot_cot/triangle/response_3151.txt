Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list. No third node connected to both. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 other nodes greater than 1. No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 other nodes greater than 3. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 other nodes greater than 4. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 other nodes greater than 6. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least 2 other nodes greater than 7. No triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than their values.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
