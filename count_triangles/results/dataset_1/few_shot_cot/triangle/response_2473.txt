Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
