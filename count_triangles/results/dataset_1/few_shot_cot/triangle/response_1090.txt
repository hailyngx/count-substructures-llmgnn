Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 9}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1: 
    * Similar to above as we did with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Similar to above as we did with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
[<0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, <4, 5, 8>]  

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.  
The final answer is [5].
