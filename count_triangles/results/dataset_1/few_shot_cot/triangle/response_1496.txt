Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle <0, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle <0, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider, as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pair with Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Connected, forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> Connected, forms a triangle <2, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle <2, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle <2, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with 0, 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Connected, forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the overall number of triangles in the graph:
Sum of triangles for each node: 2 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
