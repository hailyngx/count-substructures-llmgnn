Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the approach shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 6), but since 2 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
