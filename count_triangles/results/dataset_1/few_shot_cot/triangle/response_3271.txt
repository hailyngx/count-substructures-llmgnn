Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair with neighbors 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * All pairs with Node 2 are already covered through other nodes in the process.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with neighbors 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with neighbors 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No other neighbors to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 7 and 4 is a neighbor of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors other than Node 4 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
