Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 (already covered), as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
