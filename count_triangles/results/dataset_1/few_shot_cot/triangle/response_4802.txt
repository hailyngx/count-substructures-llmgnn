Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 7) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 5: (5, 6) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (5, 7) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 8: (6, 7) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 9: (6, 8) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (7, 8) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip all pairs as they involve a node smaller than 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
