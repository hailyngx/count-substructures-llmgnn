Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
