Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not enough nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are not enough nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
