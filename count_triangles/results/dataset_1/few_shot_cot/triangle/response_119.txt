Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 2), but since 2 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
