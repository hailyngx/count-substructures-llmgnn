Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8:
            * Skipped as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
