Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, we will count the number of triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
