Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * The pairs that can form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node are all not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Similar to Node 1, the pairs that can form triangles are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5, 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Similar to Node 5, no triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair that can form a triangle is (4, 5), but this pair is skipped due to the smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
