Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

2. Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1.

3. Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

4. Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

5. Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

6. Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

7. Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

8. Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

9. Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

10. Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = [3].

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>.
