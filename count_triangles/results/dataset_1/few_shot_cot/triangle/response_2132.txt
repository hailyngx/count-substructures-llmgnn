Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
