Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected because (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
