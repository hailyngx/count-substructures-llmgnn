Response:
Following the step-by-step approach explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 6), but since 5 and 6 are both smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Following similar steps for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there isn't at least 1 node greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
