Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No feasible triangles due to size constraints of other nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped due to size constraints.

* Node 7:
    * No feasible triangles due to size constraints of other nodes. No triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to size constraints.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) +  0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.
