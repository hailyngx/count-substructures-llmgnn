Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph using the process described in the previous example. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
