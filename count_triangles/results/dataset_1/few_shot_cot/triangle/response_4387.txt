Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [9].
