Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (7, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7 because (9, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs to check for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
