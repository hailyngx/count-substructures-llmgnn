Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No more pairs can be considered as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * No more pairs can be considered for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No more pairs can be considered for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
