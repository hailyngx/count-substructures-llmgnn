Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as it has only one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2 as all combinations with smaller nodes have been covered.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 as all combinations with smaller nodes have been covered.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6 as all combinations with smaller nodes have been covered.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7 as all combinations with smaller nodes have been covered.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as it does not have any 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
