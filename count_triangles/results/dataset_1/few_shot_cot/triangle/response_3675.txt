Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, the triangles in the given graph are calculated as follows:

* Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
