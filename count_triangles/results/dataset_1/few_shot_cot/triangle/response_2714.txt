Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected in the edge list. But 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected in the edge list. And both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected in the edge list. But 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list. And both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected in the edge list. But 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
