Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 6:
    * Only one node to form a triangle with, hence no triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, we summarize the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
