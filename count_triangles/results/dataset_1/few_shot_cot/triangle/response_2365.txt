Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected.
    Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected.
    Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are not connected.
    Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but are not connected.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
