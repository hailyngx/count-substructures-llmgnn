Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No valid pairs due to smaller numbered nodes having no connections with each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs due to smaller numbered nodes having no connections with each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs due to smaller numbered nodes having no connections with each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs due to smaller numbered nodes having no connections with each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. No other 1-hop neighbor pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
