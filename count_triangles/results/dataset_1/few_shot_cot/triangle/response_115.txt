Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
