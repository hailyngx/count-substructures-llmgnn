Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, but 3, 5, and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
