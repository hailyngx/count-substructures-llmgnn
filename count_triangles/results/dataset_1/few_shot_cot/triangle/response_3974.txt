Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by following the process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) 
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph: <0, 3, 6>.
