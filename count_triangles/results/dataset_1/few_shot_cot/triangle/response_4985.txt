Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
