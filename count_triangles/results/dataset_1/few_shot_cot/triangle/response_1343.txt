Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. 
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No more nodes to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
