Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 5) and (1, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No edges connected to Node 2, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Triangles involving Node 4:
        * (1, 5, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
