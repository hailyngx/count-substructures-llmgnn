Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 0.

* Node 1:
  * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 3.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No more pairs to consider with Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 2 or 6 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 2 or 9 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 3 or 5 as they are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
