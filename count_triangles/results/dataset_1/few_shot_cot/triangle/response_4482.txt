Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 1 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs, as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
