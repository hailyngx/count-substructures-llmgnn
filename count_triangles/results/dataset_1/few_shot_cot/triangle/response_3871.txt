Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method explained in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9) = 1.

Therefore, [1] triangle is found in the given graph.

The unique triangle found is <7, 4, 9>.
