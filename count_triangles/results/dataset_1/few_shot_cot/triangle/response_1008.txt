Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 4 as it is smaller than 3, and no other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 6, and no other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 5 as it is smaller than 7, and no other nodes to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
