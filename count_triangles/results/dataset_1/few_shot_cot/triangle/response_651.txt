Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the previous example, let's proceed to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>]
