Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 is the 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (0, 5) and (8, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 is the 1-hop neighbor of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 1 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No neighboring nodes to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
