Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, and they are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
