Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<2, 5, 7>, <5, 8, 3>, <6, 4, 2>, <7, 0, 9>]
Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
