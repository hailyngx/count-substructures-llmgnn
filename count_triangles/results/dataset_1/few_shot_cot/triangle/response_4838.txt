Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the same process as detailed in the example. Let's begin the step-by-step process by counting triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3 -> <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 -> <5, 7, 9>

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
