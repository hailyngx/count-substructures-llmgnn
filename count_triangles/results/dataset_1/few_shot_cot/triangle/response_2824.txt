Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Makes a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Makes a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Makes a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Makes a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
