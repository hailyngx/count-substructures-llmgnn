Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> 6 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 and 7 are directly connected as (7, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> 4 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 3 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <3, 9, 6>, <6, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <8, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>.
