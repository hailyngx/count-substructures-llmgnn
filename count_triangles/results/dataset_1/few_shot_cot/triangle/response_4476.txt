Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No pairs for Node 2, so no triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs for Node 3, so no triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs for Node 4, so no triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs for Node 5, so no triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs for Node 6, so no triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> Both 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs for Node 8, so no triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No pairs for Node 9, so no triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7)  = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
