Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 7. No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 8. No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
