Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Empty neighbor set, hence no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Empty neighbor set, hence no triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 8.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 9.
    * No more pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
