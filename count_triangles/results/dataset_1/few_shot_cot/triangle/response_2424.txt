Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [1] - as there is one triangle in the given graph, namely the triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 4.
