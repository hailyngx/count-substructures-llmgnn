Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
