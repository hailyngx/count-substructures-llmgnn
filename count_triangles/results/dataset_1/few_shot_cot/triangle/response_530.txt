Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 7>.
