Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no two distinct 1-hop neighbors to Node 2 that are connected.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no two distinct 1-hop neighbors to Node 5 that are connected.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs left to consider. No triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
