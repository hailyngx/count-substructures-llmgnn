Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed as nodes 2, 3, and 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed as nodes 3, 8, and 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed as nodes 3, 4, and 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed as nodes 3, 5, and 2.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed as nodes 3, 9, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed as nodes 4, 8, and 3.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed as nodes 4, 9, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed as nodes 4, 9, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed as nodes 6, 7, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.

Inside brackets you will list each unique triangle found exactly once such as <0, 2, 3> and <3, 4, 2> etc.
