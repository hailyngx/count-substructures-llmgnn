Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share a common neighbor 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because they do not share a common neighbor 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves.

Let's continue the process for Nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
