Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there isn't at least 1 node greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
