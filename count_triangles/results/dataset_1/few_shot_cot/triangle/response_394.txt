Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since these nodes have neighbors greater than themselves, they do not form triangles themselves. So, no need to proceed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<4, 0, 7>, <5, 7, 8>]
