Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as Node 1 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as Node 2 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as Node 3 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as Node 5 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as Node 6 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as Node 7 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as Node 9 does not have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than itself.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
