Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Nodes 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> Nodes 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2, which are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
