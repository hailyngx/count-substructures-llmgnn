Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the graph. 

* Node 0:
    1. Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    2. Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    3. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    1. Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    2. Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    3. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, 3, 4, 5:
    - Skipped as they are smaller than or equal to Node 6.

* Node 6:
    1. Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    2. Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    3. Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    4. Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    5. Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 7:
    1. Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (0, 6) in the edge list.
    2. Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    3. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    1. Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    2. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    1. Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    2. Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    3. Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    4. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
