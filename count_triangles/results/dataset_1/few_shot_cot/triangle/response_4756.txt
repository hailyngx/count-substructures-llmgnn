Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
[0, 4, 9], [1, 3, 8], [4, 6, 7], [4, 9, 0], [5, 7, 8] 
There are 5 triangles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
