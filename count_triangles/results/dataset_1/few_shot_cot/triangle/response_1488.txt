Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, we will now go through each node to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (4, 8) and (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
