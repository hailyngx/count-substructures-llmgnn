Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's count the triangles for each of the nodes in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Connected to 4 and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Connected to 5 and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Connected to 9 and both are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle possible as 2 is not a neighbor of 3.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle possible as 2 is not a neighbor of 7.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle possible as 2 is not a neighbor of 8.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle possible as 2 is not a neighbor of 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Connected to 5 and 7 and both are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 8), but since 7 and 8 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
