Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 0 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle can be formed with node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle can be formed with node 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle can be formed with node 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle can be formed with node 7 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
