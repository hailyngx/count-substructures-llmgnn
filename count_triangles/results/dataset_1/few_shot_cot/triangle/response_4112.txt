Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 4 and 5:
  - Skipped as they have no connections to form triangles.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
  - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
  - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
