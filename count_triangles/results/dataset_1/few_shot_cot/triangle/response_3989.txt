Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any other pairs with Node 0 as one of the nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as Node 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip any other pairs with Node 3 as one of the nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 2, and 9:
    * Skipped as they have no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 or 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
