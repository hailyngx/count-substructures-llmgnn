Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected as (2, 7). No additional nodes to complete the triangle.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
