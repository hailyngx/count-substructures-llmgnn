Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Triangle: <6, 8, 9>

* Node 7:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Triangle: No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are inside brackets: [<6, 8, 9>]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
