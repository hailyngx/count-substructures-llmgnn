Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed as no valid pairs exist.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed as no valid pairs exist.

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed as no valid pairs exist.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed as no valid pairs exist.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed as no valid pairs exist.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
