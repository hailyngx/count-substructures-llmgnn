Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
        * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip pair 1 as it includes Node 1, which is smaller than Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip pairs involving nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected. 
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
        * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph: [3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
