Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 6, 9:
    * Skipped because they have no connections to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
