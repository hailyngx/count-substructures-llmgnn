Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6  

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
