Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, below is the count of triangles for each node in the given graph along with the final count of triangles in the entire graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller. 
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. 
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
