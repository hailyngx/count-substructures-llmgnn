Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) → Skipped, 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) → Skipped, 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Pair 3 (1, 8) → Skipped, 8 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) → 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) → 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) → 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) → 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) → Skipped, 9 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 or Node 5 as they don't have any neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) → 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) → 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as they have fewer than 2 neighbors greater than themselves.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

Triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
