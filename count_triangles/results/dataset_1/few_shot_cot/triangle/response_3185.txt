Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the method described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
