Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not a triangle because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle because 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle because 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle because 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
