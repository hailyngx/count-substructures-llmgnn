Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 5), but since 5 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
