Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Continuing with the process outlined in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8:
    * Skipped because they have no possible triangles with at least two greater numbered nodes.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Possible triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
