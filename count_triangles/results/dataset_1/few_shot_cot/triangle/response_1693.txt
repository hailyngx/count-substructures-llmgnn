Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (8, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than any of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
