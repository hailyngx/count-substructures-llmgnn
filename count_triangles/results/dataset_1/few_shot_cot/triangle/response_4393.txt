Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the example step-by-step process described earlier, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no direct edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: Skip (4, 8) as 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but there is no direct edge between them.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

We will continue with Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in the same manner.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there are not enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
