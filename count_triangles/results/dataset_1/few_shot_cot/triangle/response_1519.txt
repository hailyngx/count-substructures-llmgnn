Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [2].
