Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected directly as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected directly as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with larger nodes as there are none.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected directly as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * No edges connected to Node 5, so no triangles are possible.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes as the goal is to find triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
  * Since there are no edges connected to Nodes 8 and 9, no triangles are possible with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
