Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed because the edge (1, 2) is not in the list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed because the edge (1, 3) is not in the list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are connected in the edge list as (1, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because the edge (7, 9) is not in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed because the edge (6, 8) is not in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are connected in the edge list as (6, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed because the edge (5, 8) is not in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed because the edge (8, 9) is not in the list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and are connected in the edge list as (9, 0).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
