Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
