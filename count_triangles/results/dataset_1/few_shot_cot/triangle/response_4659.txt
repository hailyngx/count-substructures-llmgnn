Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's identify the number of triangles and the unique triangles formed in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Now we need to find the third node that completes the triangle.
                * Checking 1-hop neighbors, we find 1 and 8 are connected, completing the triangle. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Already considered when processing Node 1, so skip.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 4:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 6:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Now we need to find the third node that completes the triangle.
                * Checking 1-hop neighbors, we find 6 and 7 are connected, completing the triangle. Triangle: <6, 7, 8>
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

        [2] - the number of triangles in the graph.  
        [<1, 2, 8>, <6, 7, 8>] - the unique triangles found in the graph.
