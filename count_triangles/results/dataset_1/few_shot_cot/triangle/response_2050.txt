Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, we will count the number of triangles in the graph with the given nodes, edges, and adjacency lists.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Not connected, No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 6) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Not connected, No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Not connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both are 1-hop neighbors and connected, No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
