Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor of 1 is connected to both 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor of 3 is connected to both 1 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor of 3 is connected to both 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: No pairs to check for Node 4 since all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to check for Node 5 as there are no other nodes connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are connected. No other 1-hop neighbor of 6 is connected to both 3 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to check for Node 7 as there are no other nodes connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to check for Node 8 as all other nodes are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to check for Node 9 as there are no other nodes connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
