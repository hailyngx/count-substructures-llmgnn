Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are directly connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
The triangles found are:
[<1, 2, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <8, 6, 9>]
