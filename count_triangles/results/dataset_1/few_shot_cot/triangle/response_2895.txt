Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
