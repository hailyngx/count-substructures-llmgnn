Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes. No remaining pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes. No remaining pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No remaining pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
