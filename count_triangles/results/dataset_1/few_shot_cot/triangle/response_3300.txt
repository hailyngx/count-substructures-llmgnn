Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example with the given graph, we count the number of triangles:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 does not have any neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 3 only has one neighbor.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 4 only has one neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7)- Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it only has one neighbor.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 9 only has two neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
