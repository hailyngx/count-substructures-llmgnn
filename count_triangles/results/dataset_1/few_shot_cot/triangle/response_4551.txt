Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes greater than 9, so no triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
