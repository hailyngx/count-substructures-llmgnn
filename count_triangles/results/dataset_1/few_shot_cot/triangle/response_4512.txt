Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other possible triangles involving Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other possible triangles involving Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles involving Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - No other possible triangles involving Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No possible triangles involving Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
