Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 2-hop neighbors and finding the triangles formed:

* Node 0:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 0.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - No triangles formed with 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles formed with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles formed with 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles formed with 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with 8 as the smallest numbered node since there is no node greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    - No triangle can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
