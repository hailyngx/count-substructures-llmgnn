Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of Node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no suitable pairs involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no suitable pairs involving Node 3.

* Node 4: No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 6 as it is smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no suitable pairs involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 1, 2, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no suitable pairs involving Node 8.

* Node 9: No triangles can be formed as it has no pairs with 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
