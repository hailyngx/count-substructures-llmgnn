Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the provided example step-by-step to determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
