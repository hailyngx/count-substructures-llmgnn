Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
