Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Triangle formed with nodes 7, 8, and 2. <7, 8, 2>
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
