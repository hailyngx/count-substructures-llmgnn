Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided earlier, here is how we identify and count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
