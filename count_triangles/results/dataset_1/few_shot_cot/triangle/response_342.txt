Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skipped as it has no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
