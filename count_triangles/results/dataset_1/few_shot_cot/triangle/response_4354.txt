Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the procedure outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 1) -> 2 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
