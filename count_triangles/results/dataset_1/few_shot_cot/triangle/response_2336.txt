Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <0, 4, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes smaller than 2. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles: <2, 7, 9>

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2
