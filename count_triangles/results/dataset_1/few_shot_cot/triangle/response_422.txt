1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * No triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  * No triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  * No triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
