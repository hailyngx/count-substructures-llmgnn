Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No pairs to consider as these nodes don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 2. 

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
