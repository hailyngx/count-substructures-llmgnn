    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed involving Node 2. No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * As Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
