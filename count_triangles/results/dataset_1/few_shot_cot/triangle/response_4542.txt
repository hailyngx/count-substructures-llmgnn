Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example for each node in the given graph, here are the triangles formed:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with the smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0
Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
