Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the example given, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> Connected through (3, 5). Triangle formed (<0, 3, 5>).
    * Pair 9: (3, 6) -> Connected through (3, 6). Triangle formed (<0, 3, 6>).
    * Pair 10: (5, 6) -> Connected through (5, 6). Triangle formed (<0, 5, 6>).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected through (7, 9). Triangle formed (<2, 7, 9>).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Connected through (5, 6). Triangle formed (<3, 5, 6>).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Connected through (7, 9). Triangle formed (<6, 7, 9>).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * None of these nodes have at least two 1-hop neighbors greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
