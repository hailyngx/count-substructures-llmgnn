Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
