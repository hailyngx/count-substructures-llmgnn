Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 0. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, thus no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, thus no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 2. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and also connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 4. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 5. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 6. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs with nodes greater than 7. Skip.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Only nodes 1 and 5 are greater than 8 and 9, but they are not enough to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
