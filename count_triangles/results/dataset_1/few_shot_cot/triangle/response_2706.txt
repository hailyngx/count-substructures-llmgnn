Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as illustrated in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No possible pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
