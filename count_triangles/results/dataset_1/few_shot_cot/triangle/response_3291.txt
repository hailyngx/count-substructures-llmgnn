Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will identify the triangles in the given graph. 

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip the pair (0, 4) as it was already counted when analyzing Node 0.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>.
    - Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than Node 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
