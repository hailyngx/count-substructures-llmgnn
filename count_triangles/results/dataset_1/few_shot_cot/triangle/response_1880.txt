Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's find and count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <2, 5, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs since there are no higher-numbered nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5: <4, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [4].
