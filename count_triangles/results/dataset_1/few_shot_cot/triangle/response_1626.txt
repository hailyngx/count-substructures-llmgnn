Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs for Node 1 as there are no pairs that include a node greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs for Node 2 as there are no pairs that include a node greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs for Node 4 as there are no pairs that include a node greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed starting from these nodes as there are no pairs where both nodes are greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0 for each node

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
