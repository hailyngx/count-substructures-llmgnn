Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions given in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Form Triangle <0, 3, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Form Triangle <1, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Form Triangle <3, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Form Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Form Triangle <5, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, and <5, 6, 7>.
