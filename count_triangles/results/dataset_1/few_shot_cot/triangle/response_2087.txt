Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 0 and Node 3 are both 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 1, Node 4, and Node 5 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected in the graph. Triangle formed <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Node 1 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and are connected in the graph. Triangle formed <3, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Node 3, Node 4, and Node 6 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller nodes.
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only possible triangle is <5, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 5> and <3, 4, 5> and <5, 6, 7>.
