Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided and considering each node from 0 to 9:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No edge between 2 and 4, so no triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No edge between 2 and 7, so no triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No edge between 2 and 8, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No edge between 4 and 6, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> No edge between 6 and 3, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No edge between 5 and 7, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No edge between 8 and 9, so no triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
