Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as (1, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 as it is greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as no other node is greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 and are connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the given graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, [5] triangles are in the given graph.

The unique triangles are: <3, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 8, 3>, <3, 9, 8>, <5, 6, 9>.
