Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 3) because Node 0 is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair (0, 6) because Node 0 is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair (0, 3) because Node 0 is smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <8, 3, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
