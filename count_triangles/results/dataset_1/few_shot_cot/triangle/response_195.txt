Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as Node 0 has only 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as Node 1 has only 1 neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 is connected to 8 but not a direct neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 is connected to 8 but not a direct neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipped as Node 3 has no neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 4. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 is connected to 9 but not a direct neighbor. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected but not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as Node 5 has only 1 neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected and both are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as Node 7 is directly connected to all its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: Skipped as Node 8 is directly connected to all its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as Node 9 is directly connected to all its 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
