Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Both 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it's smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
