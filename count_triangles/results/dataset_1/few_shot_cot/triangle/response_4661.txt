Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph using each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no (4, 6) edge in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected. The triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No other pairs to consider. No additional triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving other nodes. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 2.
    * No other pairs to consider. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
