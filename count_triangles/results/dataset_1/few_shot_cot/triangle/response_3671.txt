Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
