Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same process as the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) - Triangle formed by nodes 0, 1, and 7.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Triangle formed by nodes 0, 1, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 6.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 7.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 8.
    * Pair 6: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between nodes 3 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Triangle formed by nodes 2, 5, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pair combinations as there are no nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Triangle formed by nodes 4, 5, and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Triangle formed by nodes 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they have no pairs to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
