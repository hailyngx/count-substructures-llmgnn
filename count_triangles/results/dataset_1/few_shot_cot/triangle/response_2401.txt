Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 and 7:
    * Skipped because Node 6 has no connections and Node 7 doesn't have enough larger nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
