Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 3) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    * No possible triangle formation for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    * No possible triangle formation for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    * No possible triangle formation for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
