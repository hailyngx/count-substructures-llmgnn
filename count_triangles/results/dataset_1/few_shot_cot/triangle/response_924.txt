Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 5, 8>)

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, the final answer is [1].
