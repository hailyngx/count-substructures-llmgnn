Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 2) -> 8 and 2 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
