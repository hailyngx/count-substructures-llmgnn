Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
