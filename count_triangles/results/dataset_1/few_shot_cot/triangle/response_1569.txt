Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided and counting triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        
* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 for all other nodes = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
