Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Form a triangle with 1 and 3.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Form a triangle with 1 and 5.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Form a triangle with 1 and 8.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip pair with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with 7 and 8.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Form a triangle with 3 and 4.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Form a triangle with 4 and 9.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 9 are not directly connected.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No more pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
