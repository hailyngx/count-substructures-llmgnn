Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as 0 is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as 0 is smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
