Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the example of counting triangles step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangle is formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle is formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No edges connected to Node 5, so no triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle is formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 3 are also connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No edges connected to Node 8, so no triangles are formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle is formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
