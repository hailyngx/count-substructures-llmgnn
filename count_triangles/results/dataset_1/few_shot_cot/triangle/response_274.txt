Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than all the other nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than nodes with which they could form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
