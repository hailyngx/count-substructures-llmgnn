Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No valid triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
