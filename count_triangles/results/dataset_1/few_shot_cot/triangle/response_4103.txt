Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * No other pairs to consider.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No other pairs to consider.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
