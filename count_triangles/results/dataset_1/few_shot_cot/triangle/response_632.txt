Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 4, 6>

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has only 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it has only 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles involving Node 6: <6, 7, 9>

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has only 1-hop neighbor.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>]
