Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 1 and 6 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with 1 and 8 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 1 and 9 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 6 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 7 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 9 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 4 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 8 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 7 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and also directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 9 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 5 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 0 and 8 since they are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
