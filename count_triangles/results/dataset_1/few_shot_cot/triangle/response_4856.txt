Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No connections, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles involving Node 3 due to limited connections.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles involving Node 5 due to limited connections.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles involving Node 6 due to limited connections.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped due to limited connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3)  + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
