Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with a single node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
