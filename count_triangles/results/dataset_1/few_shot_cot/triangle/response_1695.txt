Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8, 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
