Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 0 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
