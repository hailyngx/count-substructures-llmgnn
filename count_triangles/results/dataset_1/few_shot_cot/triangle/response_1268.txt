Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle formed with Node 9 as there are no edges connected to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
