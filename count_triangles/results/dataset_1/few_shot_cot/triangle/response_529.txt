Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method used in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected, but 1 is not connected to 4 directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * All pairs involving Node 0 are skipped since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected, but 2 is not connected to 7 directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but 2 is not connected to 9 directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both connected and adjacent to each other. Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * All other pairs include nodes that are not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * All other pairs include nodes that are not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * All other pairs include nodes that are not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 0, but no other nodes to form triangles. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair involves Node 8 which is greater than 6 but not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 7.
    * All other pairs include nodes that are not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * The only pair involves Node 9 which is greater than 8 but not connected directly. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * All other pairs include nodes that are not connected directly. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
