Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same method as explained in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 2) and (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (7, 3) and (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 5) and (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 6) and (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (2, 7) and (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
