Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Both 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Both 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (1, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
