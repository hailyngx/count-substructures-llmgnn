Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}
