Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, 3, 4:
    * No edges connected to these nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
