Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    - No more pairs for Node 1 as the other possible pairs have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No more pairs for Node 2 as the other possible pairs have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No more pairs for Node 3 as the other possible pairs have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No more pairs for Node 4 as the other possible pairs have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 and are also connected in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No more pairs for Node 7 as the other possible pairs have smaller numbered nodes.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there are no pairs left with nodes larger than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [5].
