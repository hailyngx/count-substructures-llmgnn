Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7:
    * Skipped as they are smaller than the available pairs.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
