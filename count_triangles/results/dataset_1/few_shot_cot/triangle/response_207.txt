Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  - Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
  - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
