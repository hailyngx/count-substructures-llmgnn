Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 0 are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * No other pairs to consider as they involve smaller nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * No triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 4:
  * We can skip all pairs involving smaller nodes.
  * No triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * No other pairs to consider as they involve smaller nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node since all other connected nodes are smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
