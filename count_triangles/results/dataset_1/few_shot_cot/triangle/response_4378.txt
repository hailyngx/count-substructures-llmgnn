Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
