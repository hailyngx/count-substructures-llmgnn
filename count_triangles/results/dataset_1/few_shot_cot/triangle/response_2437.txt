Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the method provided in the example, let's start counting the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    - No neighbors to form triangles with. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No more pairs can be considered.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [7].
