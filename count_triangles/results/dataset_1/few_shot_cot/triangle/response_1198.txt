Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described before, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Part of the triangle <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Part of the triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Part of the triangle <3, 6, 9>.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 6), but since 2 and 6 are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
