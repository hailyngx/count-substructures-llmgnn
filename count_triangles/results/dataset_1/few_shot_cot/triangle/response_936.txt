Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Alright, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are greater than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5 as they are greater than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
