Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough connections.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are not enough connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
