Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are directly connected as (0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are directly connected as (1, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected as (1, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are directly connected as (2, 7).
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8).
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected as (2, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected as (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 11

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
