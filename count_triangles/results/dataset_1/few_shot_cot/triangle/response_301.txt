1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6 and Node 7:
            * No 2-hop triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6 or 7.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip as there isn't another node greater than 8 to form a triangle.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

        Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
