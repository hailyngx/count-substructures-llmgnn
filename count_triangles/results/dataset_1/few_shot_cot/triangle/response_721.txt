1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected. (1, 4) exists in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected. (4, 8) exists in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (formed by nodes 0, 1, and 4)

*Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 since (1, 4) was already taken into account.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 1.

*Node 2:
    * Skip pair with Node 3 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected. (2, 4) exists in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 2.

*Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected. (4, 5) exists in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 3.

*Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected. (4, 8) exists in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 4.

*Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

*Node 6:
    * Not enough nodes for Node 6 to form a triangle.

*Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 7.

*Node 8:
    * Skip pair that includes Node 9 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected. (8, 9) exists in the edge list.
    * No additional triangles involving Node 8.

*Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

The final answer is [1].
