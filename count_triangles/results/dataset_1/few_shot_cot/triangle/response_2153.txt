Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the previous example, let's count the triangles for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
