Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> All nodes are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> All nodes are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 6), but since 5 and 6 are not directly connected, no triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * All possible pairs are covered under Node 2, so no additional triangles involving Node 5 can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * All possible pairs are covered under Node 1 and Node 2, so no additional triangles involving Node 6 can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> All nodes are connected. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, and <7, 8, 9>.
