Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
            * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
