Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1, as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
