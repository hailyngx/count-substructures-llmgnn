Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * We can skip all pairs involving Node 0 since 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * We can skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 6 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * We can skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 since they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected as (7, 5) in the edge list. No third node connected to both 7 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * All pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * All pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * All pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * All pairs with smaller nodes are skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as no pair can be formed with two nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
