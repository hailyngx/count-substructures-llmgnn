    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) = 5. 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
