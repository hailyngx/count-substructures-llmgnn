Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process for counting triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7 and Node 1 <0, 1, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0 or 1 because they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 because they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 because they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 because they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 because they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are connected forming a triangle with Node 6 <3, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 because they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 because they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any triangle that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 because they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 <1, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
