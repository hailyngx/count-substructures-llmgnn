Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same process as the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
