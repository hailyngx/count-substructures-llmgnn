1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node in the graph provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are also directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 4>.
        * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 6>.
        * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1. They are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are also directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 5, 8>.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4. They are also directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 5, 8>.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. They are also directly connected as (1, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 6, 9>.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. They are also directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 9>.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7. They are also directly connected as (0, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 7>.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9. They are also directly connected as (0, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 4, 9>.
        * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 9>.
The final answer is [8].
