Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs, as they include nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs, as they include nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs, as they include nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
