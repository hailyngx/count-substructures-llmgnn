Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the initial example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
      
[<2, 3, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 9>, <4, 8, 0>]
