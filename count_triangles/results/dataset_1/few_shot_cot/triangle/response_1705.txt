Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (1, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Both 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (1, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
