Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed since 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed since 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - No triangle formed since 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - No triangle formed since 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) - No triangle formed since 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) - No triangle formed since 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4) as they involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Triangle formed as 4 and 5 are connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - No triangle formed since 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed since 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Triangle formed as 7 and 8 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles to form with other nodes larger than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
