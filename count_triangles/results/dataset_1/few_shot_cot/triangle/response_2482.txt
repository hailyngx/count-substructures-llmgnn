Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (1, 3) because 1 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip pair (1, 6) because 1 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair (1, 4) because 1 is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: 
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 or 0 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
