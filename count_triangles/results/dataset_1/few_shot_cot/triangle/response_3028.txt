Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process demonstrated in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 3 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 is counted in the triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is counted in the triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<1, 3, 4>] 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
