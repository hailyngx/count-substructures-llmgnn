Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined earlier, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5 as they are greater than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 6 as they are greater than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is greater than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 9 as they are greater than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it is greater than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
