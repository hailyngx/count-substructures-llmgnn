Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped because it has no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
