Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skipped all pairs involving Node 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skipped all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) - 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 4 are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipped all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 7 are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skipped all pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) - 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
