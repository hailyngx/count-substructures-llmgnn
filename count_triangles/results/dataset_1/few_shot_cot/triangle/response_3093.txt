Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
