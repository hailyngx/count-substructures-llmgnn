Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
