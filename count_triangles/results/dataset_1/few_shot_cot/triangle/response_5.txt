Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 9 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 5), but since 6 is smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 9 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
