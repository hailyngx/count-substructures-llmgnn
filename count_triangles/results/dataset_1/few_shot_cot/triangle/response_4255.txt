Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as no pairs are available.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as no pairs are available.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pair with Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * No other pairs available for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs available for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 cannot form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs available for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
