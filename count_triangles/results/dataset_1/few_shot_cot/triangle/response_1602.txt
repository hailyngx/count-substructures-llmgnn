Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
   - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
   - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
   - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
   - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
   - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Does not form a triangle.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
   - No more pairs left to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
   - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
   - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
   - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <6, 8, 9>.
