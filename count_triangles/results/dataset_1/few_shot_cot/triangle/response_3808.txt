Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles possible with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

So the output of the final answer inside brackets would be: [0].
