Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 due to smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 due to smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7 due to smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 8 due to smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
