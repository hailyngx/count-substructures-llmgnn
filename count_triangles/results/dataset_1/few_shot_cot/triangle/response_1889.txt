Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any possible pairs as all other nodes are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any possible pairs as all other nodes are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only possible pair is (6, 9) but they are both greater than 7, so no triangles are formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any possible pairs as all other nodes are greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any possible pairs as all other nodes are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
