Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the same process described in the example with the given graph, here are the counts of triangles formed by each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>
    - Pair 5: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>
    - Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
