Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there is only one edge connected to it.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there is only one edge connected to it.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as each of them has only one edge connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
