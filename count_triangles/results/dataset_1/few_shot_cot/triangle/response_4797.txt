Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not directly connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Par 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

The answer should be [ <0, 1, 9>, <2, 5, 8> ].
