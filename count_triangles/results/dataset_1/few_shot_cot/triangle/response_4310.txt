Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle can be formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 1 as it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 2 as it only has two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 3 as it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 4 as it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 5 as it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 6 as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node since it only has two neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed from Node 9 as it only has one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
