1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method used in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) - Node 1 and Node 4 are connected via edge (1, 4), and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (1, 8) - Node 1 and Node 8 are connected via edge (1, 8), and they are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Node 2 and Node 4 share a common neighbor Node 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Node 4 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected via edge (4, 8). Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Node 3 and Node 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Node 4 and Node 8 are connected via edge (4, 8), but Node 3 is not part of this triangle. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Nodes 8 and 9 are connected via edge (8, 7) and they are 1-hop neighbors of Node 7. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are: 
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>].
