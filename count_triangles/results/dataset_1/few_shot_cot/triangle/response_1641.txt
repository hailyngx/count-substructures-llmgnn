Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The list of unique triangles found is: [<0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 7, 9>]. 

So, the final answer is [3].
