Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
