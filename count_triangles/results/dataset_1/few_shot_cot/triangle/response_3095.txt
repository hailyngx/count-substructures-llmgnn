Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 2 since they are larger.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 since it is larger.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 7 as they are larger than 2.
    * No valid triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 as it is larger than 3.
    * No valid triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 5 since it is larger.
    * No valid triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is larger than 5.
    * No valid triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 9 as it is larger than 7.
    * No valid triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
