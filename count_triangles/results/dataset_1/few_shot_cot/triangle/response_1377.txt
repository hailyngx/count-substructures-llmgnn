Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 2 does not share any edges with its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Skip node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 5 does not share any edges with its 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
