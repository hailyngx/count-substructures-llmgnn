Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has 1-hop neighbor 4 which is smaller.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
