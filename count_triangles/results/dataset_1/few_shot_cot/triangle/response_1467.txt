Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 0.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Does not form a triangle with node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Does not form a triangle with node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Does not form a triangle with node 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Does not form a triangle with node 1.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Does not form a triangle with node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Does not form a triangle with node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> Forms a triangle with node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> Forms a triangle with node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with node 8.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) -> Does not form a triangle with node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
