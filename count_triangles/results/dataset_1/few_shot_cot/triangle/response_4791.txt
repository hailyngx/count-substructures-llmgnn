Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 6) -> This pair is the same as Pair 1, so we skip it.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
