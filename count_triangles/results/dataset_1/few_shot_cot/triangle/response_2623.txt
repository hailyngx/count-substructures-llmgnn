1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Nodes 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Nodes 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Nodes 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 7). One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7). One side of the triangle found.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 9). One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 8). One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Nodes 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (9, 2). One side of the triangle found.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to consider as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 

[<1, 2, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>]
