Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to count triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors because (6, 7) is not in the 1-hop neighbor set of either 6 or 7. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair involving Nodes smaller than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
