Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 5), but since 7 is greater than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 7), but since 9 is greater than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Answer: [ <3, 4, 7> ]
