Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
