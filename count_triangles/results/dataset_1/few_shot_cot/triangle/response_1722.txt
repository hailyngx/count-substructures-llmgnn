Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 8:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
