Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
