Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles with 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no possible triangles with 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there are no possible triangles with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no possible triangles with 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as there are no possible triangles with 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
