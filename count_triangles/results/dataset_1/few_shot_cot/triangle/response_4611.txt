Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Form a triangle with 7 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Form a triangle with 9 and 3.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles for Node 0: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found: 
[<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
