Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example with detailed steps for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 2.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 5.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. They form a triangle with 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
