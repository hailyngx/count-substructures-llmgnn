Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 0 does not have any neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 1 has only one neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 2 has only one neighbor.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 3 does not have any neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 5 has only one neighbor.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No additional triangles can be formed as Node 7 has only two neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 8 has only one neighbor.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 9 does not have any neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the number of triangles in the graph is [1].
