Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * No applicable pairs exist for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue the process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No applicable pairs exist for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No applicable pairs exist for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 - Skipped due to no possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No applicable pairs exist for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
