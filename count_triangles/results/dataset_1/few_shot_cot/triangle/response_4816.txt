Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
