Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 1 at the center.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * There are no possible triangles with Node 3 at the center.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 at the center.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 at the center.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Nodes 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 at the center.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
