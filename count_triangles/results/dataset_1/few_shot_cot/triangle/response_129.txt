Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since there are no additional higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since there are no additional higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since there are no additional higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No potential triangles with any other nodes since there are no additional higher-numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
