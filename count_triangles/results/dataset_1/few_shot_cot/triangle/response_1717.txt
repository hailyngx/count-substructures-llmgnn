Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
