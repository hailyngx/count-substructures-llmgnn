Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but 5 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> 6 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, but 6 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, but 9 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no other connected nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no other connected nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
