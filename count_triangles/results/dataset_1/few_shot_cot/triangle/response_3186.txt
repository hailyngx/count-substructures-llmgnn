Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}
