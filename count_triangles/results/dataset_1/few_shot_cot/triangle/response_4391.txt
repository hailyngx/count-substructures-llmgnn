Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
