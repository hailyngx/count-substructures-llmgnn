Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

- **Node 0**:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- **Node 1**:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- **Node 2**:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 3**:
    - Does not have any neighbors. No triangles formed.

- **Node 4**:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1.
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 5**:
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 6**:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- **Node 7**:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1.
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 8**:
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- **Node 9**:
    - No new triangles are formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
