Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6 and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 5, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
