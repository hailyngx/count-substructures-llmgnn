Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the same method, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7:
    * All these nodes don't form triangles with any larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skipped as there are not at least two nodes greater than Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
