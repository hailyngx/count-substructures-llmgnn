Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    <1, 3, 7>
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    <3, 5, 6> - Formed by nodes 3, 5, and 6.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    <7, 2, 8>
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summing up the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
