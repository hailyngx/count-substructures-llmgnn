Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as shown in the example before, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, as they are larger than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 to Node 9:
    * Skip all nodes with Node numbers less than the current node number as they would have already been considered.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
