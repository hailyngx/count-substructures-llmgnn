Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
        * No possible triangles with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No possible triangles with Node 4.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No possible triangles with Node 5.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No possible triangles with Node 8.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
