Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 1) -> Both 5 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 1 are also directly connected as (5, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
