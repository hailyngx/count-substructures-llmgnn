Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not connected as (5, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 3 as they have been considered in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4 as they have been considered in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5 as they have been considered in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6 as they have been considered in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7 as they have been considered in previous steps.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
