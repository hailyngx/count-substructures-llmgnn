Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 7: <0, 1, 7>
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 1: <0, 3, 1>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 0: <1, 4, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as no pair can form a triangle with 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 4: <3, 5, 4>
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 0: <3, 6, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes have smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as 1, 3, and 4 have smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 3: <6, 4, 3>
    * Pair 2: (7, 2) -> Directly connected. Check for the third connection.
        * Triangle formed with Node 0: <6, 7, 0>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as 0 and 2 have smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes have smaller numbers.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as 0 has a smaller number.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
