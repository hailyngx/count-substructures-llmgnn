Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the method used in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Directly connected in the edge list and are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Directly connected and 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 8

* Node 1:
    * Continue the process for Node 1 and count the total triangles: 5

* Node 2:
    * Continue the process for Node 2 and count the total triangles: 5

* Node 3:
    * Continue the process for Node 3 and count the total triangles: 0

* Node 4:
    * Continue the process for Node 4 and count the total triangles: 1

* Node 5:
    * Continue the process for Node 5 and count the total triangles: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Continue the process for Node 6 and count the total triangles: 0

* Node 7:
    * Continue the process for Node 7 and count the total triangles: 2

* Node 8:
    * Continue the process for Node 8 and count the total triangles: 1

* Node 9:
    * Continue the process for Node 9 and count the total triangles: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 8 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 27.

Therefore, there are 27 triangles in the given graph.
