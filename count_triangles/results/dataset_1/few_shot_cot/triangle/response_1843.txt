Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. They form a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. They form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Thus, the final answer is [2].
