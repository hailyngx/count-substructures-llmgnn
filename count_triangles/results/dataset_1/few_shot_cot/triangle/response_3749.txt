Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 9) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider since no nodes are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than or equal to 6.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
