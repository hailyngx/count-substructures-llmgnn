Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process used in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 0, which is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Only 1-hop neighbor is Node 2, which is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Only 1-hop neighbors are Nodes 2 and 9, which are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Only 1-hop neighbors are Nodes 4 and 6, which are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Only 1-hop neighbors are Nodes 2, 4, and 7, which are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
