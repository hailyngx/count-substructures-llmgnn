Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Since Node 5 does not have at least 2 neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Node 6 has only one neighbor and cannot form a triangle.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Node 8 has a single 1-hop neighbor.
    * Since Node 8 does not have at least 2 neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * Node 9 has a single 1-hop neighbor.
    * Since Node 9 does not have at least 2 neighbors, no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
