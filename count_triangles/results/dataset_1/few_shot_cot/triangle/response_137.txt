Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
   - No pairs to form triangles as no other nodes are greater than 0.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0
   
2. **Node 1:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
   
3. **Node 2:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. **Node 3:**
   - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
   - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list.
   - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
   - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2
   
5. **Node 4:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
   - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs to consider.
   - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
