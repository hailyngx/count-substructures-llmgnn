1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
