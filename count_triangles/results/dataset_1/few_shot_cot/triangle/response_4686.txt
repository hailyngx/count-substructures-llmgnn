Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as demonstrated in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are not at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no other nodes in the graph.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no other nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
