Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
To count the triangles in the given graph, we will examine each node's 1-hop neighbors and their connections. Here we go step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no larger numbered nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3, as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 9, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Lastly, we skip analyzing Nodes 8 and 9 as there are no nodes with higher numbers to form triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
