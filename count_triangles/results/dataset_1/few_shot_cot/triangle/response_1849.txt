Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 1, and 4 <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 6 <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 4, and 9 <1, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 4, 6, and 9 <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
