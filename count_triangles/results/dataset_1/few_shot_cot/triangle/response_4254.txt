Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed since (3, 5) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed since (3, 6) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed since (3, 7) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed since (3, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed since (5, 6) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed since (5, 7) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed since (5, 8) is in the edge list, but 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed since (6, 7) is in the edge list, but 6 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed since (6, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed since (7, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed since (8, 9) is in the edge list, but 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 3, 6>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 6, 7>

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed since (8, 9) is in the edge list, but 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed since (7, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no pairs left with at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
