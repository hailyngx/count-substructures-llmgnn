Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the given information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skipped any pairs with Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped any pairs with Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skipped any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
