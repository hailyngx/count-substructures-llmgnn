Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0: No triangles possible as it has no connections.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2: No triangles possible as it has no connections.

* Node 3: No triangles possible as it does not have enough connections.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5: No triangles possible as it has no connections.

* Node 6: No triangles possible as it does not have enough connections.

* Node 7: No triangles possible as it does not have enough connections.

* Node 8: No triangles possible as it does not have enough connections.

* Node 9: No triangles possible as it does not have enough connections.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
