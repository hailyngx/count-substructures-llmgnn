Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, which is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 2: 
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 5 as they are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>]
