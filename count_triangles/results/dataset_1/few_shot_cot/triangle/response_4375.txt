Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Both 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (1, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 1) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6. No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 5), but since 4 and 5 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped. No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
