Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:
        
* Node 0:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, no possible triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1)
        
Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
