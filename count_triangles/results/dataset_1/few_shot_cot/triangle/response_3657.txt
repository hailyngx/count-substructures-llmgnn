Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}
