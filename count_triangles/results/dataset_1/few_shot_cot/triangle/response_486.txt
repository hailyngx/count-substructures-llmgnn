Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 3 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 2) -> 4 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
