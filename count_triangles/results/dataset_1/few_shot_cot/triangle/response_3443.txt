Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs available as smaller numbered nodes are skipped. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the final answer is [2].
