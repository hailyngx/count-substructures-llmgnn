Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * There are not at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
