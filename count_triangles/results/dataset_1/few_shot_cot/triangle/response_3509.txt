Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 1) -> 1 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 1>.

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1 as it includes Node 0, which is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 6) -> 6 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 6>.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
