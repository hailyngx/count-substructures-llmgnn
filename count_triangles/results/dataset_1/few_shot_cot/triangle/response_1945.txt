Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Forms a triangle with node 5: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - Forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) - Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 1: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (5, 9) - Forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No new triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No new triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
