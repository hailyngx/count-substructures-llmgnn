Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles formed directly with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 2 (smaller) and no other nodes available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 4, 7>].
