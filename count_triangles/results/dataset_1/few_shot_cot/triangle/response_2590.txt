Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
