Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 3 is directly connected as (0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 6 is also a 1-hop neighbor, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 7 is also a 1-hop neighbor, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 8 is also a 1-hop neighbor, and they are directly connected as (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 7 is also a 1-hop neighbor, and they are directly connected as (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, 9 is also a 1-hop neighbor, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are directly connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6, 8 is also a 1-hop neighbor, and they are directly connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
