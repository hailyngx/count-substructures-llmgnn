Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

1. **Node 0**:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. **Node 1**:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2**:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. **Node 4**:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. **Node 5**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. **Node 6**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. **Node 7**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. **Node 8**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. **Node 9**:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
