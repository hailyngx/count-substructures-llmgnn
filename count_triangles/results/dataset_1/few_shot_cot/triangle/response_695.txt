Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - No pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 2)
* There are no triangles involving Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

This calculation involved finding triangles using each node as the starting point and counting the triangles where that node was the smallest numbered node in the triangle.
