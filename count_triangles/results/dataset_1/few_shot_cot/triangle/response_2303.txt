Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No more pairs to check as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will not form any triangles individually.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
