Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
