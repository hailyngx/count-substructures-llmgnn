Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, here is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as it only has one neighbor.

- Node 1:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it only has one neighbor.

- Node 2:
  - Skip pairs containing nodes 0 and 1.
  - Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but not connected in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and connected. 
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No other pairs to consider for Node 4.

- Node 5:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 and connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
  - Skip pairs containing Node 0.
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but not connected in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

- Node 8:
  - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
  - No other pairs to consider for Node 8.

- Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has one neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
