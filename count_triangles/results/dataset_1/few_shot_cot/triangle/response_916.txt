Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. No additional triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
