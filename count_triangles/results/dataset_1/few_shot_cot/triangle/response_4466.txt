Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Based on the calculations above, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are: <6, 7, 0>.
