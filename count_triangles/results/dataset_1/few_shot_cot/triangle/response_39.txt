Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 6

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
  * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 6 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 14.

Therefore, there are [14] triangles in the given graph.
