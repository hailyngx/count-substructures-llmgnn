Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 4 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Node 4 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Node 4 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 8) - Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (5, 9) - Node 5 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (8, 9) - Node 8 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Node 4 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
  * No triangles formed from Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 4 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
  * No other triangles formed from Node 3.

* Node 4:
  * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
  * No other triangles formed from Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
  * No other triangles formed from Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * Skip all pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
  * No other triangles formed from Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed from Node 7.

* Node 8:
  * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0 and 9.
  * No triangles formed from Node 8.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph, which can be represented as [2].
