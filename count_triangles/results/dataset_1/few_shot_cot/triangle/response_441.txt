Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as no 1-hop neighbor of 9 has a higher number.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
