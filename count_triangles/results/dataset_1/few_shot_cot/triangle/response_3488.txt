Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
