Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No valid pairs remaining to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No valid pairs remaining to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs remaining to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No valid pairs remaining to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No valid pairs remaining to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3, and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4 triangles] in the given graph.
