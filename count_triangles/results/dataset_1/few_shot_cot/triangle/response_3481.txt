Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
