Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with no greater numbered nodes to form a triangle with 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with no greater numbered nodes to form a triangle with 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Since there are no edges connected to Node 9, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
