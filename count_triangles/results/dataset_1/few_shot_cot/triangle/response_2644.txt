Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 3 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 2 and 3 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 2 and 8 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 0 and 1 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles found are: [<1, 2, 8>, <0, 7, 8>].

So, the final answer is [2].
