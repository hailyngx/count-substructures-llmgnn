Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 7) -> 7 is a 1-hop neighbor of 4, and there is a self-loop in 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5, 6, 8:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 7>]
