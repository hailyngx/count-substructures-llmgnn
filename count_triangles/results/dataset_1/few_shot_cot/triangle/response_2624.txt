Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
