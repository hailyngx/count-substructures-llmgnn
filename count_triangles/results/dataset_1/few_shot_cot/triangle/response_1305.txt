Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Both 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes due to smaller node numbers. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
