Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed as 1, 9, and 0 form a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed as 8, 9, and 0 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed as 3, 9, and 1 form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 4 and 5 as the smallest numbered nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 8), but since 9 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
