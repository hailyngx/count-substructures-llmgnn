Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph given:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Node 4 is already considered for triangles with other nodes, so we skip it.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Node 5 is already considered for triangles with other nodes, so we skip it.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Node 7 is already considered for triangles with other nodes, so we skip it.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

**Total number of triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.**

Therefore, the answer is [4].
