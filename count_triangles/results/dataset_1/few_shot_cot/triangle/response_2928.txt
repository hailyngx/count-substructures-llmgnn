Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph with the given information.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1.
    - No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    - No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    - No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    - No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    - No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    - No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    - No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
