Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and are directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
