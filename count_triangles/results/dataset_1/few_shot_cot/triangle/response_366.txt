Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, we will now count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 only has one neighbor, it cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Since Node 4 only has one neighbor, it cannot form any triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * These nodes will be processed similarly considering the pairs that were not mentioned before.
    * Form triangles where possible.

Having calculated the triangles for each node, your task is to complete the process for the remaining nodes and then sum up the total number of triangles found in the graph.
