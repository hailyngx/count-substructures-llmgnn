Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles as the neighbor is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as all neighbors are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
