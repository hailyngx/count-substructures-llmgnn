Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
