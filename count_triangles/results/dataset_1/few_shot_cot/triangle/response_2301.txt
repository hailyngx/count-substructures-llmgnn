Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2 to Node 8:
    * Skipped any pairs that include Nodes with smaller IDs.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

So, the final answer is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7> and <4, 5, 9>.
