Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.
    
Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.  
The triangles found are:
[<2, 4, 6> <0, 2, 4> <0, 2, 8> <1, 2, 4> <1, 2, 8> <0, 4, 8> <2, 6, 8>]
