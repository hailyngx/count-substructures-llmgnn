Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the method presented in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are larger than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are larger than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are larger than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are larger than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
