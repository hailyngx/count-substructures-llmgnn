Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 2, 0>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <4, 6, 1>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <4, 6, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
   * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
   * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <8, 7, 1>.
   * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <9, 4, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
