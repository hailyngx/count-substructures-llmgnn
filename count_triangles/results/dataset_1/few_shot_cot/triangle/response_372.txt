Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to check for Node 3. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to check for Node 4. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to check for Node 5. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to check for Node 7. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to check for Node 8. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to check for Node 9. No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
