Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no edge connecting them directly in the edge list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (7, 3), but since 3 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

        Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
