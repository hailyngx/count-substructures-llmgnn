Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
        Possible triangle: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
        Possible triangle: <1, 2, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
        Possible triangle: <2, 6, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected.
        Possible triangle: <5, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
        Possible triangle: <6, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7 and Node 8:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7 or 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 9>.
