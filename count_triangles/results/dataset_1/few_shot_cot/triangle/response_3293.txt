Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 5 are connected as (6, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 2: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 6 are connected as (8, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: Skipped as it does not form triangles with any other nodes.

* Node 5: Skipped as it does not form triangles with any other nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7: Skipped as it does not form triangles with any other nodes.

* Node 8: Skipped as it does not form triangles with any other nodes.

* Node 9: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
