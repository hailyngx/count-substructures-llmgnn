Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs possible with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

Since there are no more nodes to process that are larger than 1, we will not be able to form any more triangles in this graph. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph. 

Therefore, the output answer is [1].
