Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach detailed in the previous example, here is how we find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there isnâ€™t at least 1 node greater than 8.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [3].
