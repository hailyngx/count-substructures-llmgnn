Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2,4) -> Not a triangle as Node 2 and Node 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2,6) -> Not a triangle as Node 2 and Node 6 are connected, but Node 6 and Node 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2,7) -> Not a triangle as Node 2 and Node 7 are connected, but Node 7 and Node 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (4,6) -> Not a triangle as Node 4 and Node 6 are connected, but Node 6 and Node 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (4,7) -> Not a triangle as Node 4 and Node 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has only 1 neighbor, there can be no triangles involving this node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6,8) -> Not a triangle as Node 6 and Node 8 are connected, but Node 8 and Node 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5,7) -> Not a triangle as Node 5 and Node 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8,9) -> Not a triangle as Node 8 and Node 9 are connected, but Node 9 and Node 4 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1,8) -> Not a triangle as Node 1 and Node 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3,8) -> Not a triangle as Node 3 and Node 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
