Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> Nodes 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are directly connected. One triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any triangles involving nodes smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 9), but since nodes 6 and 9 are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
