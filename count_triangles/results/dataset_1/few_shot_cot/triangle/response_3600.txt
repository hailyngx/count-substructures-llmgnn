Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
