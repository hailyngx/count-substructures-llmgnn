Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example, let's find the triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as (2, 3) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (2, 5) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as (2, 8) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (2, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Does not form a triangle as (3, 5) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as (3, 8) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (3, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as (5, 8) is not an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (5, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (5, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 as (3, 7) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (4, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, and 6 have already been covered in the previous steps.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as (6, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <7, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as (6, 9) is an edge and they are 1-hop neighbors. Triangle formed: <8, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
