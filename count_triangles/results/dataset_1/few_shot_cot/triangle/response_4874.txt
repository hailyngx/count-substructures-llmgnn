Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Let's proceed with counting the triangles in the given graph by following the step-by-step process for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pair involving Node 5 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
