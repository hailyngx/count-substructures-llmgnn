Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also directly connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as (2, 6) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
