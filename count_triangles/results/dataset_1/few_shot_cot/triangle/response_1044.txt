Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle is formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle is formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle is formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle is formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> No triangle is formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle is formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle is formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle is formed as 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
