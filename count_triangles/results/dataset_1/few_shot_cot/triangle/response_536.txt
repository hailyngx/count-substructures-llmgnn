Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's go through each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * No possible triangles as each of them have no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7, 8, 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2 

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
