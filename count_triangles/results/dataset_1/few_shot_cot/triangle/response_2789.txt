Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the example provided and applying the same process to count the triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 2:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
