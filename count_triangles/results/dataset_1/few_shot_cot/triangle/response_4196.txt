Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed <3, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed <3, 7, 8>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Triangle formed <6, 8, 4>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> Triangle formed <7, 8, 4>.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 4 are not connected.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore the answer is [4].
