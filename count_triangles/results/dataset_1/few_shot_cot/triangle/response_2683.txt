Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, here's how we can count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> Both 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) -> Both 6 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
