Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes larger than 2. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Already counted in Node 3's triangles.
    * No other pairs can be formed with nodes larger than 4. No additional triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No new triangles can be formed as all possible pairs have been accounted for in previous nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skipping linked pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles found for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes larger than 7. No triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
