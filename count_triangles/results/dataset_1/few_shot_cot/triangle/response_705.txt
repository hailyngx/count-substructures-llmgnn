Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the provided example for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as it has no pair of 1-hop neighbors directly connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
