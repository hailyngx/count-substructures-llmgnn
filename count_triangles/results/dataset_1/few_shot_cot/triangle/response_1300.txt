Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
