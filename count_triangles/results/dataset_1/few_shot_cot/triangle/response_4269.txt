Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are also connected as (0, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 8 are also connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes individually as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
