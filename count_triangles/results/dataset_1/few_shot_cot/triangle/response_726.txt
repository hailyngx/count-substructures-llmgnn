Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
        * No possible triangles with Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * No triangles possible with Node 2 as there are no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * No triangles possible with Node 5 as there are no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * No triangles possible with Node 6 as there are no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * No triangles possible with Node 8 as there are no neighbors.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
