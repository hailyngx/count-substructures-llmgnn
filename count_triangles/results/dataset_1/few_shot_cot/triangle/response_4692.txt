Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
  * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 9.
  * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 9.
  * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: [3, 4, 9] <Triangle 1>, [0, 3, 9] <Triangle 2>, [0, 4, 9] <Triangle 3>.

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: [1, 3, 4] <Triangle 4>.

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: [2, 4, 9] <Triangle 5>.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: [3, 4, 9] <Triangle 6>.

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 5:
  * No pairs to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 6:
  * No pairs to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 7:
  * No pairs to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 8:
  * No pairs to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 9:
  * No pairs to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

Summarizing the triangles:
[3, 4, 9], [0, 3, 9], [0, 4, 9], [1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 9], [3, 4, 9]

Therefore, there are 6 unique triangles in the given graph.
