Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 3, 6>

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>

* Node 2:
    * Include all triangles involving Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2 as all its 1-hop neighbors are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 6, 8>

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 7, 8>

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 as it has only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Include all triangles involving Node 6.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6 as all its 1-hop neighbors are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 8), but since they are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Include all triangles involving Node 8.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 as all its 1-hop neighbors are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9 as its 1-hop neighbors are not connected to each other.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
[<0, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>]
