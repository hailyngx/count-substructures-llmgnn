Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip possible pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip possible pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there are fewer than 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
