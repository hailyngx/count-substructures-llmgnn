Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as (1, 5) in the edge list.
    * No more eligible pairs left for Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * No more eligible pairs left for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more eligible pairs left for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No eligible pairs for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more eligible pairs left for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * No more eligible pairs left for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No eligible pairs for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No eligible pairs for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No eligible pairs for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No eligible pairs for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
