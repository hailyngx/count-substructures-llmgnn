Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:
        
        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 connect forming a triangle with node 0.
            * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they do not connect directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 connect forming a triangle with node 0.
            * Pair 11: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 12: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they do not connect directly. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 13: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 14: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 15: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 connect forming a triangle with node 1.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 connect forming a triangle with node 1.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
            * No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 connect forming a triangle with node 3.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they do not connect directly. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
            * No triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
            * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with these remaining nodes as the smallest numbered node.

        Summing up the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

        Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
