Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    - Pair 5: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 9 are not connected.
    - Pair 6: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 9 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: <2, 6, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 1) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 1 are not connected.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    - No other pairs to form triangles with. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with only one node or no nodes left.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
