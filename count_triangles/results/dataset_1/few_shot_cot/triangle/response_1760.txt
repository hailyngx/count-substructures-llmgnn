Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * All have only one triangle each due to having exactly 2 shared neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 11

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
