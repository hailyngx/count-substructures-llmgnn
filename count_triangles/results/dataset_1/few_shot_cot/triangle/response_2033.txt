Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0: No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 or 1.
  - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <2, 5, 7>)

- Node 3:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are connected.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <4, 7, 9>)

- Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6: No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
  - No pairs can form triangles with Node 7.

- Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
