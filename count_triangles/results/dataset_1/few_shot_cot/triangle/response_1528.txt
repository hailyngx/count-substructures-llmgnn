Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs are possible with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipped as Node 2 has no edges.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs are possible with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as they have no possible triangles.

Adding up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
