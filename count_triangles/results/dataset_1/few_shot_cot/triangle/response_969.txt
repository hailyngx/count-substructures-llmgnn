Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, or 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 3, or 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
