Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected because (2, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continuing on with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Not enough nodes greater than 8 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
