Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no other nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no other nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to the lack of at least 2 nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
