Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the process described in the previous example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4. The rest of the pairs are not triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * All pairs are with nodes smaller than 7 or not forming triangles.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:  
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
