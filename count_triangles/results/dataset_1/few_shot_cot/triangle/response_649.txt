Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as described in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
