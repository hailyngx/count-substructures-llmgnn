Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    
    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, which is smaller than 6.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. 

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
