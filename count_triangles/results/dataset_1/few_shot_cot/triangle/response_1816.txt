Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step method described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are connected, but they don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors and connected. They form a potential triangle with a shared neighbor.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are connected but don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected, and they have a common neighbor 9. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are connected, but they don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected, but they don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, but they don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors. They form a potential triangle with a shared neighbor.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected and are 1-hop neighbors. They form a potential triangle with a shared neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected, but they don't have common neighbors other than each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least two nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
[<2, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>]
