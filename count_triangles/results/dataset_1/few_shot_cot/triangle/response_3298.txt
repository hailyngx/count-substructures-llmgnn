Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 as they are larger than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 7, 8 as they are larger than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 6, 7 as they are larger than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6 as they are larger than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is larger than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is larger than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is larger than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
