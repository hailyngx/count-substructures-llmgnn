Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
