Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No connected pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No connected pairs for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No connected pairs for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No connected pairs for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No connected pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 1, 2>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 5>, <5, 7, 8>]

Thus, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
