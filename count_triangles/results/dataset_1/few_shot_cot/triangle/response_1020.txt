Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any other nodes as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any other nodes as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any other nodes as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs left to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
