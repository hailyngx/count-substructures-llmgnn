Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>
    * Triangle found: <4, 9, 5>
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
