Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  - No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
