Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained before, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (9, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (1, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles from Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) - Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (9, 1). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles from Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles from Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
[<1, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 6>]
