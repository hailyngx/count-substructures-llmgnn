Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected because (1, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected because (4, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to form triangles, as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 to form triangles as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs from the nodes smaller than 5 to form triangles. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 6.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [5].
