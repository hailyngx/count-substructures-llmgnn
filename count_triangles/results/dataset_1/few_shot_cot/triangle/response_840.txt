1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph with the detailed explanation for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as (2, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [\<0, 2, 4\>, \<0, 2, 8\>]

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [\<2, 4, 8\>]

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 3 as both are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2. They are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs with other nodes can form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No pairs with other nodes can form a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No pairs can form a triangle with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (6, 7) from the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [\<6, 7, 9\>]

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
