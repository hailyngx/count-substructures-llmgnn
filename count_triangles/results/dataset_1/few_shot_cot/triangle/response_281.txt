Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no other nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Nodes 8 or 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
