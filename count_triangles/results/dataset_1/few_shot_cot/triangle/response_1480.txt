Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
