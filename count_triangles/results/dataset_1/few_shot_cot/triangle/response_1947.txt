Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2 as (1, 3) and (3, 2) are there in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Does not form a triangle as (1, 6) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (1, 9) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> Does not form a triangle as (3, 6) is not in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (3, 9) and (9, 1) are there in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (6, 9) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (2, 3) and (3, 0) are there in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as (2, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (3, 5) and (5, 0) are there in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Does not form a triangle as (3, 8) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (6, 9) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (9, 0) and (0, 1) are there in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 3) -> Does not form a triangle as (9, 3) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <1, 0, 3>, <2, 3, 0>, <3, 5, 0>, <9, 0, 1>.
