Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach detailed in the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 6 are also connected as (0, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 0 are also connected as (6, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in (0, 9).
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in (7, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
