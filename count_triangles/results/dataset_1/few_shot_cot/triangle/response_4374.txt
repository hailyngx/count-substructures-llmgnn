Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No more pairs to consider as there are no other unconsidered nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider as there are no other unconsidered nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 is not 1-hop neighbor of 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No more pairs to consider as there are no other unconsidered nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
