Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair involving Node 1 as it is greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, and 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Since Node 8 has no 1-hop neighbors, there can be no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
