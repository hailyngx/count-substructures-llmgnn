Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 3: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 4: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 9: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 4>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 2, 4>. Hence, the final answer is [8].
