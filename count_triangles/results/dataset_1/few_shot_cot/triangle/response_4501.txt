Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
