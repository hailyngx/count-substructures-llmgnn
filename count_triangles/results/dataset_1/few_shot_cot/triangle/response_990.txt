Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped because there is no pair of 1-hop neighbors greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skipped any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
