Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <0, 4, 5>
            * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3: <0, 4, 3>
            * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 5, 8>
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Pair 4: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8: <2, 7, 6>
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <4, 7, 5>
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle can be formed as they are not directly connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <7, 8, 5>
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 9: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        [3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 6

        The unique triangles found are:
        [<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 5>, <7, 8, 5>]

        Therefore, there are total of 6 triangles in the given graph.
        
        The answer is [6].
