Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7:
    * Similar to above, the count of triangles that includes these nodes as the smallest numbered node would be 0.
  
* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 9, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 8, as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
