Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
