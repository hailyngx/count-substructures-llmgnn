Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3 [Triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>]

* Node 1:
   * Skip the pairs already counted with Node 0.
   * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3.
   * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 [Triangle: <1, 3, 4>]

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs already counted with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs already counted with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pairs already counted with Node 0.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
