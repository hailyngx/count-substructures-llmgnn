Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected as (0, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 0 are also connected as (7, 0) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 4 are also connected as (7, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 6 are also connected as (7, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as all its neighbors are also connected with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
