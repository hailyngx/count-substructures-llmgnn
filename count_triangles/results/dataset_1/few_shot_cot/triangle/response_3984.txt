Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as there are no triangles involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
