Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 6: <2, 3, 6>

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
