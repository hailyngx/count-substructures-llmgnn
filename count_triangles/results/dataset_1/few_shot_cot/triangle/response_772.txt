Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
