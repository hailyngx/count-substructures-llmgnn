Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 7 are directly connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 2 are also connected as (1, 2) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
