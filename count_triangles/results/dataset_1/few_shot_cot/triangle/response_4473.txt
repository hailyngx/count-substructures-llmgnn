Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (7, 9, 5)

* Node 6:
   * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
   * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0 

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
