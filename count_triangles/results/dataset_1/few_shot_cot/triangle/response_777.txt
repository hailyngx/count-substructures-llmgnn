Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No new triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles found with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No new triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles found with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No new triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [5]
