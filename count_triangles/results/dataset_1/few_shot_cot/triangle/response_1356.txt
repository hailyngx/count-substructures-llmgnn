Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
