Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes as no nodes are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes as no nodes are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
