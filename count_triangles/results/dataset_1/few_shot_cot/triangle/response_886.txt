Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process illustrated in the example provided earlier:

* Node 0:
     * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
     * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
     * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
     * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
     * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
     * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
     * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
     * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
     * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
     * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
     * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
     * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
     * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found in the graph are: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 8>. 

So, the final answer is [6].
