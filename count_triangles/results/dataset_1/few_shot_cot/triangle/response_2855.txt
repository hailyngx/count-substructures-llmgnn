Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No edge between 1 and 2. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No edge between 1 and 3. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - The only pair we could consider is (4, 6), but since 4 and 6 are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
