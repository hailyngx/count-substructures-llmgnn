Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Let's begin the process of counting triangles in the given graph:

- For Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    - Pair 5: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not connected.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- For Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

- For Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

- For Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

- For Node 4:
    - Node 4 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

- For Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

- For Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are directly connected (3, 7) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- For Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

- For Node 8:
    - Node 8 does not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

- For Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
