Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * There are no edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
