Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No possible triangles as it has only 1 neighbor.

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - No possible triangles as node 2 has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles as node 3 has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 4:
    - No possible triangles as node 4 has only 1 neighbor.

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 6:
    - No possible triangles as node 6 has only 3 neighbors.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangles as node 8 has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 9:
    - No possible triangles as node 9 has only 3 neighbors.

Adding up the triangles from each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
