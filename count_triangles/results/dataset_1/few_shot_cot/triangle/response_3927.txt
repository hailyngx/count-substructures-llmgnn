Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
