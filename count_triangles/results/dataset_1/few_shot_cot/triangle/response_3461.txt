Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, we will now determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
