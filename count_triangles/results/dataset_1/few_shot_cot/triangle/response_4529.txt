Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}
