Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected, but 5 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, but 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected, but 6 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected, but 8 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8:
    * No triangles can be formed as they either do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them or the necessary 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected, but 5 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected, and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 9 does not have at least 2 nodes greater than it or the necessary 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [2].
