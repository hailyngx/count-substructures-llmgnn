Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other possible triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    No triangles possible.

* Node 6:
    No triangles possible.

* Node 7:
    No triangles possible.

* Node 8:
    No triangles possible.

* Node 9:
    No triangles possible.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
