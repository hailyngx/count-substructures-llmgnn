Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same method used in the example earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Forms a triangle with node 6: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Forms a triangle with node 5: <1, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 4: <1, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Forms a triangle with node 5: <2, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Forms a triangle with node 2: <3, 4, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
