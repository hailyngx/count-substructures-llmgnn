Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, we will determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 7.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 9.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) - Triangle formed as 4, 5, and 0 build a triangle. <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 4 and 7.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 4 and 9.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) - Triangle formed as 5, 7, and 0 build a triangle. <0, 5, 7>
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Triangle formed as 5, 7, and 1 build a triangle. <1, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 8.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 7.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 8.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 7 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed as 5, 6, and 4 build a triangle. <4, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - Triangle formed as 5, 7, and 4 build a triangle. <4, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
