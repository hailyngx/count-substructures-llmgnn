Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
