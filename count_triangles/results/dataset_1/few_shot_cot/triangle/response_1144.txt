Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 since it's smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> Edge (9, 2) exists in the list, forming a triangle with Node 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Both have less than 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
