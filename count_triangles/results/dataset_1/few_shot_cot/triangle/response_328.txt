Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles, they will not contribute to any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
