Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as it has only one neighbor Node 1.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 1 as a vertex.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it has only one neighbor Node 5.

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 3 as a vertex.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has only neighbors 5, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - No other pairs can form a triangle with Node 5 as a vertex.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has only two neighbors 3 and 5.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it has neighbors 1, 4, 8, and 9 only.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it has only two neighbors 4 and 7.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it has neighbors 1, 3, 4, and 7.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<3, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 9>].
