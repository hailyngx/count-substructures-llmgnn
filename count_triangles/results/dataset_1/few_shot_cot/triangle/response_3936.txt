Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * <0, 2, 5> - Formed by the edges (0, 2), (0, 5), and (2, 5).
    * <0, 6, 8> - Formed by the edges (0, 6), (0, 8), and (6, 8).
    * <0, 6, 9> - Formed by the edges (0, 6), (0, 9), and (6, 9).
    * <0, 8, 9> - Formed by the edges (0, 8), (0, 9), and (8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * <2, 3, 7> - Formed by the edges (2, 3), (2, 7), and (3, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * <5, 6, 8> - Formed by the edges (5, 6), (5, 8), and (6, 8).
    * <5, 6, 9> - Formed by the edges (5, 6), (5, 9), and (6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * <9, 0, 1> - Formed by the edges (9, 0), (9, 1), and (0, 1).
    * <9, 0, 3> - Formed by the edges (9, 0), (9, 3), and (0, 3).
    * <9, 0, 5> - Formed by the edges (9, 0), (9, 5), and (0, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
