Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process like in the previous example, we can find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list, but 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list, but 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> 6 and 2 are connected as (6, 2) in the edge list, but 4 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed because there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [0].
