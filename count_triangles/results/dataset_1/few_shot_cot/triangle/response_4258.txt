Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Triangle: <1, 2, 3>
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Triangle: <5, 7, 4>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, which are <1, 2, 3> and <5, 7, 4>.
