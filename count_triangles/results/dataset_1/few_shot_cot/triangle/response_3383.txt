Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Similar to Pair 2, 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Similar to Pair 3, 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected directly, 6 is 1-hop neighbor of 1 but 9 isn't. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No available pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6 to 9:
    * There are no pairs to form triangles with any of these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
