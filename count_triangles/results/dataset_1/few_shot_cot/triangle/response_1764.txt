Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions similar to the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
