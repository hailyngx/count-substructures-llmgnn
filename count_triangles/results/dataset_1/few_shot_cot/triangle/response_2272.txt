Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed <0, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as (3, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed <1, 3, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed <1, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed <2, 3, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as (3, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed <2, 3, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No additional triangles can be formed starting from Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5: 0

* Node 6:
    * No connections to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No new triangles for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed <4, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 8: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed <5, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
