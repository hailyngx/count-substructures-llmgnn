Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the process detailed in the example provided with one difference in the current graph: you only stop calculations after the third node as there are no nodes of a higher value to complete the triangles with. Let's go through each node step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Not a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes with a higher value to form triangles with.

Since there are no nodes after Node 3 to make triangles, we can stop the calculations here.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
