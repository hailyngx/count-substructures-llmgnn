Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * No pairs possible with larger numbered nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
            * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are:
        [<0, 1, 6>, <3, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>]. 

        So, the number of triangles in the graph is [4].
