Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 7: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 8: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 8

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 8 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
