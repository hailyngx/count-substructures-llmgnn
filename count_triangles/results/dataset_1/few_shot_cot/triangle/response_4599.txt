Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (1, 9) does not exist in the edge list. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 2) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as there are no valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
