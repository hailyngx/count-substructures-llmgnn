Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles by summing the triangles found with each node as the smallest numbered node:

* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
