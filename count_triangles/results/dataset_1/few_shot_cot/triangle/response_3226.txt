Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as before to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
* [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
