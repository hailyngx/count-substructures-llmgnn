Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected and are 1-hop neighbors of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected, even though they are 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected and are also 1-hop neighbors of 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 8), but since 7 and 8 are smaller nodes, we skip this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
