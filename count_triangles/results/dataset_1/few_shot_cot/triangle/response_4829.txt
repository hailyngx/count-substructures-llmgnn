Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
            No neighbors to form triangles.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            No neighbors to form triangles.

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            No neighbors to form triangles.

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            No neighbors to form triangles.

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
