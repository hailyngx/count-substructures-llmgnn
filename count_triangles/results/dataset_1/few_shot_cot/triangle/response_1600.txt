Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the example step-by-step approach, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7:
    * Not enough nodes left to form triangles. No calculation needed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
