Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 3) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9) is in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 5) is in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as (4, 7) is in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) is in the edge list, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4.
