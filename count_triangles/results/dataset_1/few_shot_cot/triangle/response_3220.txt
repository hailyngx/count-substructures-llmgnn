Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the same method described in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 2 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip as there are no pairs to form triangles with Node 4 being the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped because there is only one neighbor and there are no other nodes to form a triangle with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip as pairs with smaller nodes have already been considered.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
