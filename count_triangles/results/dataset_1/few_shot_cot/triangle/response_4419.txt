Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 5). However, 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5). However, 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 9). However, 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 and 5 are not distinct nodes. Skip.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 are not distinct nodes. Skip.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Node 6 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * The only pair we could consider is (9, 9), but since 9 and 9 are not distinct nodes, this pair is skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 8 and 9:
        * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
