Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the same method outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - 2 and 3 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - 2 and 9 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 3 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (0, 2, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (1, 2, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
