Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as outlined in the initial example, I will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles are <0, 4, 5> and <4, 5, 8>.
