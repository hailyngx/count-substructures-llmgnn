Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 7 are also connected as (0, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
