Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
