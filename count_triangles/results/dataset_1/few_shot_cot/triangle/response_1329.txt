Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 5:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

Output: [7]
