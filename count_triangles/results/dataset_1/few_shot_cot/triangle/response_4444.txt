Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 is connected to 2, forming the edge (1, 2), and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 is connected to 6, forming the edge (1, 6), and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 is connected to 6, forming the edge (2, 6), and they are also 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 is directly connected to 9, forming the edge (4, 9), and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since both are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
