Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 8}

Response:
Following the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    - Skip any pairs with Node 2 and Node 3 as they are bigger than 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 and 4 as they are bigger.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller.
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are bigger.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No neighbors, so no triangles possible.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller.
    - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> Forms a triangle with 2.
    - Pair 2: (0, 2) -> Forms a triangle with 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with 8.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Forms a triangle with 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
