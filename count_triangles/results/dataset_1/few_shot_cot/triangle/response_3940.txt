Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 5>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 7>.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 3, 7>.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed <1, 4, 5>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 2:
    - Skip all pairs as all nodes connected to Node 2 are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip all pairs as all nodes connected to Node 3 are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs as all nodes connected to Node 4 are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs as all nodes connected to Node 5 are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No possible pairs to form a triangle with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - No possible pairs to form triangles involving nodes 8 and 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
