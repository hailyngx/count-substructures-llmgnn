Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it has a smaller number.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [3].
