Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed because 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed because 7 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> No triangle formed because 9 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 due to the connectivity with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
