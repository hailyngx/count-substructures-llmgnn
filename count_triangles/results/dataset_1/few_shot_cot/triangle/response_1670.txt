Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the previous example:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 6: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 7: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 8: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No potential triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * Since Node 9 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
