Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 8), but since 0 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> No triangles can be formed because there is only one connection to each node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 5), but since 2 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
