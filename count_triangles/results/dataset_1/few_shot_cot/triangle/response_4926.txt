Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> Node 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> Node 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
    * Pair 7: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Node 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Node 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Node 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and they are connected. Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) = 7.
