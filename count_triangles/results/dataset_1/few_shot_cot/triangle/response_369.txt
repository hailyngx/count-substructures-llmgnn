Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
