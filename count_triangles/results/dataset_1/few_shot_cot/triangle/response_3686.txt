Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 since 1 is greater than 0. No triangles formed.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 since 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 8 since they are greater than 2. No triangles formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 9 since they are greater than 3. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 9 since they are greater than 4. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as there's no node greater than 5. No triangles formed.

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 9 since they are greater than 7. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 since 9 is greater than 8. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.
