Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 3 and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
