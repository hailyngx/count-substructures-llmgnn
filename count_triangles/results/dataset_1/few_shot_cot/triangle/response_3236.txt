Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 5 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be formed with just one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can be formed with just one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
