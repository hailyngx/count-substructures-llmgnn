Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (0, 6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (0, 6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * No new triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * No new triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
