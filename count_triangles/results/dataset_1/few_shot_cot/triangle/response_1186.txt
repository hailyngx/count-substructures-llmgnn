Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected. 
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. 
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Since they do not form triangles with at least two nodes greater than them, they are skipped.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the output should be [5].
