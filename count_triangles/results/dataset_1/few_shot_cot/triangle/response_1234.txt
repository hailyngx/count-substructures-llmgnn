Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 7 are directly connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> Both 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 4 are directly connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = [4].

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The triangles are: 
<4, 9, 7>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 8, 7>, <0, 6, 8>.
