Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example and using the provided graph information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 0 is smaller, all pairs involving Node 0 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, 3:
    * Skipped as they have no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors larger than 4 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Since Node 0 is smaller, all pairs involving Node 0 are skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Since Node 0 is smaller, all pairs involving Node 0 are skipped.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
