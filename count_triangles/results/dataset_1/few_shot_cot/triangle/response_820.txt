Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided earlier:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<3, 1, 6>, <5, 6, 8>]
