Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped due to fewer than 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
