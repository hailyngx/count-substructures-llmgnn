Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 0.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 1.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 3.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 4.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    Unique triangles: <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    Unique triangles: <3, 5, 8>

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4
* Unique triangles: <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. The final answer is [4].
