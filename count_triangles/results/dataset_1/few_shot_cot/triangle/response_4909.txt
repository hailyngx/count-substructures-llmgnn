1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> The nodes 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> The nodes 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> The nodes 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> The nodes 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> The nodes 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> The nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> The nodes 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> The nodes 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> The nodes 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 and are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles. No triangle formed.

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles. No triangle formed.

8. Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> The nodes 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 7 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> The nodes 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
