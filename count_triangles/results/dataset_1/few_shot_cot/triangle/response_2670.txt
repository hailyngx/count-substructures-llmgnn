Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (1, 0, 3). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (1, 0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (3, 0, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No edges connected to Node 9, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 7>]
