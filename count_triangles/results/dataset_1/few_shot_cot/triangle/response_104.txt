Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the procedure shown in the first example, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 1) as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 5>
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 7>
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 8>
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <2, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pair (1, 3) as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Triangle formed: <6, 7, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 10

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
