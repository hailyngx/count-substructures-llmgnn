Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
