Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach from the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs found to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
