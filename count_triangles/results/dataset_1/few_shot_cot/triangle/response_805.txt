Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
