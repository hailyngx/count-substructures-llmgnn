Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
