Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with other nodes since they are all greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with other nodes since they are all greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 8), but since 2 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 1), but since 0 and 1 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
