Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.

* Node 5:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No suitable pairs to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 4)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
