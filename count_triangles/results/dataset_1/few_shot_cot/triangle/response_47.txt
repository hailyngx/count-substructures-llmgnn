Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 5 and 0 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
