Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as (0, 2) and (0, 6) are in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as (1, 4) and (1, 6) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (5, 6) and (5, 7) are in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected directly in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as (5, 7) and (5, 9) are in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
