Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 4), but since 4 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 4), but since both 1 and 4 are smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
