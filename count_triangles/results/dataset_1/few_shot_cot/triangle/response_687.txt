Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 6.

        * Node 7:
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed involving Node 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

        Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
