Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 3, 7>
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 5 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
