Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Skip all pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * No more triangles possible with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 2:
        * Skip all pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * No more triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * No more triangles possible with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * No neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 6:
        * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No more triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7: (Replaces 8 and 9 as they are smaller than 7)
        * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * No more triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered node.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 5) = 6.

    Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
