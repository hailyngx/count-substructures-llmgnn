Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider. No more triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
