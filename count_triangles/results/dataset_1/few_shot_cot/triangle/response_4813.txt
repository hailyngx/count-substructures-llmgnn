Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Triangle formed with node 2 and node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Triangle formed with node 3 and node 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Triangle formed with node 3 and node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Triangle formed with node 7 and node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
