Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider as Node 7 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are **2** triangles in the given graph. Hence, this can be represented as: [2].
