Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will count the triangles present in the given graph for each node:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Checking the edge list further, we see that 1 is connected to 8 as well. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Checking the edge list further, we see that 1 is connected to 9 as well. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Checking the edge list further, we see that 1 is connected to 7 as well. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Checking the edge list further, we see that 1 is connected to 9 as well. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
