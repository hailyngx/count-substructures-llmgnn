Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Connected as (4, 7) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected as (4, 9) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Connected as (4, 5) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Connected as (4, 9) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Connected as (5, 9) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Connected as (6, 7) and both nodes are 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, no triangles possible.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Similarly, no other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
