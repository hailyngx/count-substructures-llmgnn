Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
