Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 4), but since 1 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
