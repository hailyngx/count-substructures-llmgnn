1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0).
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1).
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
