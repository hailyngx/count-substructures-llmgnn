Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 to Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed as 8 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
