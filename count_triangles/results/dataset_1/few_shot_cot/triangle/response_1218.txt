Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2, as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
