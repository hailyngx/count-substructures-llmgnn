Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
