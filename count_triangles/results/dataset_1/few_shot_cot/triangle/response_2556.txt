Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided with the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Node 4 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - Node 2 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) - Node 2 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) - Node 2 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - Node 5 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Node 5 and Node 6 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are also directly connected in the graph. Triangle formed: <2, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Node 4 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Node 5 and Node 8 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are also directly connected in the graph. Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 9), but since 2 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph: [<2, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 8>].
So, the final answer is [2].
