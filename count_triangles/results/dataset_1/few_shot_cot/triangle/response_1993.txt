Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <0, 4, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <0, 5, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Both 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (0, 2) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <0, 2, 3>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <4, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed - <5, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph. 
[<0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>,  <0, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 3>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 9>]
