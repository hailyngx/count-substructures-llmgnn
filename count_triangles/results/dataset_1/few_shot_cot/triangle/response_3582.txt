Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 1) -> 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, but (1, 1) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs considering Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs considering all other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
