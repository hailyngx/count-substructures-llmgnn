Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find all the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 7) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for both nodes. No triangles possible.

* Node 5, 6:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they have smaller numbered nodes to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
