Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process like in the example provided: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and 2.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and 3.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 1 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair (0, 2) as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 2 and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with node 3 and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

Continuing until Node 9 gives a total of 5 triangles.
