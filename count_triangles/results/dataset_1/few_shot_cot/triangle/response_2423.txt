Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles since Node 1 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles since Node 2 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles since Node 3 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles since Node 6 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Nodes 3 or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
So the answer is [2].
