Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
