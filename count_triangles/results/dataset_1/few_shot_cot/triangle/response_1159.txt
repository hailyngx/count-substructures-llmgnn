Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the previous example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
* Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
