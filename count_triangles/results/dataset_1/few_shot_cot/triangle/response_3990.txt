Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No connections exist for Node 8 to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8 

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <6, 7, 9>.
