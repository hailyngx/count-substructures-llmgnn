Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
