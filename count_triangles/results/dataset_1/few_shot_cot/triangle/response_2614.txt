Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 1) -> 5 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the answer is [1].
