Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1 as they are smaller than 1.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
