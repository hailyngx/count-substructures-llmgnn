Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the example given, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 7), but since 5 and 7 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed involving Node 8 as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
