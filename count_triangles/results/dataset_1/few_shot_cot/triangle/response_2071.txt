Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are directly connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are directly connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 8 are directly connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 3 are directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No new triangles can be formed using the remaining nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed using only these nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
