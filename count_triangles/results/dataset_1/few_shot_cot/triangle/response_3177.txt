Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as before to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (0, 9). No other triangles are formed with node 1.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles with node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
