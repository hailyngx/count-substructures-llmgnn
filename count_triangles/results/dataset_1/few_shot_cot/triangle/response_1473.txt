Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8:
    * Skipped as there are not enough nodes greater than these to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs left to consider. No triangle formed.

* Nodes 5 and 6:
    * Skip as there are not enough nodes greater than these to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No valid pairs left to consider. No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
