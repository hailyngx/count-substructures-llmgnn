Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip, only has one neighbor (0).

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip, as it has no neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as only has one neighbor (8).

* Nodes 6, 7, 9:
    * Skipped as they have no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Nodes 6, 7, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
