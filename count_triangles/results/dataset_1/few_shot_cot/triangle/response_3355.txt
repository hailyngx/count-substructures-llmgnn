Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the instructions provided in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    
* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1-hop neighbors).
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
