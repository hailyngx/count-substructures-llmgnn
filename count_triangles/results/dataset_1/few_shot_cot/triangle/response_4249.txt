Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example given earlier, let's count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Nodes 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 3) -> Nodes 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are connected.
    * Pair 9: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Nodes 9 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no connected nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
