Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Following the process described in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
