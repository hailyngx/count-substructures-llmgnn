Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Other pairs involving Node 1 do not form triangles due to lack of direct edges.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Following the same reasoning above, after checking all pairs, no triangles are formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
