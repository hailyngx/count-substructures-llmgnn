Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 2), but since 2 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
