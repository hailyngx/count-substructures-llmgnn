Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed as (1, 4) edge is missing.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed as (1, 5) edge is missing.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed as (1, 9) edge is missing.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as (4, 5) edge is missing.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) - No triangle formed as (4, 9) edge is missing.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) - Triangle formed with nodes 0, 5, 9. Triangle: <0, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as (6, 9) edge is missing.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as (7, 9) edge is missing.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed as (8, 9) edge is missing.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) - Triangle formed with nodes 5, 6, 9. Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as (7, 9) edge is missing.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The other node (9) is smaller, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
