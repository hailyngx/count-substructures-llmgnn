Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}
