Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, we can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, forming a triangle together. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
