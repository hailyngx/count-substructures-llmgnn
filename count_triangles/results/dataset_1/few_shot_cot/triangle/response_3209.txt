Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs since all other nodes are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) - Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) - Both 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1. 

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
