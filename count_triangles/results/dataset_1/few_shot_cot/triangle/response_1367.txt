Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6}
