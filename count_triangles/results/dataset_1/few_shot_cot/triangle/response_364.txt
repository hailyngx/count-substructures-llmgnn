Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the method explained in the example, here is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 4 are also connected as (7, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 5 are also connected as (8, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 6 are also connected as (8, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 6 are also connected as (9, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
