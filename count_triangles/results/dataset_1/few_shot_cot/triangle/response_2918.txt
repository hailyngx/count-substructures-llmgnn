Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7: <1, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Node 3, and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <2, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 & 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [5].
