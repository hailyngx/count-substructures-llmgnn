Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Let's go through each node step-by-step to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipped as there are not enough nodes greater than 5 to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Summarizing the pairs for Node 7: (0, 4), (0, 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
