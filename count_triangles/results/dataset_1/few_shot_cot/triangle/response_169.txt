Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible pairs for forming triangles, as there are no 2 other nodes that are greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 7) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Moving forward:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
