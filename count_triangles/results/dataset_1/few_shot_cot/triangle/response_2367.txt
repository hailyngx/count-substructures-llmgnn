Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
  - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
  - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
  - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
  - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
  - Pair 2: (5, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 3:
  - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
  - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
  - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
  - Cannot form triangles as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
