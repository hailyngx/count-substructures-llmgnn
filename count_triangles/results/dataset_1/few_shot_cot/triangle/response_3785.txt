Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the example shown, we will calculate the number of triangles in the graph step by step for each node:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected, forming a triangle.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected, so no triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * No pairs for Node 2 as 2 has the smallest index among all pairs.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected, forming a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs for Node 4 as 4 has the smallest index among all pairs.

    * Node 5:
        * No pairs for Node 5 as 5 has the smallest index among all pairs.

    * Node 6:
        * No pairs with nodes smaller than 6.

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs for Node 7 as 7 has the smallest index among all pairs.

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skip as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.
    
    Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
