Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed (0, 1, 5).
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed (0, 1, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed (1, 5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed (3, 5, 8).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed (5, 6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed (7, 8, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

So, the answer is [6].
