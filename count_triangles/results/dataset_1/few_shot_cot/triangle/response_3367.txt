Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
