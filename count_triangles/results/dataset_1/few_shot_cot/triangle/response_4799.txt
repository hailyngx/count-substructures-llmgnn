Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's proceed with finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3. 
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles involving Node 4 can be formed.

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there isn't a combination of 3 nodes with numbers greater than these nodes. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
