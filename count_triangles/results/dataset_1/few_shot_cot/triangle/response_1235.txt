Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4 and Node 5:
    * Skipped as they have no 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 6) +0 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
