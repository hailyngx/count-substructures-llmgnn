Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected (1, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are also connected (5, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected (5, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected (9, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only possible pair involving Node 6 is (5, 2), but since 2 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
