Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process indicated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Continue this process for Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 following the detailed steps for each node until all nodes have been accounted for.

Final Answer: [5]
