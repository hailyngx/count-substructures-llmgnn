Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is greater than 0.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is greater than 2.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are greater than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 8 as they are greater than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is greater than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is greater than 6.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are greater than 7, this pair is skipped.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t any edge configurations to form triangles.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
