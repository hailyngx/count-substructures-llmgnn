Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No edges connected to Node 3, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
