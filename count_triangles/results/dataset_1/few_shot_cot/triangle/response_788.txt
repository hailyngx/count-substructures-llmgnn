1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Nodes 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Nodes 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> Nodes 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Nodes 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Nodes 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Nodes 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> Nodes 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Nodes 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Nodes 8 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
