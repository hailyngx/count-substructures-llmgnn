Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for finding triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as (4, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) - Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
