Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 14: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there isn't a direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped for being smaller than other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

[I will now list them down]
[<4, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>]
