Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as they are smaller than 1 and there are no other pairs to consider. No triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider. No other triangles formed.

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
