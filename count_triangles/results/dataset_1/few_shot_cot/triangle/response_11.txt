Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6)

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected, and they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected, and they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected, and they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not connected and not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected, and they are both 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
