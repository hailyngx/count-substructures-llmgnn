Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs because all 1-hop neighbors of 3 are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs because all 1-hop neighbors of 4 are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skipped because it has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs because all 1-hop neighbors of 9 are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
