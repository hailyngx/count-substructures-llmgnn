Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    
    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * No pairs for Node 3. No triangles formed.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 5) -> 6 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.

    * Node 7:
        * No pairs for Node 7. No triangles formed.

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * No pairs for Node 9. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9 triangles] in the given graph.
