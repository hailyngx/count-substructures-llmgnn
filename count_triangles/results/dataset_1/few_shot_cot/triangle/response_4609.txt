Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the graph based on each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 2 and 3.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 3 and 5.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 5 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 8 and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 5 and 0.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 5 and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle can be formed as there is no edge between 7 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
