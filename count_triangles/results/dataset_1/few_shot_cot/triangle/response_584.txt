Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the method used in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 5) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No connections, so no triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 6 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 8), but since 9 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
