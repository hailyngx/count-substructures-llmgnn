Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Triangle formed as 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Triangle formed as 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Triangle formed as 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) - Triangle formed as 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs as there isn't at least one node greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs as there isn't at least one node greater than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs as there isn't at least one node greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Triangle formed as 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Triangle formed as 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - Triangle formed as 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
