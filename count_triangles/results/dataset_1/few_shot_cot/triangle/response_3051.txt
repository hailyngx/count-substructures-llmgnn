Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Nodes 7, 8, 9) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
