Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are connected as (2, 5).
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are connected as (0, 6).
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as (0, 7).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (2, 3) and (2, 4).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (6, 8) and (6, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
