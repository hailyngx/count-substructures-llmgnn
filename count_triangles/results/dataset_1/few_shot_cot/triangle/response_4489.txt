Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected. Checking 4's neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 6, 8). 4 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are connected. Checking 5's neighbors: (0, 1, 6). 1 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected. Checking 8's neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 9). 1 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. Checking 4's neighbors: (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8). 3 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected. Checking 8's neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 9). 4 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are connected. Checking 6's neighbors: (4, 5, 8, 9). 4 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected. Checking 9's neighbors: (3, 6, 8). 3 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed: <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 7 has no neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 9's neighbors (3, 6, 8) do not form triangles with 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles: 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <4, 6, 8>, <1, 5, 6>, and <6, 8, 9>.
