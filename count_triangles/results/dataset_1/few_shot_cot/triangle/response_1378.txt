Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
