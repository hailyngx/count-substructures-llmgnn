Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are also connected as (2, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
