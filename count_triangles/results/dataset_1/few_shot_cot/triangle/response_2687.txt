Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example:

* Node 0: No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are connected as (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No connected 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * No connected 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3 smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No connected 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No connected 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No connected 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
