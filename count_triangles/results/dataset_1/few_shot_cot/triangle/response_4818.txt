Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 9 and 7 are also connected as (9, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> Both 9 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 3 are also connected as (9, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> Both 9 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 1 are also connected as (9, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Since Node 8 has no 1-hop neighbors, no triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
