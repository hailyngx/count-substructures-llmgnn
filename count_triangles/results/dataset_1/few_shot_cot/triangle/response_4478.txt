Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 2:
    * Skip edges with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 4:
    * No new triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 6:
    * Skip edges with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No new triangles with Node 8 as the smallest node due to the lack of additional nodes.

* Node 9:
    * Skip edges with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
