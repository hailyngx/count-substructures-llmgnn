Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as there are no nodes greater than 0 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 1 as there are no nodes greater than 1 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 3 as there are no nodes greater than 3 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * There are no edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 5 as there are no nodes greater than 5 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 7 as there are no nodes greater than 7 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as (9, 2) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 9 as there are no nodes greater than 9 connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
