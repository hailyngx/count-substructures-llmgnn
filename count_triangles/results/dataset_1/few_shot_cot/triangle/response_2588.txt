Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as provided in the example using the adjacency list and edge list:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
