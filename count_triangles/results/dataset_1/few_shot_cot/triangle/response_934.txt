Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) - No triangle formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) - No triangle formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (9, 5) - No triangle formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2)
* Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 5>

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
