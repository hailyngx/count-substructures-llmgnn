Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the instruction in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected as there is no edge (3, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs can be formed using Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed using Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
