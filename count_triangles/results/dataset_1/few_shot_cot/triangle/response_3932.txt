Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5)

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * The only possible pair is (0, 1) with 0 and 1 not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * The only possible pair is (4, 7) with 4 and 7 not forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) is not a valid pair as 9 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No triangle can be formed as each of these nodes has only one or fewer nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
