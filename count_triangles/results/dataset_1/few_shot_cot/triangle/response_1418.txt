Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the process described in the previous example, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 to 9 as they are larger than 1. No triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 6 has no connections with other nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 to 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * They do not form triangles with any other nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
