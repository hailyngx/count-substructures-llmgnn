Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangle can be formed by node 1 as part of the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed by node 2 as part of the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and also connected (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9, respectively.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 4) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
