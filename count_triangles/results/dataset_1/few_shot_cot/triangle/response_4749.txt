Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 8), but since 3 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4, 5, and 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9: 
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 7) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 8, 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
