Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Triangle formed with Node 8 is not possible as there is no edge between 5 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Triangle formation with Node 2 is skipped as 2 is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are [9] triangles in the given graph.
