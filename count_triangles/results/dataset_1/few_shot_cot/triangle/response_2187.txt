Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph provided:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 3: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 0 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 9. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 9: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
