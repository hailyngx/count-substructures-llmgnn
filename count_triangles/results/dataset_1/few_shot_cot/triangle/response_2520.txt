Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph: 0

[0].
