Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Now we need to check if 1 and 6 are directly connected. They are directly connected as (1, 6) is in the edge list. Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) - 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) - 1 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) - Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: <7, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) = 2.
Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is [2].
