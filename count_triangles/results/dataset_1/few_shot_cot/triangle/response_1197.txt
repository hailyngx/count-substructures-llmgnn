Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) - 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that involves Node 0 as its smaller neighbor.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) - 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) - 7 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
