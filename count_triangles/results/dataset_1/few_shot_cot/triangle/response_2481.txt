Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph described:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip as there are no pairs with higher-numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> 8 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (8, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4, and hence no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
