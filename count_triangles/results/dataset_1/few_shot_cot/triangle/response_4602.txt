Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same approach as the previous example, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected as (2, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 due to lower node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) is in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with all other nodes due to lower node numbers.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
