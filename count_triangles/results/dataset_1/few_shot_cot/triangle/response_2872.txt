Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 1.
  * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> 6 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * No pairs meet the requirements for triangle formation.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
  * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * Pair 1: (7, 0) -> 7 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
  * Skip these nodes as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
