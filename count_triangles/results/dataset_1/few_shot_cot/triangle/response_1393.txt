Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle found: <0, 1, 2>
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle found: <1, 2, 4>
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - Skipped due to no 1-hop neighbor for each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 4>]
