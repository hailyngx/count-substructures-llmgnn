Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example above, we will now count the triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> 8 is directly connected to itself, forming a triangle {4, 8, 8}.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles form with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, forming a triangle {6, 2, 9}.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles form with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles form with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles form with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
