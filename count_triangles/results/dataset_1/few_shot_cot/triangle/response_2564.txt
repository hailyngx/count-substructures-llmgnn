Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 4, 6>.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed <1, 3, 4>.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
  - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
  - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
  - Node 9 does not have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph, which are <0, 4, 6> and <1, 3, 4>.
