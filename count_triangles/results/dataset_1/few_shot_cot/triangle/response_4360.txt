Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
