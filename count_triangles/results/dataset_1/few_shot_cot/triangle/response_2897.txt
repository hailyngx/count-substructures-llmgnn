Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 1 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 3 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more pairs to consider. Node 1 cannot form any triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed by considering pairs with Node 0 and Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4 and 5:
    * Skipped as they have no edges and cannot form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs to consider. 
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because no remaining nodes are greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 triangles in the given graph.
