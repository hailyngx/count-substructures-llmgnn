Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the approach from the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No valid pairs to form triangles as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller than 8 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
