Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example given above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 0.
        * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 1.
        * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
        * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * No more triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
        * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8 and Node 9:
        * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5 

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
