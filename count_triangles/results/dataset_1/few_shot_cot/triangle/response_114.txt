Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 4. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with nodes greater than 7. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
