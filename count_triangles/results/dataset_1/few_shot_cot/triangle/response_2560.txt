Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, as 0 is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
Therefore, the answer is [1].

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
