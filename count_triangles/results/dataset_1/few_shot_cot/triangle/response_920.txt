Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed because 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed because 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - Triangle formed: <1, 2, 8>
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed because 4 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed because 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed because 5 and 9 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
 * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
