Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as before to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Skip the only pair available (6, 9) as 6 is smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
