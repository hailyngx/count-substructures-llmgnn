Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are not directly connected, no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no pairs greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as there are no pairs with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 8 or Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [3].
