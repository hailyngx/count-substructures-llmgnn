Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Let's go through each node in the graph to count the number of triangles:

    * Node 0:
        No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 0.

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
        Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
        * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
        * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
        * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected in the edge list, so no triangle is formed.
        * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 4 as all other nodes are smaller and not directly connected.

    * Node 5:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 5 as all other nodes are either not directly connected or smaller.

    * Node 6:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 6 as all other nodes are smaller.

    * Node 7:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 7 as all other nodes are smaller.

    * Node 8:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 8 as all other nodes are smaller.

    * Node 9:
        No pairs can be formed with Node 9 as all other nodes are smaller.

    Summarizing the triangles: 
    * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

    Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
