Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
