Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above:

1. Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

4. Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (9, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

8. Node 7:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
