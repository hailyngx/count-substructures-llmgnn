Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected to node 0 and connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected to node 0 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected to node 0 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are connected to node 0 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected to node 0 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected to node 0 but not connected to each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 5 and connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 5 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of node 5 and connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 5 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected to node 7 and also connected to each other. Triangle formed.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 as it is smaller than 9.
    * No more possible triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
