Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair is (3, 6), but since 3 and 6 are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair is (0, 7), but since 0 and 7 are smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0
