Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

  * Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) - No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 7) - Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

  * Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  Now, continue for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

  * Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

  * Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

  Summarizing the triangles:
  * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

  Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
