Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 <1, 4, 8>

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8) - 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 6. No possible triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles as there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
