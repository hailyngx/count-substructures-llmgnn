Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 7, 8, 9 as they are greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 8, 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
