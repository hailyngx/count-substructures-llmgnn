Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.

- Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as Node 9 is its only 1-hop neighbor.

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
