Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 1:
    * No pairs can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
* Node 3:
    * No pairs can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 8:
    * No pairs can form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 6
* Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
