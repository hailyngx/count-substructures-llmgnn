Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the approach outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0)
* Total triangles in the graph =  [1].

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
