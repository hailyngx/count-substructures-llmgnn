Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 1.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No more pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
