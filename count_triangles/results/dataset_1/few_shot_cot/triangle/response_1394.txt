Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are all smaller than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Since we have found all the triangles involving nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, the count so far is [1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4)] = 3.

Continuing the process for the remaining nodes:

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are all smaller than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are all smaller than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are all smaller than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * The only possible triangle involves nodes 4 and 6, which are both smaller than 8. Hence, no triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * The only possible triangle involves nodes 7 and 8, which are both smaller than 9. Hence, no triangle is formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (from Nodes 0 and 1)
Therefore, the correct answer is [3].
