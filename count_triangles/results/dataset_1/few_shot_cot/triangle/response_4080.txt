Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected and both 1-hop neighbors of 1, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected but do not have 1-hop connection with 4, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected but do not have 1-hop connection with 7, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
