Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0, so there are no triangles involving Node 0.

* Node 1:
    No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    No edges connected to Node 4, so there are no triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 2)
[2]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph: <5, 6, 2>, <5, 7, 2>.
