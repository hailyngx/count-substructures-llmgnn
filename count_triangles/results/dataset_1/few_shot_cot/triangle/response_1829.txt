Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same methodology as the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed with node 6: <0, 2, 3>
    - Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 5: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 6: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 7: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 2: <0, 3, 9>
    - Pair 8: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 6: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 7: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 8: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 9: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 2, 4>
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 4: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed with node 0: <0, 2, 3>
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 7: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 8: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 9: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 10: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 11: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 12: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 13: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 14: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Pair 15: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Remaining nodes will be processed in a follow-up message.

Continuing with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
