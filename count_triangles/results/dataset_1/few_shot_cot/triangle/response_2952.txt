Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, we can determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are directly connected. Checking for the third connection.
        * (0, 8) - Yes, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are directly connected. Checking for the third connection.
        * (2, 5) - Yes, forming a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Checking for the third connection.
        * (5, 8) - Yes, forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 5>, <5, 8, 9>]
