Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Proceeding with the process of counting triangles step-by-step for each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    Triangle: (3, 4, 9) -> Nodes 3, 4, and 9 form a triangle as they are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 and are connected to each other.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    Triangle: (4, 5, 9) -> Nodes 4, 5, and 9 form a triangle as they are all 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 and are connected to each other.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    Skipping pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    No triangles can be formed as there are no two other nodes connected to form a triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total number of triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 unique triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles are <3, 4, 9> and <3, 5, 9>.
