Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 6: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 11: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 12: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 13: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 14: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 15: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 16: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 17: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 18: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 19: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 20: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 21: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        (Continuing the same process for Nodes 1 to 9)

        * Total triangles in the graph = [Total triangles with Node 0] + [Total triangles with Node 1] + [Total triangles with Node 2] ... + [Total triangles with Node 9]

        Find the total number of triangles in the given graph and provide the answer inside brackets [] at the end.
