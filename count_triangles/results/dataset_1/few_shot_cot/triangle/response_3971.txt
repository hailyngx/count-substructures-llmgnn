Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Here is the step-by-step calculation of the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
        - Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
        
10. Node 9:
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
