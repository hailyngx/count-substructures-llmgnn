Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least two nodes greater than 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as it does not have at least two nodes greater than 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least two nodes greater than 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least two nodes greater than 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are not at least two nodes greater than 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them. No triangles formed for both.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
