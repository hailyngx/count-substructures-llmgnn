Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs possible for Node 1 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2, Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skip because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2, 3, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs possible for Node 4 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs possible for Node 6 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 0) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs possible for Node 7 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 9>]
