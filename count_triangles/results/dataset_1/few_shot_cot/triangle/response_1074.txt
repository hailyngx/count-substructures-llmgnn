Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it only has one 1-hop neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 8>.
    
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) = 6.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
