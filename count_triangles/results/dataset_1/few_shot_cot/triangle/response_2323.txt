Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected by the edge (4, 1). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected by the edge (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected by the edge (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected by the edge (2, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected by the edge (4, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected by the edge (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected by the edge (4, 1). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
