Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Not a triangle because 1 and 4 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Not a triangle because 1 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) - Not a triangle because 1 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) - Not a triangle because 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) - Not a triangle because 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) - Not a triangle because 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) - Not a triangle because 9 and 0 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Not a triangle because 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as all other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) - Not a triangle because 3 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Not a triangle because 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) - Not a triangle because 8 and 6 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Not a triangle because 1 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
