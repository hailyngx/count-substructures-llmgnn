Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected because there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 7 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1].

The unique triangle found in the graph is: <0, 4, 7>.
