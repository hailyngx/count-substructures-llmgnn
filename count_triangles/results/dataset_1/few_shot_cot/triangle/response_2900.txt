Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 9 are directly connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are greater than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> Both 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 1 are directly connected as (7, 1) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are greater than 8.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 3 and 9 are directly connected as (3, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
