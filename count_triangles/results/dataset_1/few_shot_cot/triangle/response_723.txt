Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed <5, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * No possible triangle with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
