Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
