Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2}

Response:
Let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 1) - 6 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Now, look for the third node that is 1-hop neighbors of both 1 and 8. Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of both. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Now, look for the third node that is 1-hop neighbors of both 2 and 8. Node 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of both. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Now, look for the third node that is 1-hop neighbors of both 3 and 8. Node 1 is a 1-hop neighbor of both. Therefore, a triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9 do not have any triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
