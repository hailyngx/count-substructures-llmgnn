Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) - Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both greater than 2, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since both 8 and 9 are greater than 4, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but as 6 and 7 are both smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 7), but as 5 and 7 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as 4 is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 4), but as both 7 and 4 are greater than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
