Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the method described in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1 as they are smaller than Node 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9 as they are smaller than Node 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
