Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 3) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> Node 1 and Node 7 are connected, but Node 7 is not a neighbor of Node 0. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 9 are not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are neighbors of 5, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 5) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Node 5 and Node 0 are neighbors, and they are connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are neighbors of 8, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Not connected, no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 8>, and <4, 5, 8>.
