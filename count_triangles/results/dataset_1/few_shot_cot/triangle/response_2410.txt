Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the method explained in the example, we will proceed to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.
