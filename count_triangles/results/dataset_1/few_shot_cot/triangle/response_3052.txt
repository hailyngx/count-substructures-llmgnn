Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<2, 3, 7>, <6, 7, 8>]
