Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
