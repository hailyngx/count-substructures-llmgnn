Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 as it is greater than 0.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
        * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are greater than 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are greater than 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are greater than 4.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are greater than 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are greater than 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are greater than 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * The only pair we could consider is (3, 0), but since 3 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are greater than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
