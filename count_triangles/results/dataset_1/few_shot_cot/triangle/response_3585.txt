Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with the remaining nodes as they are either smaller or not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed as there are no other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
