Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 3, 4>)

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.
    - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<1, 3, 4>)

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0 and 1.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>.
    - No more pairs left to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<7, 8, 9>)

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0 to 7.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs including Nodes 0 to 8.
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
