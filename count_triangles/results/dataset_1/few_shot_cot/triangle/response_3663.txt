Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 6 are also connected as (2, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 5 or 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
