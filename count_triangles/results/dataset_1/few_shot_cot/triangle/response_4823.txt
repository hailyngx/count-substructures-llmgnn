Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <7, 8, 2>)

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Triangle <6, 8, 3>)

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is isolated and has no neighbors to form a triangle with. No triangles possible.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
