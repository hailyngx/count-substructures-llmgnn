Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
