Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
