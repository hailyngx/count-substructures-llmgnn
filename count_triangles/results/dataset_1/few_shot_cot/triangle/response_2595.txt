Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
