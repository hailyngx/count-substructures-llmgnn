Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the same process detailed in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph.

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs as there is no node greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
