Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach mentioned earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 3: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are not enough nodes greater than 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pair (0, 4) as it includes Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Skip as it includes Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs that include Node 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are not enough nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are not enough nodes greater than 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
