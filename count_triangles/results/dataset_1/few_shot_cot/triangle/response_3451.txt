Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Nodes 6, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have enough 1-hop neighbors to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
