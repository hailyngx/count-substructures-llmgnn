Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
