Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles for Node 2: <4, 8, 9>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (0, 5), but since 0 and 5 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * Unique triangles for Node 8: <8, 9, 2>

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with neighbors of smaller node numbers.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3
* [3]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles are <4, 8, 9> and <8, 9, 2>.
