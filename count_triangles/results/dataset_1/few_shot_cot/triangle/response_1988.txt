Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example above to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip since there is only 1 neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * Skip as it has no neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected. No third node connected to both 4 and 7 to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected. No third node connected to both 7 and 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    
* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    
* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    
* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    
* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    
* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
