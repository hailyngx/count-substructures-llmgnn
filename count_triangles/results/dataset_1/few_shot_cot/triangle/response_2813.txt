Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no available triangle pairs, the total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node is 0.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No available pairs for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No available pairs for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No available pairs for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No available pairs for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No available pairs for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
