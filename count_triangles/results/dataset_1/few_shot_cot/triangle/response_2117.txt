Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
