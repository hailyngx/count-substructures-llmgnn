Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 5 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 7 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 3 and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 7.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 9.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 7 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 8.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed as there is no edge between 6 and 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
