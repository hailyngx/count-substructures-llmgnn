Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 3) -> The nodes 3 and 5 are directly connected as (3, 5) and 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no edges connected to it.

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as there is no edge connected to Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> The nodes 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) and 9 is a 1-hop neighbor of 3. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

5. Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no edges connected to it.

6. Node 5:
    No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as all possible triangles are already counted.

7. Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as there are no edges connected to it.

8. Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> The nodes 9 and 8 are directly connected as (9, 8) and both are 1-hop neighbors of 7. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

9. Node 8:
    No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as all possible triangles involving Node 8 are already counted.

10. Node 9:
    No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as all possible triangles involving Node 9 are already counted.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
