Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes since there are not enough larger nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with other nodes since there are not enough larger nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
