Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Node 2 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Node 3 and Node 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Node 4 and Node 5 are 1-hop neighbors of Node 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 2, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Node 8 and Node 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of Node 4, and they are connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 8 do not have enough nodes to form triangles with at least one triangle inequality, so we skip them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
