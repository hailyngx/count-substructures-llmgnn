Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, we will now count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 3) -> Self-loop, so triangle formed with 0, 3.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> Not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to not having at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 11.

Therefore, there are [11] triangles in the given graph.
