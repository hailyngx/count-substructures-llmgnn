Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 5 are also connected as (0, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as (2, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as (2, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 6 to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 8 to form triangles with.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
