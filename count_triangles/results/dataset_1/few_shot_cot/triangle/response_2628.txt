Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 1 are also connected as (7, 1) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair with 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip Pairs with 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip Pairs with 0,1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 doesn't have any neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip Pairs with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
