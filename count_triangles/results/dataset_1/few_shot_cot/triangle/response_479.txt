Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) - 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1 or 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 5) - 6 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 
        * (2, 3, 6)
        * (2, 6, 7)
        * (2, 5, 6)
        * (3, 5, 6)
        * (5, 6, 7)
        * (5, 6, 8)
        * (5, 7, 8)

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 and 8 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 7 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
