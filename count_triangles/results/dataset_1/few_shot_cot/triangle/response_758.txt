Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
