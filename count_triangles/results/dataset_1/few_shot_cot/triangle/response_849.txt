Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process from the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) - 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as (0, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip this node as there are no triangles involving Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip the pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (7, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
