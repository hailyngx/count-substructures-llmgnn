Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph given.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected by an edge. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 3 are also connected. 
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 1 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are also connected.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 is isolated with no edges. No triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because they do not have enough nodes larger than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
