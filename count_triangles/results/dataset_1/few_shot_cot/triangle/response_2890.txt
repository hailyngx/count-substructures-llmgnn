Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Not a triangle because 1 and 2 are not connected.
            * Pair 2: (1, 3) - Not a triangle because 1 and 3 are not connected.
            * Pair 3: (1, 6) - Not a triangle because 1 and 6 are not connected.
            * Pair 4: (1, 7) - Not a triangle because 1 and 7 are not connected.
            * Pair 5: (1, 9) - Not a triangle because 1 and 9 are not connected.
            * Pair 6: (2, 3) - Not a triangle because 2 and 3 are not connected.
            * Pair 7: (2, 6) - Not a triangle because 2 and 6 are not connected.
            * Pair 8: (2, 7) - Triangle formed <0, 2, 7>.
            * Pair 9: (2, 9) - Not a triangle because 2 and 9 are not connected.
            * Pair 10: (3, 6) - Not a triangle because 3 and 6 are not connected.
            * Pair 11: (3, 7) - Not a triangle because 3 and 7 are not connected.
            * Pair 12: (3, 9) - Not a triangle because 3 and 9 are not connected.
            * Pair 13: (6, 7) - Not a triangle because 6 and 7 are not connected.
            * Pair 14: (6, 9) - Not a triangle because 6 and 9 are not connected.
            * Pair 15: (7, 9) - Not a triangle because 7 and 9 are not connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 as they are smaller than 1.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Not a triangle because 3 and 6 are not connected.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Not a triangle because 3 and 8 are not connected.
            * Pair 3: (6, 8) - Not a triangle because 6 and 8 are not connected.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 4:
            * There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 5:
            * There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 8:
            * There are no triangles that can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. Total triangles: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
