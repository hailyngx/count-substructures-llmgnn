Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller.
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
