Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process used in the example above to count triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 6>
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 3, 7> 
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

2. Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

4. Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

5. Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

6. Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there are no pairs to consider where these nodes are the smallest numbered node.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 triangles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [5].
