Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as (1, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 4 are also connected as (9, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 8 are also connected as (9, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 4 as it is smaller.
    * No other pairs for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
