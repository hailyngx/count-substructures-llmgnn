Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Triangle formed <0, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Triangle formed <2, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the starting node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the starting node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the starting node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the starting node.

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the starting node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
