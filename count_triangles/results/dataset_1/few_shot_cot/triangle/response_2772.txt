Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 2, 3>
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Skipped, as 2 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> Skipped, as 3 is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4: <0, 3, 9>
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6: <0, 8, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 3, 4>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 5, 8>
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0: <0, 6, 8>
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <5, 6, 8>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) -> Skipped, as 0 is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <0, 7, 9>
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9: <6, 7, 9>
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
