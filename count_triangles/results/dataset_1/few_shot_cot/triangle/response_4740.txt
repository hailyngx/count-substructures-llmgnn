Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Node 0 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> Node 0 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> Node 1 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Node 2 and Node 5 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Node 2 and Node 6 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are not connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Node 2 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Node 2 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Node 3 and Node 9 are 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Node 6 and Node 7 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Node 6 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Node 7 and Node 8 are both 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangles formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> Node 7 and Node 9 are both 1-hop neighbors, and they are connected. No triangles formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
