Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs found for Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No pairs found for Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No pairs found for Node 8 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs found for Node 9 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
