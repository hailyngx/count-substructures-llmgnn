Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 4), but since 2 and 4 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 and 8 are both smaller than 5, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 2), but since 1 and 2 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (2, 4), but since 2 and 4 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
