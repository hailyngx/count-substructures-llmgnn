Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no other nodes that can form a triangle with it.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) - Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no other nodes that can form a triangle with it.

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as they have been covered when counting for Node 2.

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as they have been covered when counting for Node 2.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no other nodes that can form a triangle with it.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9 as they have been covered when counting for Node 2.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 4 (Node 2)
  
Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
