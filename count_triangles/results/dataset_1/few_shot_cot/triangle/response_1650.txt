Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6, Node 7:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 8:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no other connected nodes.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, [5] triangles are present in the given graph.
