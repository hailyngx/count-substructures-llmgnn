Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as the other nodes are all smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
