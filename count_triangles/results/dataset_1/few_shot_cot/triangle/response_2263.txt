Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided, I will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as its only neighbor is smaller in number. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider as its only neighbor is smaller in number. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as its only neighbor is smaller in number. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as its only neighbor is smaller in number. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as its only neighbor is smaller in number. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
