Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to check for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to check for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) -> 4 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 0 are directly connected as (4, 0) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to check for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to check for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to check for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to check for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to check for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
