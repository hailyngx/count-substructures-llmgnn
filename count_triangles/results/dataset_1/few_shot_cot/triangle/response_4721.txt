Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3, 4, and 5:
    * Skipped because they do not have any 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 5, as it is smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 8 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 6, as it is smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
