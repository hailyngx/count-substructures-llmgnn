Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also directly connected as (1, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip Node 0 and 1.
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, and 2.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 6, 0>, <8, 9, 6>]
