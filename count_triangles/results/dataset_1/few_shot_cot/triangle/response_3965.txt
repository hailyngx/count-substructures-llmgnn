Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip pair with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No edges connected to Node 1, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no larger nodes it can form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 or 9 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no larger nodes it can form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 5 as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
