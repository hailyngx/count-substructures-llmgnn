Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * Only smaller nodes connected to 1. Skip.

    * Node 2:
        * Only smaller nodes connected to 2. Skip.

    * Node 3:
        * Only smaller nodes connected to 3. Skip.

    * Node 4:
        * Only smaller nodes connected to 4. Skip.

    * Node 5:
        * Skip 1 and only consider larger nodes.
        * No pair to consider. No triangle formed.

    * Node 6:
        * Skip 2, 3, 4, and 5.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 7:
        * Skip 3, 4, 5, and 6.
        * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected, 9, 0, and 7 form a triangle.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip 4, 5, 6, and 7.
        * No pair to consider. No triangle formed.

    * Node 9:
        * Skip 5, 6, 7, and 8.
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (1, 2). Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 9) = 6.

    Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
