Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 5 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
