Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example above to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed since 2, 4, and 0 are all connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed since 2, 5, and 0 are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed since 4, 5, and 1 are all connected.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with this pair.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> No triangle can be formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 and Node 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as 3 and 8 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> Triangle formed since 3, 9, and 2 are all connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle can be formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * No further pairs to consider, only with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 8) -> No triangle can be formed as 8 is not connected to 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as no pairs exist with both nodes greater than each respective node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
