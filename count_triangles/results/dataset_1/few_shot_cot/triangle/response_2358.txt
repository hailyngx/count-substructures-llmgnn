Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> Both 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> Both 9 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Both 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 6) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
