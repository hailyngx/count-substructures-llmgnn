Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) - 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 and connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) - 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 8 but not connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:  
[<3, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 7>]
