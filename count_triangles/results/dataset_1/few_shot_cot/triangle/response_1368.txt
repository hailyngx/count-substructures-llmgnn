Response:
Following the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes using the provided information. 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. 
    * No triangles possible for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible for Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles possible for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. 
    * No triangles possible for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles possible for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
