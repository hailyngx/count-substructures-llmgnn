Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 2 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Node 1 since it is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 since they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
