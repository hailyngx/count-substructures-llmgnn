Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2 [<4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 9>]

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of triangles = [3].
