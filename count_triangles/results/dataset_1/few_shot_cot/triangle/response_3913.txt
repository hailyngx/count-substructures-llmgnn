Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 0 and 2 are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 2) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 0 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 2 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (3, 4), but since 3 and 4 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
