Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No more pairs to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs to check.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no 1-hop neighbor pairs connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
