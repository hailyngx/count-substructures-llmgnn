Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
            * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

        Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
