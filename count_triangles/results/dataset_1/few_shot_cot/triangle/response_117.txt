Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 connected to each other.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
  * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
  * No other pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other. No triangles formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 connected to each other.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
  * No triangles can be formed as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected to each other for each of these nodes.
  * Total triangles with Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
