Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step: 

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs since there is only one 1-hop neighbor for Node 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 5 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Both 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
