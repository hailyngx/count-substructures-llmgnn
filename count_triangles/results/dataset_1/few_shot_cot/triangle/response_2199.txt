Response:
Following the method described in the example provided, let's determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 5: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected. No triangle formed as the third node is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: [0]

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
