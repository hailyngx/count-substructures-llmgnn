Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no edges connected to Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors of Node 5.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors of Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors of Node 8.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no 2-hop neighbors of Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
