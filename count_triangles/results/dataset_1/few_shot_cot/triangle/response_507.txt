Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Since there are no edges connected to or from Node 3, no triangles can be formed with it.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 7), but since 1 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
