Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step as applied to each node in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as (2, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped because they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [3].
