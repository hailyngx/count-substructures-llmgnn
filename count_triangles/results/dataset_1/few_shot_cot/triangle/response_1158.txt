Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) <0, 2, 5> -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 2). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (8, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there are no other nodes greater than 8 and 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
