Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 1.

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 3.

- Node 4:
    - Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - No possible triangles with nodes greater than 8.

- Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
