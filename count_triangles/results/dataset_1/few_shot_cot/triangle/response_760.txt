Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Neither 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, nor are they directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

        Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
