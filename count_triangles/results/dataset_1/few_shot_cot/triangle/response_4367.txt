Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the same procedure as the example provided earlier, we will now count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (3, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (3, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 7: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 8: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 9: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 10: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

- Node 1:
    - The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both smaller than 1, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected (4, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 4:
    - The only pair we could consider is (6, 8), but since 6 and 8 are both smaller than 4, this pair is skipped.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

- Node 6:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

- Node 7:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped as there are no pairs with larger nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is: [6] 
The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 8>.
