Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (1, 0, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [1] <0, 1, 6>.
