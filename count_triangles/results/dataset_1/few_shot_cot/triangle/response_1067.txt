Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Skip (1, 2) and (1, 3) as they are smaller than 1.
            * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip (1, 2) as it is smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 4.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Nodes 6, 7, 9:
            * Skipped as they do not have at least two nodes greater than them to form triangles.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip (1, 8) as it is smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 1 and 9 are also connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

        Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
