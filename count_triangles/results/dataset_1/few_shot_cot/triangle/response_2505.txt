Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 2, and 6. <0, 2, 6>
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 0, 5, and 6. <0, 5, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 since it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 2, and 6. <1, 2, 6>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 since they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle as the remaining nodes are not 1-hop neighbors or directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed with nodes 1, 3, and 6. <1, 3, 6>
    * No other valid pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No valid pairs to form a triangle as the remaining nodes are not 1-hop neighbors or directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Triangle formed with nodes 5, 6, and 9. <5, 6, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

The remaining nodes, 6, 7, 8, and 9, do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
