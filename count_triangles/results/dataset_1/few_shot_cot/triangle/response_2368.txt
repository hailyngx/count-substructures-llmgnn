Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided earlier, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (0, 1, 2).
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1).
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (1, 3, 4).
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (2, 3).
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes (3, 5).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
