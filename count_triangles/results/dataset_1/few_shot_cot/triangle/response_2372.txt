Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, form a triangle with Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected, form a triangle with Node 3.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected, form a triangle with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped due to not having enough nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
