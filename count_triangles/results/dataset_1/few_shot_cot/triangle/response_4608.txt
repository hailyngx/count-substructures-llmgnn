Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip pair (0, 6) and (0, 7) as they involve Node 0.
    - Skip pair (2, 6) as 2 is smaller than 6.
    - Skip pair (2, 7) as 2 is smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0
      
- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

- Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Skip pair (9, 6) as 9 is smaller than 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip pair (0, 1) as both are smaller than 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
