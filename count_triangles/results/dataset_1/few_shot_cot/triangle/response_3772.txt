Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    No 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed.

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 7:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    No triangles can be formed as there are no common 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
