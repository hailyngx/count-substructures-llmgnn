Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip 0-5, as they form an edge. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they are smaller than Node 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
