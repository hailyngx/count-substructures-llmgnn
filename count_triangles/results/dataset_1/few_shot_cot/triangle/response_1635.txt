Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example provided, let's count the triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 2 are not connected.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 6>.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
