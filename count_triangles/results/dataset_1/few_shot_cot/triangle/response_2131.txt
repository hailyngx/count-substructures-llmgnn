Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 1 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 2 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 4 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 6 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) â€“ 9 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (Note: This is a triangle with a self-loop.)

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
