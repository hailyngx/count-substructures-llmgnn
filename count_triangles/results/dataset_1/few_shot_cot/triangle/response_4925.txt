Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - No other pairs to consider.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9: 
    - No pairs to consider due to smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
