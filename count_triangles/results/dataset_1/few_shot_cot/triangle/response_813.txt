Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No pairs possible to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No pairs possible to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No pairs possible to form a triangle.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, or 7.
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 8, or 3 since they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
