Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as there are no other nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
