Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example given:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 3) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
