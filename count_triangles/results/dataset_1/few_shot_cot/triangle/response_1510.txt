Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5}

Response:
Following the process described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Nodes 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 1

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

[<3, 5, 9>]
