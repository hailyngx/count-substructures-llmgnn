Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle <0, 2, 6> is formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> Triangle <1, 2, 6> is formed.
            * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle <2, 5, 9> is formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Triangle <3, 5, 9> is formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle <5, 6, 7> is formed.
            * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Nodes 8 and 9:
            * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 6.

        Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
        
        The unique triangles found are:
        <0, 2, 4>
        <0, 2, 6>
        <1, 2, 6>
        <2, 5, 9>
        <3, 5, 9>
        <5, 6, 7>
