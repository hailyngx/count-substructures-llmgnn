Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph by considering each node as the smallest numbered node and then summing up the total triangles formed.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4, Node 5, Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with higher-numbered nodes.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pair available to form a triangle with higher-numbered nodes.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
