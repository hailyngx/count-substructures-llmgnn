Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6)

Response:
Following the methodology mentioned in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs as they are all smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with 5 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Alright, let's continue this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
