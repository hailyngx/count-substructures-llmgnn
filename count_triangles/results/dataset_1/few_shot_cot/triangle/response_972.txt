Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the given graph, we will follow the step-by-step process for each node as demonstrated in the previous example. 

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip pairs involving Node 0 because it's smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs for Node 1 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No other pairs for Node 2 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No other pairs for Node 3 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with this node.

* Node 5:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs for Node 5 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No other pairs for Node 6 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No other pairs for Node 7 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Skip pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    - No other pairs for Node 8 as all 1-hop neighbors are smaller nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - No 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with this node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
