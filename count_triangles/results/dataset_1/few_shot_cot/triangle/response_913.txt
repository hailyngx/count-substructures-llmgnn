Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected, forming a triangle with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
