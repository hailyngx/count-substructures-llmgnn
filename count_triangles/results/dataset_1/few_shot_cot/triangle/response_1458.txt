Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with Node 7, which is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles as Node 5 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles as Node 6 only has 1 neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 2, which are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4, which are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1, which is smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
