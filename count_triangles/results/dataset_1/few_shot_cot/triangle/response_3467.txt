Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Both 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are directly connected as (1, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0. They are directly connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 9), but since 7 and 9 are both greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs where the other node is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2. They are directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs where the other node is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs where the other node is smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both greater than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
