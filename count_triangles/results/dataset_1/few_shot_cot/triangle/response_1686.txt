Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we can count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles as no other node has a greater number.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles as no other node has a greater number.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left for triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left for triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left for triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left for triangles.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles as no other node has a greater number.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
