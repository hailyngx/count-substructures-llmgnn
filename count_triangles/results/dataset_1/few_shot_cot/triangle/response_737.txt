Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Node 4 has no neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
