Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any other nodes as they are greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 7 as it is greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no higher numbered nodes to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
