Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes nodes with lower numbers as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 2) - 8 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) - 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
