Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example above to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Repeat the same process as Node 0 for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No pairs available to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs involving Node 4 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs involving Node 6 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
