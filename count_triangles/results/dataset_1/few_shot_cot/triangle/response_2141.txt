Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as (2, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (3, 5). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as (7, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
These triangles are <0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, and <2, 7, 9>.
