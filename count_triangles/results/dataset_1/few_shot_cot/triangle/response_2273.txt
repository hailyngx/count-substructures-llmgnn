Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
    - Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>
    - Pair 4: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>
    - Pair 6: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed. 
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip (1, 4) and (1, 9) as smaller nodes are involved.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip pair with Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
    - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skip due to smaller node involvement or lack of enough nodes.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
