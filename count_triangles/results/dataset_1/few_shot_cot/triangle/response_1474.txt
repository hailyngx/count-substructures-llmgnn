Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 0.
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 8 are also connected as (0, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 3 are also connected as (1, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 7 are also connected as (1, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 8 are also connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 9 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 3), but since 1 and 3 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 6), but since 5 and 6 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
