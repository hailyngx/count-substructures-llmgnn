Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 5 and 9 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (0, 3) -> Both 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 3 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (0, 4) -> Both 0 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 4 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 4 and 5 are connected. Triangle formed.
    
Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
