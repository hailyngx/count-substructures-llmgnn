Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 3 are connected in the graph. No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 5 are connected in the graph. No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs can form triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 8 are connected in the graph. No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs of 1-hop neighbors of Node 9 are connected in the graph. No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
