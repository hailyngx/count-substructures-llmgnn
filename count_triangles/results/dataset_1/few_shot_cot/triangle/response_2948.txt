Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example, we will count the triangles for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 8) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
