Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as (2, 4). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are directly connected as (2, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No edges to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as (5, 6). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No edges to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are directly connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped due to lack of nodes for triangle formation.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
