Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Possible triangle.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
