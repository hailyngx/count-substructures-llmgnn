Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example above, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no connections, there can be no triangles involving Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Already calculated above as a separate case under Node 0.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> Already calculated above as a separate case under Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No more pairs left to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No more pairs left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
