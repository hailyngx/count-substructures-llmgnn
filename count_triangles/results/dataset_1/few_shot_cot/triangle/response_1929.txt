Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected as (2, 3) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangle can be formed with Node 1. Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 9 are directly connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as (9, 0) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
