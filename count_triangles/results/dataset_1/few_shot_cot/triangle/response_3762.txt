Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No more pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no other nodes larger than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than Node 3.
    * No more pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No more pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no other nodes larger than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
