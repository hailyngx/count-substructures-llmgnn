Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 3 as it is a greater neighbor of Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is a smaller neighbor of Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are all smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 8 as it is a greater neighbor of Node 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3 as they are all smaller than 7.
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is a greater neighbor of Node 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4
        
Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
