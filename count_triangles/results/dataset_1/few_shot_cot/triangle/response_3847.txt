Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the method explained in the previous example, let's compute the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No edges connected to Node 4, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not connected in the graph. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are also connected in the graph.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
