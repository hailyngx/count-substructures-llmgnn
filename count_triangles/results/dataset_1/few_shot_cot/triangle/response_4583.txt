Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * No valid pairs available for Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * No edges connected to Node 5, so no triangles can be formed.

* Node 6:
  * No valid pairs available for Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * No valid pairs available for Node 7.

* Node 8:
  * No valid pairs available for Node 8.

* Node 9:
  * No valid pairs available for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
