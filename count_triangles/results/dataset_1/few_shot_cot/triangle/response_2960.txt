Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3}

Response:
Following the process explained in the example provided, let's count the triangles step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 2, as they are smaller than Node 0.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 2) -> 7 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
