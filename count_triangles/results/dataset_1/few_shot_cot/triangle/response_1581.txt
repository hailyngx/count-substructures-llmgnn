Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) - Node 9 is not directly connected to 6 or 7, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Node 0 and 2 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 5) - Node 0 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) - Node 0 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) - Node 2 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) - Node 2 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) - Node 5, and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9), but Node 7 is not directly connected to either.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
