1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step triangle counting process for each node in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. 
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair involving Nodes smaller than 2.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
            * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
            * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
