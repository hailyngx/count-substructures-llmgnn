Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 0 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip nodes without any neighbors to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
