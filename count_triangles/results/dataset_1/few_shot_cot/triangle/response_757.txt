Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the graph provided:

* Node 0:
    No possible triangles as Node 0 has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    No triangles involving Node 1 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 2:
    No possible triangles involving Node 2 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    No triangles involving Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 5:
    No possible triangles involving Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 6:
    No possible triangles involving Node 6 as Node 6 has no neighbors.

* Node 7:
    No possible triangles involving Node 7 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 8:
    No triangles involving Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

* Node 9:
    No possible triangles involving Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors connected.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 3)
* Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
