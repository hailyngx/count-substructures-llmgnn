Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Triangle 1: <0, 6, 9> -> Node 0 is connected to Nodes 6 and 9, and Nodes 6 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles formed with Node 3 as smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node that weren't already counted.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Triangle 1: <1, 6, 8> -> Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6, and Nodes 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Triangle 2: <7, 8, 9> -> Node 8 is connected to Nodes 7 and 9, and Nodes 7 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
