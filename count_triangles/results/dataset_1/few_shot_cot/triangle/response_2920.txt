Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 3
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 4
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 5
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8 and Node 9
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
