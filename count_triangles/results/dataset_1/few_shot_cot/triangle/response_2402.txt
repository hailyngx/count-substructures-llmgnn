Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}

1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the provided instructions, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph step by step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 1) -> 8 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip Node 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip Node 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip Node 5 and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
