Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 2, 8>)

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 7 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<2, 6, 7>)

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<3, 6, 7>)

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with other nodes. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
