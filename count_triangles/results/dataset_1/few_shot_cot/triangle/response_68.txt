Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are not connected because (5, 0) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No pair to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 1. No triangle formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no other nodes greater than 6. No triangle formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 3 as they are smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
