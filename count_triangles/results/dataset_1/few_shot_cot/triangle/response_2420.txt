Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the method outlined in the example provided, here are the steps to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected because (5, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not connected because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there is only one 1-hop neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
