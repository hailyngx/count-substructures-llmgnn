Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 0.
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 1.

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 3.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 1 and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 6.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 8.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 8.

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pair with Nodes 2 as it is smaller than 9.
            * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 4.

        Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
