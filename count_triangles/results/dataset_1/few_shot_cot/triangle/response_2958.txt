Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same process explained in the example, let's count the triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 9 are connected as (0, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 2 are connected as (1, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 3 and 7 are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 2 and 4 are connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 5 are connected as (0, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 5 and 6 are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 9, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 7, 5>, <2, 6, 4>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, and <5, 6, 9>.
