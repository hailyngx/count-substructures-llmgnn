Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are also connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) = 10.
