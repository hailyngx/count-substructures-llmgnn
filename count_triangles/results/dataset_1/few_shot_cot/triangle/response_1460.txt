Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (5, 0) -> We skip this pair as we already counted it with node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - No pairs to form triangles with higher-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - No new triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - No new triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - No new triangles can be formed with higher-numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Not enough nodes to form triangles with higher-numbered nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
