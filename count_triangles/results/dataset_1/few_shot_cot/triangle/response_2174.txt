Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example earlier, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 0.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 1.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 3.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than Node 8.
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as there are no nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [0].
