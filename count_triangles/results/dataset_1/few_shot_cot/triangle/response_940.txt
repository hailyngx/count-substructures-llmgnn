Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle <0, 2, 4> formed.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (7, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - No possible triangle with two other nodes greater than 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - Similar to the above analysis, there are no triangles involving these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [1].
