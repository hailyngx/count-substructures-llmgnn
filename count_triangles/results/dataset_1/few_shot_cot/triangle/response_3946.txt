Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 2 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 because it does not have any neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * All possible pairs involving Node 5 have already been covered when considering Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * All possible pairs involving Node 7 have already been covered when considering Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * All possible pairs involving Node 8 have already been covered when considering Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
