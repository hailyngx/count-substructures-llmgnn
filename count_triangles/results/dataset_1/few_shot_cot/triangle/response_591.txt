Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same methodology as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 8 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 and 9 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs to form triangles with nodes greater than 8 and 9.

Calculating the total triangles in the graph:
Total triangles = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5> and <3, 4, 9>.
