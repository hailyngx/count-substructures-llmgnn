Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed <0, 1, 2>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed <2, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangle formed involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs for Node 4 to form a triangle.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. No triangle formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Triangle formed <6, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs involving Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No triangle formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs for Node 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
