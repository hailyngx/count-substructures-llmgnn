Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are not enough possible pairs.

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are not enough possible pairs.

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 due to a lack of suitable pairs.

* Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are not enough possible pairs.

* Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are not enough possible pairs.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
