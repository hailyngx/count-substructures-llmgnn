Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 has no 1-hop neighbors. No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 6) -> 0 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 3), but since 1 and 3 are both smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
