Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the initial example, here are the triangles found for each node:

* Node 0:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  * Unique triangles involving Node 1: <1, 4, 9>

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
  * Unique triangles involving Node 2: <2, 4, 9>

* Node 3:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.
Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
