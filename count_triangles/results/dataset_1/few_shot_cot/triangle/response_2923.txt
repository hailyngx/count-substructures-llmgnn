Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the example shown for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 1 since it's greater than 0.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are directly connected. No other node to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 2 or higher nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 3 or higher nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 5 or higher nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipped as there are no edges connected to Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 7 or higher nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as there are no edges connected to Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 8 or higher nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 9 since it's greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as there are no pairs that include nodes greater than 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
