Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 4 as they are greater than 0.
    * No triangles found with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as (2, 6) from the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 8, or 1 as they are greater than 2.
    * No triangles found with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * No triangles found with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6 or 7 as they are greater than 4.
    * No triangles found with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    No edges connected to Node 5, therefore no triangles with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles found with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No edges connected to Node 7, therefore no triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 9 as it is greater than 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * No triangles found with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles found with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is [1] triangle in the given graph.
