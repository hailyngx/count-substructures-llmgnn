Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * No possible triangles as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * No possible triangles as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * No possible triangles as there are not enough 1-hop neighbors.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
