Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also directly connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) -> 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (6, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also directly connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also directly connected as (7, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also directly connected as (4, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the graph.
