Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Nodes 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors and connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 2: No triangles can be formed with Node 2.
* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> Nodes 3, 5, and 6 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and connected. Triangle formed. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3
* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Nodes 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> Nodes 2, 4, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other but only 2 and 4 are connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3, 4, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 5: 
    * All possible pairs including Node 5 have been covered in previous calculations.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0
* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3, 6, and 9 are all 1-hop neighbors of each other and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1
* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
* Node 9:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
