Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No valid triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No valid triangles involving Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7 and are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No valid triangles involving Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles involving Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
