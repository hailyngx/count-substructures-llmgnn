Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example provided:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 and Node 1 as they are also connected to Node 0.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed as Node 6 is not directly connected to Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> No triangle formed as Node 7 is not directly connected to Nodes 0 and 1.
    - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 8 as they are also connected to Node 0.
    - Pair 5: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 and Node 9 as they are also connected to Node 0.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

- Node 1:
    - Skip pairs with Node 0 as it's smaller.
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as Node 1, 2, and 8 are not pairwise connected.
    - Pair 2: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed as Node 1, 2, and 9 are not pairwise connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller.
    - No triangles to form with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - No triangles to form with Node 3 as it has no neighbors.

- Node 4:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    - No triangles to form with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. 
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as Node 5, 6, and 7 are not pairwise connected.
    - Pair 2: (6, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 5, 6, and 8 as they are pairwise connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 5.
    - No triangles to form with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
    - No triangles to form with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 8:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.
    - No triangles to form with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 9:
    - Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    - No triangles to form with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, and <5, 6, 8>. Thus, the final answer is [4].
