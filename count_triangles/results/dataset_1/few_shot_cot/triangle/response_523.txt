Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pair with Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2, as they are smaller than 3.
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 8:
    * The remaining nodes do not have enough distinct neighbors to form triangles.

Therefore, the triangles found in the graph are:
[<0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>]

Counting the total, we have:
[4] triangles in the given graph.
