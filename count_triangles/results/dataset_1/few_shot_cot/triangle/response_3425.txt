Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no nodes greater than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no nodes greater than 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
