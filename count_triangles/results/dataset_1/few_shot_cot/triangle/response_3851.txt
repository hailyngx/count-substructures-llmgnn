Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip, as there are no 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as (3, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected with edge (5, 6).
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected with edge (5, 7).
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip, as there are no 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 3:
    * Skip, as there are no 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 4:
    * Skip, as there are no 2-hop neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * Skip, as all other nodes are smaller than 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip, as all other nodes are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip, as all other nodes are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip, as all other nodes are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip, as all other nodes are smaller than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1)
* Final Answer: [2]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
