Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 3) - Both 6 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 3 are also connected as (6, 3) and (3, 5).
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7, 8, and 9 as they are larger than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 8 and 9 as they are larger than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 9 as it is larger than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 5)
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [1].
