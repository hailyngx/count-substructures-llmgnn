Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider with other nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider with other nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider with other nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider with other nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
