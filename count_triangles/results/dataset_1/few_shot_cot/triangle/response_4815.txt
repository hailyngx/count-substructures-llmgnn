Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example above, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Both 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Both 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Only one pair to consider, which was already examined when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Only one pair to consider, which was already examined when looking at Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
