Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process to count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 because it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 because there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.

    * Pair 11: (4, 6) -> Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 13: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 14: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 15: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 16: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 7

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 7 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 13.

Therefore, there are [13] triangles in the given graph.
