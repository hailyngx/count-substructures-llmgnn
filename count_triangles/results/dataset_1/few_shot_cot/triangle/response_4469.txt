Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * No pairs remaining to form a triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other pairs remaining to form a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    * No pairs remaining to form a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 to Node 9: 
    * Following a similar process as above for each node:
        * Node 5: Total triangles = 0
        * Node 6: Total triangles = 0
        * Node 7: Total triangles = 0
        * Node 8: Total triangles = 0
        * Node 9: Total triangles = 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
