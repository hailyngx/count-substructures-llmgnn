Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
