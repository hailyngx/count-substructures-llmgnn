Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No more triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
