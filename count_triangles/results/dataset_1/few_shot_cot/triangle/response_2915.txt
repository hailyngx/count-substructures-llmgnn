Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process for counting triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not connected because (2, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected because (6, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected because (4, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 9 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
