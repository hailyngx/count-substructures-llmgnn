Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
  * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
  * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list forming a triangle.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * The only pair we could consider is (3, 6), but as 3 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Calculating the total number of triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 2, 6>, and <6, 2, 9>.
