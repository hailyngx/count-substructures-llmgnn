Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it's smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 6 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 5 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (5, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 2 are also connected as (9, 2) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
