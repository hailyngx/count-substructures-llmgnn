Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    No neighbors to form triangles with.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with only two neighbors.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected to form a triangle.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    Since there are not at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9, no triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
