1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the method shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1 and no triangle can be formed with other nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
