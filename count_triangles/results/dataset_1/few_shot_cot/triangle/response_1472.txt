Response:
Following the steps outlined in the initial example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (0, 4) and (0, 8). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1 (<0, 5, 2>).

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) and (1, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (1, 4) and (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>).

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (5, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 4) and (3, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 4) and (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2 (<3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>).

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

Continuing the process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but there is no edge between them in the given list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Nodes 8 or 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
