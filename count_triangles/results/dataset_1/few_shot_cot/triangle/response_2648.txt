Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (1, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 8) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
