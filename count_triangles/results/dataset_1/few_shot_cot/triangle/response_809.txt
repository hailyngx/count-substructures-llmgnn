Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 3: <0, 1, 3>
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 8: <0, 3, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 3 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as there is no pair with nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 and Node 7: <4, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, 7 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 4), but since 4 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 7>]

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
