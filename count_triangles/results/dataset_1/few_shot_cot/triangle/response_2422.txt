Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described earlier, we will count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 4, and 7 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
