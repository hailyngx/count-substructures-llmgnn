Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
