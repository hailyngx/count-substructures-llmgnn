Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 because it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Node 4 is isolated and does not form any triangles.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 0 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
