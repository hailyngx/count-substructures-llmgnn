Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip this node as it doesn't have at least 2 nodes greater than itself to form a triangle.

* Node 1:
    * Skip this node as it doesn't have at least 2 nodes greater than itself to form a triangle.

* Node 2:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (0) as it's smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip the remaining pairs involving 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (2) as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip the remaining pairs involving 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (2, 3) as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip the remaining pairs involving 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (2, 4) as they are smaller than 5.
    * Skip this node as it doesn't have at least 2 nodes greater than itself to form a triangle.

* Node 6:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (1) as it's smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 1) -> 3 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Skip the remaining pairs involving 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip 1-hop neighbors (2, 5) as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 1) -> 9 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip the remaining pairs involving 7.

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skip these nodes as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Nodes 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
