Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 but not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> Self-loop on node 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 2 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
