Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Since Node 1 has no neighbors, no triangle can be formed with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 4) -> Both 5 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 4 are directly connected as (5, 4) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has no neighbors, so no triangle can be formed with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as (5, 7) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are directly connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Both 9 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 5 are directly connected as (9, 5) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6
Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
