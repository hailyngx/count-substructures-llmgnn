Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 7 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 7 and 8 are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Continuing this process for Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph. 
The unique triangles found are as follows: 
[<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 7>]
