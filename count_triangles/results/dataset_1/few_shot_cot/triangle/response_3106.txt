Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Let's find the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node's 1-hop neighbor set:

        * Node 0:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 because it only has 1 neighbor.

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 5: (5, 3) -> 5 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 2:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 because it only has 2 neighbors.

        * Node 3:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 because it only has 2 neighbors.

        * Node 4:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 because it only has 1 neighbor.

        * Node 5:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 because all its 1-hop neighbors are already processed. 

        * Node 6:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 because it only has 1 neighbor.

        * Node 7:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 because it only has 2 neighbors.

        * Node 8:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 because it only has 1 neighbor.

        * Node 9:
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 because it only has 1 neighbor.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 1)
        
        Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
