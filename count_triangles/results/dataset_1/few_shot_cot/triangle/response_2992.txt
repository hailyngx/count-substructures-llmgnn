Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example with the provided graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 2:
            * No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 3:
            * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 4:
            * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 5:
            * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 6:
            * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 7:
            * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * No more possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

        * Node 9:
            * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) = 1.

        Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
