Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, let's count the triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 9 are not connected.
    * Skipping pairs with Node 1, as it is smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipping all pairs as Node 1 is the smallest.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Node 2 has no 2-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> No triangle formed as 9 and 0 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as it has no neighbors.

* Node 7:
    * Skipping all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> No triangle formed as 0 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has one neighbor.

Summarizing the triangles:
No triangles can be formed in this graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
