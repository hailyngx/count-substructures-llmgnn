Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Both 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 2 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 2 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> Both 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 0 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 6 as it is smaller than 8.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 9.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

        Therefore, there are 12 triangles in the given graph.
