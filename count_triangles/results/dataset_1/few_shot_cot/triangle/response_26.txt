Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 5 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Not a triangle, as 5 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> Not a triangle, as 0 and 2 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 2: (0, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 0 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 7 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Not a triangle, as 2 and 5 are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Not a triangle, as 4 and 9 are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with the available neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
