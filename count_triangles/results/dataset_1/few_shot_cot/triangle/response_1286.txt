Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
    - Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
    - Pair 4: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

2. **Node 1:**
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle can be formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

4. **Node 3:**
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 0) -> Triangle formed: <4, 0, 5>
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> Triangle formed: <4, 2, 5>
    - Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

6. **Node 5:**
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - No new triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Node 8:**
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

10. **Node 9:**
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summing up the triangles for each node:
Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
