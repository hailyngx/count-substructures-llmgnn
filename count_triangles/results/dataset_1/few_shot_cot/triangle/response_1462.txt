Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with 1 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with 2 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 2-hop neighbors to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with 5 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: No triangle formed with 6 as the smallest node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
