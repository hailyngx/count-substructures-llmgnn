Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example given above, let's find the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair with Node 0 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair to form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected. No other pair with Node 3 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair to form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5 and Node 6:
    * Node 5 and Node 6 are isolated nodes without any connections. No triangles can be formed with them.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair with Node 7 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair with Node 8 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. No other pair with Node 9 to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
