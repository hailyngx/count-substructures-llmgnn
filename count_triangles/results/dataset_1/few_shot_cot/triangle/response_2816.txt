Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) -> Node 2 is not connected to Node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle can be formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
