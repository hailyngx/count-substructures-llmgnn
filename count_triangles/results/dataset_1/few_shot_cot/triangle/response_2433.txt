Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node:

* Node 0:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 since they are greater than 0.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 3: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1 and are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 4, 6, or 9 since they are greater than 2.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Since Node 3 has no neighbors, no triangles can be formed with it.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 6 or 8 since they are greater than 4.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 6 or 8 since they are greater than 5.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 7 or 9 since they are greater than 6.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pair that includes nodes 8 or 9 since they are greater than 7.
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
