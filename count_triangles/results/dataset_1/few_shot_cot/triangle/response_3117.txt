Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) - 0 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 0 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No neighbors to form triangles with for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 3 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 5 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * Skip node 0 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * All applicable pairs with Node 0, 1, and 6 have been covered previously.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.


Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
