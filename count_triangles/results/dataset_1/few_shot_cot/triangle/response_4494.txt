Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step method as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9). No other nodes to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are connected as (7, 9). No other nodes to complete the triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
