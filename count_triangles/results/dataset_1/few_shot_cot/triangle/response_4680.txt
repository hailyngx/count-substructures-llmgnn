Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided and applying it to each node in the graph given:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
        * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 1:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 1.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 2:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 2.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
        * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 4:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 6:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 6.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 7.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 8:
        * There are no triangles involving Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 9:
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 7.
        * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9.
        * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 3

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 3 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [9].
