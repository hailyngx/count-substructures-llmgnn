Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0. Triangle <0, 2, 4>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1. Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2. Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2. Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 2. Triangle <2, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 3. Triangle <3, 6, 8>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4. Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
