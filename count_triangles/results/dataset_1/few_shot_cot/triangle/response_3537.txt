Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Triangle formed as 2, 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed as 3, 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Triangle formed as 5, 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed as 5, 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3 and connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Nodes 4 and 7:
    * Skipped because there are no edges connected to these nodes.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
