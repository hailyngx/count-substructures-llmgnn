Response:
Following the process outlined in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 2) -> 3 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs can be considered as Node 6 does not have 2 or more higher-numbered neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Since there are no triangles that involve Nodes 8 and 9 with 2 higher-numbered nodes, we skip these calculations.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 5 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
