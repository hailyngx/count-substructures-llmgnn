Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider as they are all smaller than 7.
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
