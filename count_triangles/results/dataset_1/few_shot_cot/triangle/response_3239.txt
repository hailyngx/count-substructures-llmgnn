Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the procedure described in the example with step-by-step triangle counting for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 6 are also connected as (5, 6) from the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) from the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as there are no edges connected to it.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 8 are also connected as (6, 8) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) from the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
