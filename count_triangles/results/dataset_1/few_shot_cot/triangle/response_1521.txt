Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected in the edge list. 
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible for Node 7 as there are no pairs of greater nodes connected to Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No triangles possible for Node 9 as there are no pairs of greater nodes connected to Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10.

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
