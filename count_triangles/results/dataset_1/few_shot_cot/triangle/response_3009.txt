Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs left for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No more pairs for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other pairs left for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
