Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided for the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
            * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
            * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 0 are also connected. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there are no nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

    Summarizing the triangles:
    * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 4.

    Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
