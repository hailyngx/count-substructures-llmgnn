Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (4, 5, 8) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as (5, 9, 0) is a triangle.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as (4, 8, 9) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as (1, 8, 9) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 8 as (2, 4, 8) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (6, 9) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (0, 5, 9) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Forms a triangle with Node 0 as (0, 5, 8) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (7, 9) is not in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 9 as (3, 6, 9) is a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 6 as (5, 6, 7) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Does not form a triangle as (5, 9) is already counted with 0 as the smallest numbered node (0, 5, 9).
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as (1, 8, 9) is a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Calculating the total number of triangles by adding the triangles for each node:
[3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 10]

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.
