Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for each node in the given graph, we find the following triangle counts:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 0.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 are connected, forming a triangle with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as they either have no connections or all connected nodes are smaller than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
