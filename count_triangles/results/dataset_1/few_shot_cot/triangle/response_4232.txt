Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also directly connected as (7, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 1 has no neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider as Node 2 has only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 9 are also directly connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No pairs with greater numbered nodes available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs with greater numbered nodes available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 9 are also directly connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs with greater numbered nodes available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>]
