Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as (3, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected as there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as (4, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (9, 3) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
