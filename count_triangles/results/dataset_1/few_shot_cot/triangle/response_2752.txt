Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the process laid out in the example, let's determine the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed using Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
