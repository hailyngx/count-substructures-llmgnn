Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 5, 8}

Response:
