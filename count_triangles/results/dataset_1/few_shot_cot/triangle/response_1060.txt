Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided earlier, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * No triangles involving Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles involving Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles involving Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles involving Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles involving Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No triangles involving Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
