Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No additional triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No additional triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No additional triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No additional triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
