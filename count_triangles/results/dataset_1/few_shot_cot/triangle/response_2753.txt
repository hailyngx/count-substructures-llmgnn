Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Both 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Both 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) - Both 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) - Both 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs can be considered.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with larger numbered nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
