Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No valid triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
