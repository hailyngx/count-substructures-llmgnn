Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process explained in the example with the provided graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected.
        * No more pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected.
        * No more pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected.
        * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected.
        * No more pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
        * No more pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 4.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 5, 7, and 8:
        * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than 5, 7, and 8, respectively.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected.
        * No more pairs to consider.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Nodes 7, 8:
        * Skipped for the same reason as above.

    * Node 9:
        * No valid pairs to consider with nodes greater than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Putting all the unique triangles found in the graph in brackets:
[<1, 0, 2>, <3, 1, 6>, <3, 2, 6>]
