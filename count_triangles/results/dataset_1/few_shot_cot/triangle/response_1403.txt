Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0: Skipped as it has no edges.

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are connected as (5, 8) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 1.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected as (6, 8) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 3.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4: Skipped as it has no edges.

* Node 5:
    - Can't form any triangle as there is only one edge (1, 5) connected to Node 5.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 6.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    - Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected as (2, 8) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 7.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the list. No other nodes to form triangles with Node 8.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9: Skipped pair because there are no nodes greater than 9 to form a triangle.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
