Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, we'll determine the number of triangles in the given graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1.
            * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 3.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8 and Node 9:
            * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

        Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are: <4, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <7, 9, 2>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>.

        The final answer is [6].
