Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as described in the previous example, we can calculate the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) - Triangle formed with edge (1, 5).
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - Triangle formed with edge (1, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed with edge (5, 6).
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * No triangles for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Number of triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No triangles for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * Number of triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Number of triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No additional triangles for Node 9.
  
Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
