Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs as they involve nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[<0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>]
