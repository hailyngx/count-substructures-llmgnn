Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or greater as they are larger than 0. No triangles formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 3:
    * No triangles formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 7:
    * No triangles formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
