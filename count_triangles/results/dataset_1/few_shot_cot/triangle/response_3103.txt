Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the method explained in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    Skip because there are not enough nodes to form a triangle with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) - 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.

* Node 7:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 7.

* Node 8:
    Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) - 0 and 1 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 0 and 1 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 2) - 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 6) - 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 1 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) - 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) - 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 4

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
