Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example for each node:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 1:
            * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 2:
            * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 3:
            * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 4:
            * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 5:
            * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 6:
            * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 7:
            * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 5 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 8:
            * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> 9 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 9 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        * Node 9:
            * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Both 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but 2 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 10.
        
        Therefore, there are 10 triangles in the given graph.

        The unique triangles found are <5, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 4>, <3, 7, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 1, 8>, <9, 2, 4>.

        The final answer is [10].
