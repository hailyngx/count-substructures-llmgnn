Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 3 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 8: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 9: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 10: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 6 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed as 2 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not connected.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed as 5, 7, and 2 are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of these nodes to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
