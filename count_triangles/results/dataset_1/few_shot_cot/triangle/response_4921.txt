Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> Triangle found: <0, 2, 9>
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> Triangle found: <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Triangle found: <0, 4, 8>
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> Triangle found: <3, 5, 8>
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> Triangle found: <3, 6, 9>
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> Triangle found: <4, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Skipped as they are greater than the previous nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
