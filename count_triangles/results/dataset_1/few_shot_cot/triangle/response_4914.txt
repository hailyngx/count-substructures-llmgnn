Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example:

* Node 0:
    No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    No triangles can be formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    No triangles can be formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 4.

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed as all pairs involve nodes smaller than 5.

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9:
    No triangles can be formed as each of these nodes has fewer than 2 neighbors greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are 0 triangles in the given graph.
