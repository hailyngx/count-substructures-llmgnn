Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
