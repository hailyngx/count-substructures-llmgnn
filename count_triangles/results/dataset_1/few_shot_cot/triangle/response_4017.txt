Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected directly as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are connected directly as (6, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
