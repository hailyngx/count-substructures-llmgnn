Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, here is the count of triangles for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0) than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0 and Node 1) than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2) than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3) than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5) than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed as there are no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6) than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8) than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
