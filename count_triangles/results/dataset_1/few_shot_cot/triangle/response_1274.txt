Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as (2, 4) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 0 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 1 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 0 and 3 are also connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 2 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node as all its possible pairs are with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (0, 5) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 4 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 5 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are also connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * No more pairs involving Node 6 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs involving Node 7 available to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node as all its possible pairs are with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node as all its possible pairs are with smaller nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
