Response:
Let's start counting the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> Nodes 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> Nodes 1 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> Nodes 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 7) -> Nodes 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> Nodes 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> Nodes 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> Nodes 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Nodes 6 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are all smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
