Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0: No neighbors, no triangles possible.

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (5, 6) - 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed <1, 5, 6>.
  * Pair 2: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed <1, 5, 7>.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pair that includes Node 1, as it is smaller than Node 2.
  * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
  * No neighbors, no triangles possible.

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
  * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) - 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected. Triangle formed <5, 6, 7>.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
  * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
  * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 8.
  * No triangles possible with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
  * No triangles possible with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph. 

So the answer is [3].
