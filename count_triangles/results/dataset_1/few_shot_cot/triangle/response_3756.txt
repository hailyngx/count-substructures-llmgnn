Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count triangles in the graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No possible triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    - No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

- Nodes 8 and 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
