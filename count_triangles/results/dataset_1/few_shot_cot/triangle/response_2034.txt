Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 6 are also connected as (3, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 8, 9, 2, 5, 7:
    * Since these nodes do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them, they are skipped to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 6) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
