Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (5, 7) ->
  * Pair 2: (5, 9) ->
  * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1 and Node 6:
  * Skipped because Node 1 has only one neighbor, and Node 6 has no neighbors to form triangles with.

* Node 2:
  * Skipped any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller.
  * Pair 1: (1, 8) ->
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Triangle formed: <3, 7, 8>
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller.
  * Pair 1: (7, 9) ->
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> Triangle formed: <7, 8, 9>
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
  * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
