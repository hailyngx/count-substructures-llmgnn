Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step by step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 1 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs involving Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangles for Node 4 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected via an edge.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5 to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least two nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
