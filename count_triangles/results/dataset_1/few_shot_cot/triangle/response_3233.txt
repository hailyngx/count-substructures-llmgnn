Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges.

Response:
Following the example provided, here is the step-by-step calculation for finding the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Prune pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 1 and 2.
        * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 1:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 2 and 3.
        * Pair 1: (3, 6) - Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 7) - Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 0 and 1.
        * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Both 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (3, 8) - Both 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 9) - Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 4: (5, 8) - Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (5, 9) - Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) - Both 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
        * Pair 1: (7, 9) - Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 5:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 2, 3, and 4.
        * No other nodes left to form triangles.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Proceeding with Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

    * Node 6:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip pairs with smaller nodes: Skip pairs with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Nodes 8 and 9:
        * Skipped as there are no pairs that can form triangles with them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [2].
