Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are directly connected as (3, 6) in the edge list. But node 6 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are directly connected as (4, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are directly connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. But node 4 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. But node 8 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 11: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are directly connected as (5, 8) in the edge list. But node 8 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 12: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected as (5, 9) in the edge list. But node 9 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 1. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are not directly connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, and, 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are directly connected as (6, 4) in the edge list. But node 4 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 3. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) -> 8 and 5 are directly connected as (8, 5) in the edge list. But node 8 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 1, 8, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected as (6, 8) in the edge list. But node 8 is not 1-hop neighbor of node 5. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Now, continuing this process for Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (1, 9), but since 1 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
