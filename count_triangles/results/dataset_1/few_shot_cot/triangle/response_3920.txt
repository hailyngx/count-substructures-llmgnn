Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No edge between 1 and 5. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No edge between 1 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> No edge between 5 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No edge between 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> No edge between 5 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 8) -> No edge between 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No edge between 4 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> No edge between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 2) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> No edge between 6 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> No edge between 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 6), but since 4 and 6 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No edge between 5 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than themselves to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
