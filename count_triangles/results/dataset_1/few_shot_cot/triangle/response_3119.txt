Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 7, 8}

Response:
Let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by following the same step-by-step process as before for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 7, 8, or 9 as they are greater than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skipped as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 8 or 9 as they are greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 9 as it is greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skipped as it has no neighbors to form triangles with.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
