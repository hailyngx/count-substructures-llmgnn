Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will determine the number of triangles in the graph given:

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) - 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) - 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) - 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 6 and 8 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Hence, the answer is [3].
