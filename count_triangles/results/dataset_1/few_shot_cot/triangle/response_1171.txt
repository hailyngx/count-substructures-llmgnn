Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* For the remaining nodes: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we can see that there won't be any triangles with them as the smallest numbered node since there are no pairs of nodes with higher numbers that are both connected to a specific node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
