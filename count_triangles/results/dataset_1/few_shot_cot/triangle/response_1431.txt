Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Form a triangle with Node 5 and Node 2: <0, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Node 1 has no connections, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it's smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Node 3 has only 1-hop neighbor 8, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Form a triangle with Node 6 and Node 7: <5, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed from these nodes individually.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <5, 6, 7>.
