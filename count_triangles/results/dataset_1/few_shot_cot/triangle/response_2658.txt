Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Pair 4: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected, so no triangle is formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are directly connected, forming a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Therefore, the triangles found in the given graph are <0, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 6>, <6, 0, 2>, <7, 3, 8>. 

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
