Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 6 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1 and 8 is a 1-hop neighbor of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 5) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
