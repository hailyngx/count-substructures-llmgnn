Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
