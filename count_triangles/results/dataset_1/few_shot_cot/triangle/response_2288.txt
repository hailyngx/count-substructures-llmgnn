Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Since Node 1 has no neighbors, there are no triangles involving Node 1.

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (3, 6). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (7, 8). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (0, 9) -> Both 0 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Both 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    - No other pairs to form triangles involving Node 7.

- Node 8:
    - Since Node 8 has no neighbors, there are no triangles involving Node 8.

- Node 9:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    - Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Both 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (0, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
