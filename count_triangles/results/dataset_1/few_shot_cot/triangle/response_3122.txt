Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 4>
        * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 1, 6>
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 1:
        * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 2, 6>
        * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 2:
        * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
        * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 3:
        * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> Triangle formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 2, 3>
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 4:
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 7>
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 6:
        * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 6, 7>
        * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 6, 7>
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

    * Node 7:
        * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

    * Node 8 & Node 9:
        * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 or Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
