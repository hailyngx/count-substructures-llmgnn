Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same approach as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2 but are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 3.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5 and are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 4) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
