Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) - Triangle with Node 0, 3, 5 formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) - Triangle with Node 0, 4, 6 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * The only pair we could consider is (6, 7), but since 6 and 7 are both greater than 1, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skipped as no pair exists with nodes greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle with Node 4, 5, 8 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - Triangle with Node 0, 5, 6 formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) - Triangle with Node 4, 5, 8 formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 0), but since 9 and 0 are greater than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 7, 8, or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
