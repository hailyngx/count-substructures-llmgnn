Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, we will now find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 4: Skipped as it has no neighbors.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
