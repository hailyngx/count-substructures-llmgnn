Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> Nodes 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (3, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Nodes 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs including Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 3.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs including Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs including Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than Node 8.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are directly connected as (8, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to form a triangle involving Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
