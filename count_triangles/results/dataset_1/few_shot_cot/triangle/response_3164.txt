Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
*Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (5, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) -> 5 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

*Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (0, 3) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (0, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

*Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

*Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
*Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Nodes 2-9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
