Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the same approach as shown in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
