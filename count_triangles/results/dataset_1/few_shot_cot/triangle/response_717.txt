Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 since they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are connected, but 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 9: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected, but 5 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 since they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 2 and 4 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 since they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are: 
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 4>

The final answer is [5].
