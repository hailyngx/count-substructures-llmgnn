Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 8 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes that are smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
