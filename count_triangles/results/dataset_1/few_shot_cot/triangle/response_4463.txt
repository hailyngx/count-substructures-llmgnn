Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 5 as they are greater than 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 or 4 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip the pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No neighbors, so no triangle can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip the pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 or 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair with Node 4 as it is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip the pair with Node 9 as Node 9 is smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
[1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <1, 9, 8>.
