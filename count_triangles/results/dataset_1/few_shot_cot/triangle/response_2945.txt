Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8)

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as (5, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 1 since they have already been considered.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 2 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 3 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 4 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 5 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 6 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 7 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 8 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving nodes smaller than 9 since they have already been considered.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
