Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, we will now calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) - No triangle formed as 2 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) - No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) - 3 and 8 are connected directly as (3, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can form triangles with smaller nodes.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 6) - No triangle formed as 0 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) - No triangle formed as 8 and 6 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (8, 4) - 8 and 4 are connected directly as (8, 4) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (5, 0) - No triangle formed as 5 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (5, 4) - No triangle formed as 5 and 4 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 3: (5, 0) - No triangle formed as 5 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0) - No triangle formed as 4 and 0 are not connected directly.
    * Pair 2: (4, 5) - No triangle formed as 4 and 5 are not connected directly.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8 as they are smaller.
    * No triangles can be formed with remaining nodes.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - No triangle formed as 3 and 7 are not connected directly.
    * No triangles can be formed with other pairs involving 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs can form triangles with smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:

* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
