Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
[5]

Explanation:
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> 0 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 0 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 2

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph, and they are <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, and <5, 8, 9>. Hence, the final answer is [5].
