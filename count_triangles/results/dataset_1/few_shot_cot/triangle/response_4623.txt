Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the example provided, we'll calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 1:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No other pairs possible with 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - No Triangle formed with 2 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 3. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - No other pairs possible with 4 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    - No other pairs possible with 5 as the smallest numbered node.

- Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected in the edge list and are 1-hop neighbors of 6. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 7, 8, and 9:
    - Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them to form triangles.

Therefore, calculating the total triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
