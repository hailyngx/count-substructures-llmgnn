Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the instructions given in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are connected as (5, 9). No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 8 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are connected as (6, 9). No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (0, 1) -> 0 and 1 are connected as (0, 1). No additional nodes to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
