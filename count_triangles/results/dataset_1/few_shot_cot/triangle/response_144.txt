Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles can be formed.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 5

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form a triangle greater than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to form a triangle greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form a triangle greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 8.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No edges connected to Node 9, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 5 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
