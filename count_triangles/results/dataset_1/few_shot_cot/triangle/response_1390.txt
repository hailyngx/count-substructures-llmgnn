Response:
Following the process shown in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

    * Node 0:
        * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 5: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
        * Pair 7: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 1:

        * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 3.
        * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 4:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
        * Skip (4, 5), it will be computed when Node 5 is processed.
        * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 4 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 5:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
        * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 3

    * Node 6:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
        * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

    * Node 7:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
        * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (7, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
        * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 8:
        * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 8.
        * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
        * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

    * Node 9:
        * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 9.
        * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
