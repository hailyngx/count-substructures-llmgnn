Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the same method used in the example before, let's find the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 1) -> 4 and 1 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No more triangles can be formed involving Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed involving Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Only one pair with a node smaller than 6, which is (4, 3). Thus, this pair is skipped.

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No more triangles can be formed involving Node 7.

* Node 8, 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with only 1-hop neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
