Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach as in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0: No triangles can be formed as there are no neighbors.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 1 and 4 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 5: No triangles can be formed as there are no neighbors.

* Node 6: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 7: No triangles can be formed as there are not enough neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
