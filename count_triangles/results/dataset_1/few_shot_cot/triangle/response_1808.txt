Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 2 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also directly connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Both 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge between them in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Skip the pairs (7, 9) and (8, 3) as they are not directly connected. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Skip the pair (7, 9) as they are not directly connected. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip the pair (1, 8) as 1 is smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Only one neighbor, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 4 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 3 as it is smaller than 8.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
