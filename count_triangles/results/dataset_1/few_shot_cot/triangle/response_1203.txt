Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as there is no edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1 as there is no edge connecting them. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs to consider. No triangles formed.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 4 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs to consider. No triangles formed.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not connected in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs to consider. No triangles formed.

* Node 9:
    * No 1-hop neighbor pairs to consider. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
