Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - Formed a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) - Formed a triangle with Node 1.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) - Formed a triangle with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Formed a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Formed a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Formed a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Formed a triangle with Node 6.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - Formed a triangle with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller.
    * Pair 1: (8, 5) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because they have no pairs greater than them.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
