Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected because (5, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are not connected because (2, 3) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are connected and 2 and 4 are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are connected and 2 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not connected because (3, 4) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected because (3, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected and 4 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 1. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are not connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are connected and 4 and 8 are also 1-hop neighbors of 2. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not connected because (7, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 8 and 9 are not connected as there is no edge (8, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
