Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 7}

Response:
Following the instructions from the example provided earlier, let's determine the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with the previous nodes as they are smaller than Node 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with the previous nodes as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with the previous nodes as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with the previous nodes as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with the previous nodes as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than both 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
