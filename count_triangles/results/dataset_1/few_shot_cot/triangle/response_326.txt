Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5)

1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of 1. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node. No triangles formed.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 4) -> 7 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node. No triangles formed.

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. No triangles formed.

* Nodes 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. No triangles formed.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
