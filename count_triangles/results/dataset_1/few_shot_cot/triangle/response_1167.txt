Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the provided example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 1:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 1 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 5: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 4 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    - Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 7 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    - Skip all pairs as there are no nodes greater than 9 to form triangles with.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the given graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the provided graph.
