Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3}

Response:
Following the process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> Both 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 7 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with larger nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) = 2

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
