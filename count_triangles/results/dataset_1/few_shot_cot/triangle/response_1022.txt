Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 5 as they are smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 2 and 6 are not directly connected as there is no edge (2, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (8, 6) -> Both 8 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 8 and 6 are directly connected as (8, 0), (0, 6) shown in the edge list. Triangle formed: <1, 8, 0>.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> Both 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (5, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 as it is smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no nodes greater than 5 to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 7 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 1) 
* Final Answer: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph, which is <1, 8, 0>.
