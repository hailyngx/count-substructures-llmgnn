Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's identify the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest node.

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> Both 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3. They are also connected as (2, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> Both 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6. They are also connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
