Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the same process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> Skipped as 2 is smaller than 3.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> Skipped as 2 is smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * No triangles possible with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <3, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles possible with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles possible with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 2 as it is smaller than 6.
    * No triangles possible with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 1 as it is smaller than 7.
    * No triangles possible with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed: <9, 4, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
