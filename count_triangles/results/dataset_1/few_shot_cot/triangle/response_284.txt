Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 4) and (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list, but they are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 6) and (3, 7). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 6) and (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (3, 7) and (3, 9). Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
