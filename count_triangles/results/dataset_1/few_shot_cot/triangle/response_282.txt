Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as described in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> Nodes 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> Nodes 3 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> Nodes 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 8) -> Nodes 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> Nodes 5 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> Nodes 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9) in the edge list and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Nodes 4 and 5 are connected as (4, 7, 5) in the edge list and both are 1-hop neighbors of Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node. 
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
