Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same method as described in the example with the provided information:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 3, 4, and 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipping these nodes as there isn't another node greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
