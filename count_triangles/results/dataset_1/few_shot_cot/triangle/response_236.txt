Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
  * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
  * The only pair we could consider is (3, 3), but since they are the same node, this pair is skipped.
  * No other nodes left to form triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
  * No neighbors to form any triangles.
  * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
  * No new triangles can be formed using node 8 as the smallest, as all other nodes have been covered.
  * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with only one neighbor.
  * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
