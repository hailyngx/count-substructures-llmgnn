Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not 1-hop neighbors of 6 because there is no direct edge between them. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
