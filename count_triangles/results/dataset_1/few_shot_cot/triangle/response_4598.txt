Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process provided in the example, let's count the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 5 are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pair to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (3, 0) -> 3 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as (3, 0) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (6, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pair to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No pairs to consider.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
