Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example with the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) - Not applicable as 0 is connected to 4, and 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Pair 2: (0, 3) - Not applicable as 0 is connected to 4, and 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Pair 3: (0, 7) - Not applicable as 0 is connected to 4, and 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) - Not applicable as 1 is connected to 3 and 8, and 2 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
    * Pair 2: (1, 9) - Not applicable as 1 is connected to 3 and 8, and 9 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) - Not applicable as 2 is connected to 4, 8, and 9, and 3 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 2.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) - Not applicable as 2 is connected to 4, 8, and 9, and 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) - Not applicable as 3 is connected to 1 and 4, and 7 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) - Not applicable as 4 is connected to 0, 2, 3, and 7, and 8 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 4.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - Not applicable as 4 is connected to 0, 2, 3, and 7, and 9 is not a 1-hop neighbor of 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7: No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - Both 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No new triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
