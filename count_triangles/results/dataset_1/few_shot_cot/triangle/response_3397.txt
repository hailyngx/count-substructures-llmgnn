Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step approach to count triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than Node 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 4 as they are smaller than Node 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with Node 1 as it is smaller than Node 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 7) -> 8 and 7 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair with Node 6 as it is smaller than Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 = 3

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
