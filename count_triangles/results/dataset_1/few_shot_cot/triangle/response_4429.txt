Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 4}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the graph step-by-step applied to each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 9) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors, so no triangles with Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Both 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> Both 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (4, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Both 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles: 
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
