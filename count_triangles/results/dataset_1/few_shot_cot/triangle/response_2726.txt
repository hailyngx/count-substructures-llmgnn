Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1 

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
