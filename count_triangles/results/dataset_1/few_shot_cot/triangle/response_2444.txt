Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the method demonstrated in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 since they are smaller than Node 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Both 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Both 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 7 as they are smaller than Node 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, or 9 as they are smaller than Node 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0. 

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
