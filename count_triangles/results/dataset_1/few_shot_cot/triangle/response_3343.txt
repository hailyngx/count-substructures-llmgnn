Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the example provided earlier, let's count the number of triangles in this graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not connected because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices. 

* Node 3:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices.

* Node 4:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices.

* Node 5:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices.

* Node 6:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as one of the vertices because its only neighbor node has a higher index.

* Node 7:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as one of the vertices because its only neighbor node has a higher index.

* Node 8:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices.

* Node 9:
    - No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as one of the vertices because all its neighbor nodes have higher indices.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
