Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but aren't directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 but aren't directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs involving Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 3, hence no triangles involving Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0


* Node 6:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 6, hence no triangles involving Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7 but not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No 1-hop neighbors for Node 8, hence no triangles involving Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip all pairs involving Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 9 and are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
