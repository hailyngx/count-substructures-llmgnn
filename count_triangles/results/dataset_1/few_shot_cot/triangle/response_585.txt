Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 8}

Response:
To find the number of triangles in the graph and list the unique triangles, we'll follow the same step-by-step process as demonstrated in the initial explanation. Let's go through each node to count the triangles:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No edges connected to Node 5, so no triangles can be formed with it.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (7, 6), but since 6 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Both nodes have only 1-hop neighbors smaller than themselves, so no triangles can be formed with them.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 and Node 9 as the smallest numbered nodes: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
