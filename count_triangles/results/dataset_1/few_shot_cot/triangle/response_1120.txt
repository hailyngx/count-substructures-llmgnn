Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 4) -> 4 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, forming a loop. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as (4, 6) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 7 are also directly connected as (6, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to form a triangle.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair with Node 4 as it is smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are also connected as (7, 9) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 9) -> 9 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, forming a loop. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 8 and 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) = 7

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.
