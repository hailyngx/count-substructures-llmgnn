Response:
Following the step-by-step process as shown in the example for each node in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as (1, 4) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 5 are also connected as (1, 5) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as (1, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 8 are also connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 8 are also connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * No other pairs available to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 5 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 8 are also directly connected as (3, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 5 and 7 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 8 are also directly connected as (5, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also directly connected as (4, 7) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also directly connected as (4, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 8 are also directly connected as (7, 8) shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * Following the same process, we can find:
        * Node 4: 3 triangles
        * Node 5: 0 triangles
        * Node 6: 0 triangles
        * Node 7: 3 triangles
        * Node 8: 0 triangles
        * Node 9: 0 triangles

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 3 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 12.

Therefore, there are [12] triangles in the given graph.
  
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 8>.
