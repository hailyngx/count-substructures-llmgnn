Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 5}

Response:
Following the same procedure as in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <0, 2, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 6) -> Forms a triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: <1, 3, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: <4, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> Forms a triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 8, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
