Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 8}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's count the triangles in the graph:

        * Node 0:
            * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 2: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are connected, but they are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
            * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 8: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Pair 10: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 1:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 2:
            * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 3:
            * Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
            * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> No triangle formed.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 4:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 5:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
            * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> No triangle formed.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 6:
            * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 7:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 7.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 8:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        * Node 9:
            * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
            * No other pairs to consider for forming triangles.
            * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

        Summarizing the triangles:
        * Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

        Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
