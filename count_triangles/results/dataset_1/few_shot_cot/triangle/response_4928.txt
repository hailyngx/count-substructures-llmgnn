Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example given earlier:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 (1) and Node 3 (3).
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 (1) and Node 8 (8).
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 1 (1) and Node 9 (9).
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed with Node 2 (2) and Node 4 (4).
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> There are no triangles formed with this pair.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> There are no triangles formed with this pair.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 (4) and Node 7 (7).
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 4 (4) and Node 7 (7).
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * There are no triangles formed with the remaining pairs.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * There are no triangles that can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * There are no triangles that can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * There are no triangles that can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren’t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
