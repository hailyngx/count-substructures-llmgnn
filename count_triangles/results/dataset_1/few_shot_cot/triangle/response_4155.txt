Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example for the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 5 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 5 and 8 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 7 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 5 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangle as no pair of 1-hop neighbors are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and 7 and 9 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangle as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No possible triangle as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No possible triangle as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
