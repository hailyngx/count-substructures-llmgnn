Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> Triangle formed with Node 8.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed with Node 5.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Triangle formed with Node 7.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> Triangle formed with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * No pairs to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 4 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
