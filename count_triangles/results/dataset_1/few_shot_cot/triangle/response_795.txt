Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the previous example, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they're connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they're connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pair with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't enough nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <0, 1, 8>.

Hence, the final answer is [2].
