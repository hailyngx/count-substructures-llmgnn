Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (1, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, and 7:
    * Skipped as they don't have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have enough nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are no triangles in the given graph.
