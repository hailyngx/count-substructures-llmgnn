Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Triangle formed as 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> Triangle formed as 2 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Pair 3: (4, 5) -> Triangle formed as 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0 and are connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3
    * List of triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> Triangle formed as 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 and are connected.
    * Pair 2: (5, 7) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> No triangle formed as 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2 but not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1
    * List of triangles: <0, 2, 5>

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip as no pairs exist with nodes greater than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip as no pairs exist with nodes greater than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles found:
[<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>]
