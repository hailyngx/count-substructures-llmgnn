Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 6}

Response:
Following the same process as shown in the example, here is how you can find the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. **Node 0:**
    - Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected as (1, 4). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. **Node 1:**
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (2, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

3. **Node 2:**
    - Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 2: (5, 2) -> 5 and 2 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (2, 5). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 7). Triangle formed.
    - Pair 4: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (6, 9). Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

4. **Node 3:**
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

5. **Node 4:**
    - Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. **Node 5:**
    - Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

7. **Node 6:**
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

8. **Node 7:**
    - Skip all pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

9. **Nodes 8 and 9:**
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 3 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
