Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (0, 5) -> 0 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * The only pair we could consider is (4, 7), but since 4 and 7 are both smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of each other, and they are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 7), but since 7 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are [4] triangles in the given graph.
