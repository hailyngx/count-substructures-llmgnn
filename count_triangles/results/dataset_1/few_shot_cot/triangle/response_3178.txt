Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example above, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip because there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip because there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 6>
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 8>
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 9>
    * Pair 4: (6, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (8, 9) - No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip because there are no 1-hop neighbors to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip because 0, 1, and 3 are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip because 3 is smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip because there are no other nodes to form a triangle with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip because 0 and 3 are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip because 3 and 7 are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>.
