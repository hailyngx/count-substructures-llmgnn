Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
   - Pair 3: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 1 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 6: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 4 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

2. Node 1:
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 2: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 3 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected. Triangle formed.
   - Pair 5: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

3. Node 2:
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

4. Node 3:
   - Only one pair to consider: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.

5. Node 4:
   - Skip pairs with smaller nodes.
   - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 7 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
   - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

6. Node 5:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
   - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8 and Node 9: Skipped as they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles:
Total triangles = 1 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
