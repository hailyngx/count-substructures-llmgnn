Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the method explained in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Since Node 3 has no 1-hop neighbors other than Node 0, there are no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs including Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 4. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Node 5 has no 1-hop neighbors, so no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Since Node 7 only has 1-hop neighbors with Node 8, there are no triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9 as there are none left.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
