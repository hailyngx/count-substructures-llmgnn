Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 6) in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (4, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as (6, 8) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it only has 1 neighbor.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as it shares no common neighbors with at least two other nodes.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as it only has 2 neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any triangles with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected as (6, 7) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as it only has 2 neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as (7, 8) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as it shares no common neighbors with at least two other nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as it shares no common neighbors with at least two other nodes.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as it only has 4 neighbors. 

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 4 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 6) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
