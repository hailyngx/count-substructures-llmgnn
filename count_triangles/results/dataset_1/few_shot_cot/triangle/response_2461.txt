Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process detailed in the example provided, we calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> Both 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 5 and 6 are directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No possible triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2 and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No pairs can be formed with nodes greater than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 and 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
