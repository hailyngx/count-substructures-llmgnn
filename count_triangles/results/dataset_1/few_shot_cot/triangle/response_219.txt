Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (2, 8) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with only one 1-hop neighbor.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected. Triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    - Skip further analysis as there are no pairs left to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer inside brackets is: [4].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 6>.
