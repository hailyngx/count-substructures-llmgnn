Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 6 and 9 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 8 are not directly connected, so no triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Both 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 4 and 7 are directly connected, so one triangle formed: <2, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> Both 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 7 are directly connected, so one triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> Both 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 7 and 9 are directly connected, so one triangle formed: <6, 7, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 0) -> Both 9 and 0 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 9 and 0 are directly connected, so one triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Final Answer: 
[<2, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 9, 0>]

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
