Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 6 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider, no triangles formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No pairs to consider, no triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider, no triangles formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider, no triangles formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 7) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.  

[<2, 7, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 9>]
