Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to form triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
    * No possible triangles with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is only 1 triangle in the given graph.
