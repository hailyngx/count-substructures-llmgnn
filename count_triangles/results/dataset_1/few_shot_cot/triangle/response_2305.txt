Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Nodes with smaller numbers than 2. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes a Node with a smaller number than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped since there aren't at least 2 nodes with numbers greater than 8 and 9.

Summarizing the triangles found:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [4].
