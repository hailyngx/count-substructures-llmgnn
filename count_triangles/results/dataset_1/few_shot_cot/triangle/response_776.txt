Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) - No edge between 4 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) - No edge between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) - No edge between 6 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1, 3, 5, and 9:
    * Skipped because they do not have at least 2 nodes greater than them.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) - Both 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) - Both 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) - Both 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 0 and 2 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) - No edge between 7 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 2 and 4 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) - No edge between 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) - No edge between 5 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
