Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. 
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2
    * Unique triangles: <1, 4, 9> <1, 5, 9>

* Node 2:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangle can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
[<1, 4, 9> <1, 5, 9>]

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
