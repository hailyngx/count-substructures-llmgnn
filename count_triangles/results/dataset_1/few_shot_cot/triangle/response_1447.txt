Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the previous example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) - No triangle formed, as 1 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 2: (1, 5) - No triangle formed, as 1 and 5 are not connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 4) - No triangle formed, as 2 and 4 are not connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 5) - No triangle formed, as 2 and 5 are not connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skipped, as there are no possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skipped, as there are no possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, and 8 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) - Both 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 6 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 5, and 8 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4 and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangles to form with one-hop neighbors.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1] and the unique triangle found is <4, 6, 9>.
