Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the method explained above, let's determine the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    - No other pairs found based on the given edges and adjacency list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - No pairs found involving Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - No pairs found involving Node 4.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    - Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - No pairs found involving Nodes 6, 7, 8, or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
