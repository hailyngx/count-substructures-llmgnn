Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 1 (Node 0).
    * No triangles formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 2 (Node 0 and 1).
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 3 (Node 0, 1, and 2).
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 7: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 8: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 10: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 4 (Node 0, 1, 2, and 3).
    * No triangles formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 5 (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4).
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are also directly connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 6 (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).
    * No triangles formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7 (Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).
    * No triangles formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are 7 triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
