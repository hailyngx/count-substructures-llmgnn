Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are not connected because (1, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Pair 3: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (3, 6) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    - Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (8, 3) -> 8 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 6.
    - Pair 1: (9, 0) -> 9 and 0 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 0 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 9 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    - No other nodes left to form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    - Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
