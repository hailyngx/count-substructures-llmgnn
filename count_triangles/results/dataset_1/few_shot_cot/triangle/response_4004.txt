Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's count the triangles in the given graph step-by-step:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 7 are also connected according to the edge list.
    - Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    - Pair 1: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4, 5, 8:
    - Skipped as they have no connections to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    - Skipped as the only neighbor is smaller than Node 6.

* Node 7:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1.
    - Pair 1: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    - Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    - Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 7, as they are smaller than Node 9.
    - Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [3].
