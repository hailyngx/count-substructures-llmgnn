Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 7}

Response:
Following the steps mentioned in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 0, 4, and 5. <0, 4, 5>
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Forms a triangle. <0, 4, 9>
    * Pair 3: (5, 9) -> Forms a triangle with 0, 5, and 9. <0, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 1, 2, and 5. <1, 2, 5>
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 1, 5, and 7. <1, 5, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> Forms a triangle with 1, 2, and 8. <1, 2, 8>
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> Forms a triangle with 3, 4, and 7. <3, 4, 7>
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Forms a triangle. <4, 6, 7>
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No other nodes left to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 5) -> Forms a triangle with 7, 5, and 9. <7, 5, 9>
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 triangles in the given graph.
