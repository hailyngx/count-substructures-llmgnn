Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {4, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined for each node like in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    No edges connected to Node 0, so no triangles formed.
    Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 1.
    Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 2.
    Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 4.
    Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are directly connected, forming a triangle with Node 6.
    Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    No additional triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    No edges connected to Node 9, so no triangles formed.
    Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
