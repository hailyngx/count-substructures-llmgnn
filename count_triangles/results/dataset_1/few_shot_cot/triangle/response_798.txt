Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 1 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 2 as there are no other nodes greater than 2.

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 3 as there are no other nodes greater than 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 2 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 6 as there are no other nodes greater than 6.

* Node 7: 
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No more pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for Node 9 as there are no other nodes greater than 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 8) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
