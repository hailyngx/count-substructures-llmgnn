Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5}

Response:
Following the same method as the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 5) -> 5 is a 1-hop neighbor of 0, and 5 is connected to itself as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0, as it is smaller than 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0 and 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (7, 6) -> 7 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 7 and 6 are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as they are smaller than 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as they are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, as they are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that include Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (Node 3) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
