Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2}

Response:
Following the example provided, we will count the number of triangles in the given graph step-by-step for each node:

- Node 0:
  - Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 2: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 3: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 4: (1, 9) -> 1 and 9 are connected as (1, 9), forming a triangle with Node 0.
  - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 1

- Node 1:
  - Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 2: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 3: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest node: 0

- Node 2:
  - Skip any pair that includes Nodes 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
  - Pair 1: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected, so no triangle.
  - Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are connected as (8, 9), forming a triangle with Node 2.
  - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest node: 1

- Node 3:
  - The only pair we could consider is (6, 4), but since 4 is smaller than 6, this pair is skipped.
  - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 0

- Node 4:
  - Skip any pair with Nodes 0 and 3, as they are smaller than 4.
  - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest node: 0

- Node 5:
  - No other nodes to form triangles with.
  - Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest node: 0

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9:
  - Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than each of them.

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
