Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the format shown in the example earlier, let's determine the triangles in the graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 3) -> 7 and 3 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 4) in the edge list. 
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (3, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (3, 8) is not in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as (4, 5) in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other as (5, 8) is not in the adjacency list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as (5, 9) in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7:
    * Similarly, no triangles can be formed with these nodes as there are no pairs of nodes greater than them.

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 1 and 5 as they are greater nodes.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 as they are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
