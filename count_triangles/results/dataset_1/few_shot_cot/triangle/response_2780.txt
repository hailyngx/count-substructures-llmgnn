Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> 1 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 1, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 4) -> 0 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected. Triangle formed <0, 3, 4>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed using Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
