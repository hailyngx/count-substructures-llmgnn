Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 5 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but 3 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 1.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, but 4 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with nodes smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0)
[3] 

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
