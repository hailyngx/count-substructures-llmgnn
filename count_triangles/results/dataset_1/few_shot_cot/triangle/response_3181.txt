Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (0, 7) -> 0 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 5, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
