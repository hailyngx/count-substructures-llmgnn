Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Node 1 as it's larger.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 3 are also connected.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 3: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 4: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 5: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 7: (3, 7) -> 3 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 8: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected.
    * Pair 9: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 9 are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Node 1 as it's larger.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 1 or 2 as they are larger.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs as all other nodes are larger than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, but they are not directly connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip the pair (9, 1) since 1 is smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No other nodes to form triangles with.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs that involve Nodes 1, 2, or 3 as they are all larger.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are [2] triangles in the given graph.
