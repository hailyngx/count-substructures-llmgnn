Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step approach outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip Pair 1: (0, 3) as 0 and 3 are smaller nodes.
    * Skip Pair 2: (0, 8) as 0 and 8 are smaller nodes.
    * Pair 3: (0, 9) -> 0 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 7) -> 9 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs as the other nodes are smaller than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
[<6, 9, 7>, <2, 6, 9>]
