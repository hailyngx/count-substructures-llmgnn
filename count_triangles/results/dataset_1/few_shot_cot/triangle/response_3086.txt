Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 2, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 3) -> 4 and 3 are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: <3, 4, 2>.

* Node 4:
    * Skip Node 3 as it is smaller than 4.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 4.

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 5) -> 7 and 5 are connected. This forms a triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: <5, 6, 1>.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 7.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes smaller than 9.
    * No other pairs to consider for Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.

[<3, 4, 2>, <5, 6, 1>]
