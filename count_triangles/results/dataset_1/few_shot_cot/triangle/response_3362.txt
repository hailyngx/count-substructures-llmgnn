Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 2: (3, 4) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 8.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 4.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> Node 3 and Node 4 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (0, 8) -> Form a triangle with Node 8.
        <0, 2, 4>
    * No more pairs left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 7.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No valid pairs to form triangles with Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
