Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are not connected because (2, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 4: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (4, 7) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 6: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other because (7, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 4 are not directly connected as there is no edge (3, 4) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not connected because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1 or 2 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but 9 and 8 are not directly connected as there is no edge (9, 8) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6:
    * Skipped because there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 5 or 6.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (9, 8), but since both nodes are smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 5 as it is smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and 5 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

[<1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <5, 8, 9>]
