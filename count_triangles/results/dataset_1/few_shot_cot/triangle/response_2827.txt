Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 2, 5}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, we will find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * No triangles can be formed as Node 0 has no 1-hop neighbors.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but 6 and 7 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * No triangles can be formed for Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed for Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * No triangles can be formed for Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed for Node 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed for Node 9.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 triangles in the given graph.
