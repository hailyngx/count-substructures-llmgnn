Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 4}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example provided, we will calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
  * Pair 1: (1, 4) -> Triangle <0, 1, 4>.
  * Pair 2: (1, 9) -> Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
  * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
  * Pair 1: (2, 9) -> Triangle <1, 2, 9>.
  * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
  * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle <2, 3, 4>.
  * Pair 2: (6, 7) -> Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
  * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
  * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> Triangle <3, 4, 9>.
  * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
  * No pairs to form triangles involving Node 4.

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
  * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
