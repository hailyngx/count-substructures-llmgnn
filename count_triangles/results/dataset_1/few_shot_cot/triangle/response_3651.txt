Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 5, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {5, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process shown in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2)
    * Pair 2: (1, 3)
    * Pair 3: (1, 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 6)
    * Pair 2: (6, 7)
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (3, 0)
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 0)
    * Pair 2: (4, 1)
    * Pair 3: (4, 2)
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7)
    * Pair 2: (5, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9)
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1)
    * Pair 2: (7, 4)
    * Pair 3: (7, 6)
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8)
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider as there are no nodes greater than 8.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
