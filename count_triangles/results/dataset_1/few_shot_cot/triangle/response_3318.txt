Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 2, 4, 8}

Response:
Following the steps outlined in the example provided, let's proceed to find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not connected directly. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 1.

* Node 2:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected directly (6, 9). Possible triangle formed with Node 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected directly (6, 9). Possible triangle formed with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 5.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected directly (5, 7). Possible triangle formed with Node 6.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider. No triangles can be formed starting from Node 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
