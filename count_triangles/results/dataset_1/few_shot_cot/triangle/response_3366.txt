Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Response:
Following the example provided, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph by examining each node:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> {3, 5, 0} Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 9) -> {3, 9, 0} Triangle formed.
    * No additional pairs left to form triangles with Node 0.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> {4, 7, 1} Triangle formed.
    * No additional pairs left to form triangles with Node 1.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip this node as there are no pairs to form triangles.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 7) -> {5, 7, 3} Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 9) -> {5, 9, 3} Triangle formed.
    * No additional pairs left to form triangles with Node 3.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> {6, 7, 4} Triangle formed.
    * No additional pairs left to form triangles with Node 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Pair 1: (8, 6) -> {8, 6, 5} Triangle formed.
    * No additional pairs left to form triangles with Node 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * Skip this node as there are no pairs to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * No pairs left to form triangles with Node 7.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
