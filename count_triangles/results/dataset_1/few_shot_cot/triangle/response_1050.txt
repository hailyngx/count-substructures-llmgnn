Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 6, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as the example provided:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are not 1-hop neighbors of node 0. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No edge between 4 and 6. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No edge between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 1. No edge between 6 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 2. No edge between 4 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of node 3. No edge between 4 and 7. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 4. No edge between 6 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of node 6. No edge between 8 and 9. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (9, 8) -> 9 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of node 7. No edge between 9 and 8. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph: 0

Therefore, there are [0] triangles in the given graph.
