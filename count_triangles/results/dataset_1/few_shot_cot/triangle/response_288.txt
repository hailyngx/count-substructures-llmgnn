Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 2, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 6) -> 1 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (1, 6) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected as there is no edge (6, 7) in the list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
