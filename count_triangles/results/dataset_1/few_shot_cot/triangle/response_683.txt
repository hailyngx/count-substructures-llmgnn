Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 7}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 6 and 8 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No possible triangle with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No possible triangle with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest node: 2

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * No possible triangle with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No possible triangle with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * No possible triangle with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * The only pair to consider is (3, 9), but since 3 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * No possible triangle with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No possible triangle with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * The only pair to consider is (4, 7), but since 4 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * No possible triangle with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 3) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
