Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <2, 3, 6> forms a triangle as all three nodes are connected.

2. Node 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

3. Node 2:
    - <0, 1, 7> forms a triangle as all three nodes are connected.

4. Node 3:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

5. Node 4:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

6. Node 5:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

7. Node 6:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

8. Node 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

9. Node 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

10. Node 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles: 
Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 2) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
