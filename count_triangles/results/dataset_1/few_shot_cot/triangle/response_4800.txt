Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example above to count the triangles in the given graph: 

* Node 0:
    * No possible triangles as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 1:
    * No possible triangles as there is no edge between its neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No possible triangles due to lack of edges between neighbors.

* Node 4:
    * No possible triangles as there is only one neighbor.

* Node 5:
    * No possible triangles due to lack of edges between its neighbors.

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6.
    * Pair 1: (9, 2) -> 9 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (9, 5) -> 9 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 7:
    * No neighbors, so no possible triangles.

* Node 8:
    * No neighbors, so no possible triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 2, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No possible triangles due to a lack of direct connection between its neighbors.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
