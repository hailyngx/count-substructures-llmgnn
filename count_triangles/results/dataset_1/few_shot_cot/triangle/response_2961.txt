Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 to 6 as they are smaller than 7. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 to 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, and they are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 9:
    * Skip pairs with Nodes 0 to 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.

Let's find the unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
