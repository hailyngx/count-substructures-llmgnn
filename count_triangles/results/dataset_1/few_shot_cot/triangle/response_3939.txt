Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 2, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {2, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 3, 4, 6}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example, let's calculate the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as it has no 1-hop neighbors.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 2, or 4 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as all possible combinations are covered from other nodes having smaller labels.

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 5 or 6 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 7 as there are no suitable pairs.

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skipped because there arenâ€™t at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 3 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 1 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
