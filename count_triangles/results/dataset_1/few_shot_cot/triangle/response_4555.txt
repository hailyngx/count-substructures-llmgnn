Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 5, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {2, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 3, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process outlined in the example provided, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Skip all pairs with smaller nodes.
    * No triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * No neighbors for Node 1 to form triangles with.

* Node 2:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 5 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but 3 and 6 are not connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and 3 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs for Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No more pairs for Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No neighbors for Node 4 to form triangles with.

* Node 5:
    * No neighbors for Node 5 to form triangles with.

* Node 6:
    * No neighbors for Node 6 to form triangles with.

* Node 7:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 7. No triangle formed.
    * No more pairs for Node 7.

* Node 8:
    * Skip all pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No more pairs for Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No neighbors for Node 9 to form triangles with.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.
