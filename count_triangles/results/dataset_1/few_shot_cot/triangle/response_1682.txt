Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {7, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {1, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 5, 6, 8}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 8 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 8 and 9 are both smaller than 3, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 5 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * No other triangles can be formed with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with smaller numbered nodes.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * The only pair we could consider is (8, 9), but since 9 is smaller than 8, this pair is skipped.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) 
Therefore, there is 1 triangle in the given graph.
