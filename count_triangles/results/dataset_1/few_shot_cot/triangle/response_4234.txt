Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 2, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {6}

Response:
Following the same process as demonstrated in the example provided:

* Node 0:
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 6.
    - Pair 2: (4, 7) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 8.
    - Pair 4: (6, 7) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 7 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 6: (7, 8) -> No triangle formed as 7 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    - No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    - Pair 1: (3, 4) -> Triangle formed with 3 and 4.
    - Pair 2: (3, 6) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 6 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 3: (3, 8) -> No triangle formed as 3 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 4: (4, 6) -> No triangle formed as 4 and 6 are not directly connected.
    - Pair 5: (4, 8) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 8.
    - Pair 6: (6, 8) -> No triangle formed as 6 and 8 are not directly connected.
    - Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    - Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Triangle formed with 4 and 6.
    - No other pairs can form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    - Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    - Pair 1: (6, 7) -> Triangle formed with 6 and 7.
    - No other pairs can form triangles.
    - Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with these nodes as the smallest numbered node.

Summing up the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
