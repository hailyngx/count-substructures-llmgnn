Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {1, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {3, 5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {}

Response:
Following the same approach as in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * No other pairs with 1 as the smallest numbered node. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * No other pairs with 2 as the smallest numbered node. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (8, 0) -> 8 and 0 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Since Node 4 does not have any neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 5.
    * No other pairs with 5 as the smallest numbered node. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Since Node 6 does not have any neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No other pairs where 8 is the smallest numbered node. No more triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * Since Node 9 does not have any neighbors, no triangles can be formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 0.

Therefore, there are [0 triangles] in the given graph.
