Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Response:
Following the same process as in the example provided earlier, let's calculate the number of triangles in this graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 2 and 3 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 since it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (2, 3) -> 2 and 3 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 9) -> 2 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 2 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 1 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (6, 4) -> 6 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and 6 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8:
    * Skipped as there are no nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, or 3 as they are smaller than 9.
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 9, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
- Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
