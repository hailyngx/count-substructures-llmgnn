Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 2}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {7}

Response:
Let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 7) -> 2 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * The only possible pair is (7, 9), but since 7 is smaller than 9, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> 1 and 2 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 6, and 9:
    * Skipped as they don't have at least 2 nodes greater than them to form triangles.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 5, and 6 as they are smaller than 8.
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 8, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) = 4

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
