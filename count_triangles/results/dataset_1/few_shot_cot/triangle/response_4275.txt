Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 3, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the method described in the example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 7 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs where both neighbors are connected to Node 2.

* Node 3:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs where both neighbors are connected to Node 3.

* Node 4:
    * No triangles possible as all pairs with Node 4 as the smaller numbered node involve smaller nodes.

* Node 5:
    * No triangles possible as all pairs with Node 5 as the smaller numbered node involve smaller nodes.

* Node 6:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs where both neighbors are connected to Node 6.

* Node 7:
    * No triangles possible as all pairs with Node 7 as the smaller numbered node involve smaller nodes.

* Node 8:
    * No triangles possible as there are no pairs where both neighbors are connected to Node 8.

* Node 9:
    * No triangles possible as all pairs with Node 9 as the smaller numbered node involve smaller nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 triangles in the given graph.
