Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {3, 4, 6, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {1, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {4, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {4, 6}

Response:
* Node 0:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3, 4, 6 as they are smaller than 0.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 3 and 4 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 2: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 6 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Pair 3: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and 4 and 8 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (1, 8) -> 1 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and 6 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs as there are no 1-hop neighbors greater than 5.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and 4 and 9 are also connected as shown in the edge list.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 5 as they are smaller than 7.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 8:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 3 as they are smaller than 8.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 4, 6 as they are smaller than 9.
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
