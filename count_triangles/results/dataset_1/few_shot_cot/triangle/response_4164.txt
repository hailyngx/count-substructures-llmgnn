Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {3, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {5, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {5, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {2, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {3, 4, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {0, 1, 5, 6}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as shown in the example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 0 because (3, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 2:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of 3 because (6, 9) is not in the edge list. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 6:
    * No additional triangles can be formed with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are connected as (4, 8) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node.

* Node 9:
    * Pair 1: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 9, and they are connected as (5, 6) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 1

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 1 (Node 9) = 3.

Therefore, there are [3] triangles in the given graph.
