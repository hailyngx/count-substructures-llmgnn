Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {6, 7, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {4, 6, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 2, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {0, 1}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4, 6, 7}

Response:
Following the same process as in the previous example:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>.
    * Pair 2: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 8>.
    * Pair 3: (7, 8) -> 7 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 6>.
    * Pair 2: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
    * Pair 4: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 9>.
    * Pair 6: (8, 9) -> 8 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 2:
    * Skip pairs with nodes lower than 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip pairs with nodes lower than 4.
    * Pair 1: (6, 9) -> 6 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 9>.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Nodes 5, 8, and 9:
    * No triangles can be formed with these nodes.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 3 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Nodes 5, 8, 9) = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 triangles in the given graph.
