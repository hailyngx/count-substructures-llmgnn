Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 2, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 6, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 4, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {2, 4, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {1, 3, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process described in the example, let's count the number of triangles in the provided graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 2) -> No triangle formed between Node 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (0, 2) -> No triangle formed between Node 0, 1, and 2.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs that include Node 0 or 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are connected as (7, 2) and (2, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 3:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1.
    * Pair 1: (6, 7) -> 6 and 7 are both 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are connected as (6, 4) and (4, 7) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 4.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are both 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are connected as (7, 6) and (6, 9) in the edge list. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> 2 and 4 are both 1-hop neighbors of 7, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 8:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 9:
    * No pairs to consider for forming triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 triangles in the given graph.

The triangles are: 
<7, 2, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
