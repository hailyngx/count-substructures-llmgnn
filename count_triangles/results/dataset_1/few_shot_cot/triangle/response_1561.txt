Response:
Following the provided example, let's find the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes.

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (7, 1) -> 7 and 1 are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pairs with Node 0 as it is smaller than 1.
    * Pair 1: (7, 9) -> 7 and 9 are not 1-hop neighbors of each other. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 2:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 2.
    * Pair 1: (3, 4) -> 3 and 4 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (3, 5) -> 3 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (3, 6) -> 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (4, 5) -> 4 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (4, 6) -> 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 8) -> 4 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 10: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 2, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 4

* Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, and 2 as they are smaller than 3.
    * Pair 1: (2, 5) -> 2 and 5 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 6) -> 2 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 8) -> 2 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (5, 6) -> 5 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are directly connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (5, 8) -> 5 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (6, 8) -> 6 and 8 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, but they are not directly connected. No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 3

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
    * Skipped due to being smaller than nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 0 (Node 0) + 0 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) + 3 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 7.

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in the given graph.
