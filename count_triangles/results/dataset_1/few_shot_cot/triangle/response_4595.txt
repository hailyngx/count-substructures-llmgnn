Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {1, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {0, 4, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {4, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {4, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {1, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {0, 1, 4}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {5, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {3, 4, 6, 8}

Response:
Following the step-by-step process mentioned in the example, let's count the triangles in the given graph:

* Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 0, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 1:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 as it is smaller than Node 1.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 1, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 2:
    * No pairs can be formed with Node 2 as there are no edges connected to it.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 3:
    * Pair 1: (4, 9) -> 4 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 3, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 4.
    * Pair 1: (5, 9) -> 5 and 9 are 1-hop neighbors of 4, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 5:
    * No triangles can be formed with Node 5 as there are no pairs of 1-hop neighbors that are also connected.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

* Node 6:
    * Pair 1: (9, 6) -> 9 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors of 6, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 7:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 and 1 as they are smaller than 7.
    * Pair 1: (4, 7) -> 4 and 7 are 1-hop neighbors of 7, and they are also connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 1

* Node 8 and Node 9:
    * Skip as there aren't at least 2 nodes greater than 8 or 9 to form triangles.

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 1 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 0 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 3) + 1 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 6) + 1 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in the given graph.
