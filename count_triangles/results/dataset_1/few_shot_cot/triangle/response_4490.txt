Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
1-hop neighbor set of Node 0 is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 1 is {2, 4, 6, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 2 is {0, 1, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 3 is {0, 6}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 4 is {0, 1, 8, 9}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 5 is {0, 6, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 6 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 7 is {5, 8}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 8 is {4, 7}
1-hop neighbor set of Node 9 is {1, 4}

Response:
Following the same step-by-step process as in the example provided, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

- Node 0:
    * Pair 1: (2, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (2, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (2, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 4: (3, 4) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 5: (3, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 6: (3, 6) -> Node 3 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 7: (4, 5) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 8: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 9: (5, 6) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 0 as the smallest numbered node: 2

- Node 1:
    * Pair 1: (4, 6) -> Node 4 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Pair 2: (4, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Pair 3: (6, 9) -> No triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 1 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 2:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 0 or 1, as they are smaller than Node 2.
    * Pair 1: (6, 0) -> Node 0 and 6 are 1-hop neighbors and they are connected. Triangle formed.
    * Total triangles with Node 2 as the smallest numbered node: 1

- Node 3:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0 or 2 as they are smaller than 3. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 3 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 4:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, or 2 as they are smaller than 4. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 4 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 5:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 as they are smaller than 5. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 5 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 6:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 as they are smaller than 6. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 6 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 7:
    * The only pair we could consider is (5, 8), but since 5 is smaller than 7, this pair is skipped.
    * Total triangles with Node 7 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 8:
    * Skip any pair that includes Node 4 as it is smaller than Node 8. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 8 as the smallest numbered node: 0

- Node 9:
    * Skip any pairs with Nodes 1, 4, or 8 as they are smaller than 9. No other nodes left to form triangles.
    * Total triangles with Node 9 as the smallest numbered node: 0

Summarizing the triangles:
* Total triangles in the graph = 2 (Node 0) + 1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 0 (Node 3) + 0 (Node 4) + 0 (Node 5) + 0 (Node 6) + 0 (Node 7) + 0 (Node 8) + 0 (Node 9) = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in the given graph.
