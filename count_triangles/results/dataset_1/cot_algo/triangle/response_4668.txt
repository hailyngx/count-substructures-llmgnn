Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering of the vertices is:
Vertices: 7, 6, 2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 8, 9, 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (7, 2): Forms triangle with vertex 3 -> <2, 7, 3>
- Edge (6, 1): Forms triangle with vertex 3 -> <1, 6, 3>
- Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 7 -> <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (4, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 7 -> <3, 4, 7>
- Edge (1, 3): Forms triangle with vertex 6 -> <1, 3, 6>
- Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle with vertex 9 -> <0, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
