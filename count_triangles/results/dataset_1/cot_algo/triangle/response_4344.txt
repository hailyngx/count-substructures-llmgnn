Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Node 6: 0 connection
Nodes 2 and 7: 1 connection
Nodes 5 and 8: 2 connections
Nodes 3 and 4: 3 connections
Nodes 1 and 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

We relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 → 1
Node 1 → 2
Node 2 → 3
Node 3 → 4
Node 4 → 5
Node 5 → 6
Node 6 → 7
Node 7 → 8
Node 8 → 9
Node 9 → 10

Now, we will check for triangles using the given edges:

- (0, 1): Nodes 1 and 2 have 4 shared connections. One triangle found: <0, 1, 2>
- (0, 4): Nodes 1 and 5 have 2 shared connections. One triangle found: <0, 1, 5>
- (0, 8): Nodes 1 and 9 have 0 shared connections. No triangle found.
- (1, 3): Nodes 2 and 4 have 1 shared connection. One triangle found: <1, 2, 4>
- (1, 7): Nodes 2 and 8 have 1 shared connection. One triangle found: <1, 2, 8>
- (3, 9): Nodes 4 and 10 have 1 shared connection. One triangle found: <3, 4, 10>
- (4, 0): Nodes 5 and 1 have 2 shared connections. One triangle found: <4, 5, 1>
- (9, 2): Nodes 10 and 3 have 1 shared connection. One triangle found: <9, 10, 3>
- (9, 5): Nodes 10 and 6 have 0 shared connections. No triangle found. 

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
