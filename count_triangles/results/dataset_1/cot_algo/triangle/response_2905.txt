Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
1. Node 7 (0 connections)
2. Node 2 (1 connection)
3. Node 5 (2 connections)
4. Node 9 (2 connections)
5. Node 1 (3 connections)
6. Node 3 (4 connections)
7. Node 4 (4 connections)
8. Node 6 (4 connections)
9. Node 0 (5 connections)
10. Node 8 (6 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges:

We go through the edges in descending order of their lower-degree nodes:

- Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 3): Triangle <8, 3, 1> found
- Edge (8, 4): Triangle <8, 4, 0> found
- Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 4): Triangle <9, 4, 0> found
- Edge (9, 6): Triangle <9, 6, 0> found

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <8, 3, 1>, <8, 4, 0>, <9, 6, 0>
