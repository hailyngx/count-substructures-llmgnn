Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the labels are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Counting the triangles by examining the shared connections in each edge:
- Triangle 1: <1, 8, 9>
- Triangle 2: <1, 9, 2>
- Triangle 3: <3, 4, 5>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 5: <3, 5, 0>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 9: <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle 10: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 11: <3, 9, 6>
- Triangle 12: <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle 13: <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
