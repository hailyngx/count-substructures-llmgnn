Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new ordering is: 

Node 3 (0 connections)
Node 5 (0 connections)
Node 9 (1 connection)
Node 1 (2 connections)
Node 4 (2 connections)
Node 8 (2 connections)
Node 6 (3 connections)
Node 2 (3 connections)
Node 7 (6 connections)
Node 0 (6 connections)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles found are as follows:
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
