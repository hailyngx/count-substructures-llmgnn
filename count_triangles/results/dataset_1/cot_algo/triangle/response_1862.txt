Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2

Next, we need to relabel the nodes based on the degrees in ascending order:

- Node 4: Label 0 (Degree 1)
- Node 2: Label 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 3: Label 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 5: Label 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 9: Label 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 0: Label 5 (Degree 3)
- Node 1: Label 6 (Degree 4)

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 share connections with Nodes 5 and 9 forming the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (0, 9): Nodes 0 and 9 share connections with Node 1 forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- Edge (1, 0): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 3): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 share connection with Node 0 forming the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (3, 1): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (3, 2): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (5, 0): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (5, 1): Nodes 5 and 1 share connection with Node 0 forming the triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangle can be formed.
- Edge (9, 1): Nodes 9 and 1 share connection with Node 0 forming the triangle <0, 1, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>
