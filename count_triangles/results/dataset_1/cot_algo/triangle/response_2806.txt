Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 1  
Node 9: Degree 2  
Node 3: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 6: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 5  
Node 1: Degree 6  
Node 2: Degree 6  

Starting with the edge (0, 2), we can check for triangles along the way:

1. Edge (0, 2):  
   - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 1 and 2, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

2. Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle as node 1 has a higher degree than node 0.

3. Edge (1, 4):  
   - Node 1 shares connections with nodes 2 and 6, forming a triangle <1, 2, 6>.

4. Edge (1, 6):  
   - Node 1 shares connections with nodes 3 and 7, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
   - Node 6 shares connections with nodes 3 and 7, forming another triangle <1, 3, 7>.

5. Edge (1, 7):  
   - Node 1 shares connections with nodes 8 and 4, forming a triangle <1, 4, 8>.

6. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle as node 1 has a higher degree than node 8.

7. Edge (2, 0) has been covered by edge (0, 2).

8. Edge (2, 1) has been covered by edge (1, 2).

9. Edge (2, 4):  
   - Node 2 shares connections with nodes 1 and 6, forming a triangle <1, 2, 6>.

10. Edge (3, 6):  
    - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.

11. Edge (3, 8):  
    - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.

12. Edge (4, 1) has been covered by edge (1, 4).

13. Edge (4, 2) has been covered by edge (2, 4).

14. Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle as node 5 has a higher degree than node 7.

15. Edge (6, 1) has been covered by edge (1, 6).

16. Edge (6, 3):  
    - Node 6 shares connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.
    - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming another triangle <1, 3, 7>.

17. Edge (6, 7):  
    - Node 6 shares connections with nodes 1 and 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
    - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 1 and 3, forming another triangle <1, 3, 7>.

18. Edge (7, 1) has been covered by edge (1, 7).

19. Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle as node 7 has a higher degree than node 5.

20. Edge (7, 6) has been covered by edge (6, 7).

21. Edge (7, 9):  
    - Node 7 shares connections with nodes 1 and 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.

22. Edge (8, 1) has been covered by edge (1, 8).

23. Edge (8, 3):  
    - Node 8 shares connections with nodes 3 and 7, forming a triangle <3, 7, 8>.
    - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 1 and 7, forming another triangle <1, 3, 7>.

24. Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle as node 8 has a higher degree than node 9.

25. Edge (9, 7) has been covered by edge (7, 9).

26. Edge (9, 8) has been covered by edge (8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10].  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<1, 4, 8>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<3, 7, 8>.
