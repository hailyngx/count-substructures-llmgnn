Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6.

Now, we will relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degree:
- Node 7 (Degree 0) becomes Node 0.
- Node 1 (Degree 2) becomes Node 1.
- Node 0 (Degree 3) becomes Node 2.
- Node 9 (Degree 2) becomes Node 3.
- Node 7 (Degree 2) becomes Node 4.
- Node 4 (Degree 2) becomes Node 5.
- Node 6 (Degree 3) becomes Node 6.
- Node 8 (Degree 2) becomes Node 7.
- Node 2 (Degree 3) becomes Node 8.
- Node 5 (Degree 4) becomes Node 9.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

Triangles:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
