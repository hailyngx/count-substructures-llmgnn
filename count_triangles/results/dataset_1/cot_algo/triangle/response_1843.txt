Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Degree-based ordering:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 0
Node 7: degree 6
Node 2: degree 7

Sorted nodes: 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 2
