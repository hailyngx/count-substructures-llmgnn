Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 8 has 0 connection(s).
Node 5 has 1 connection(s).
Node 6 has 1 connection(s).
Node 4 has 2 connection(s).
Node 3 has 3 connection(s).
Node 9 has 3 connection(s).
Node 7 has 4 connection(s).
Node 1 has 4 connection(s).
Node 0 has 5 connection(s).
Node 2 has 6 connection(s).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles: 
[9 triangles]

<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
