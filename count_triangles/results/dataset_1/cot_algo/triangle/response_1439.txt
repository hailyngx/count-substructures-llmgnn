Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are:  
Vertex 3: 0 connections  
Vertex 8: 1 connection  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 3 connections  
Vertex 4: 4 connections  
Vertex 10: 4 connections  
Vertex 9: 5 connections  
Vertex 5: 6 connections  
Vertex 6: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles present in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
