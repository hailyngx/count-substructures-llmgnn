Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
8: 2 connections
9: 5 connections

Now let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections - (0, 3), (1, 2)
Edge (0, 3): Check shared connections - (0, 1), (3, 5)
Edge (0, 8): No triangle
Edge (1, 2): No triangle
Edge (1, 5): Check shared connections - (1, 0), (5, 3)
Edge (2, 3): No triangle
Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections - (2, 1), (3, 7)
Edge (3, 5): Check shared connections - (3, 0), (5, 4)
Edge (3, 7): No triangle
Edge (4, 5): Check shared connections - (4, 9), (5, 9)
Edge (4, 6): No triangle
Edge (4, 9): Check shared connections - (4, 5), (9, 2)
Edge (5, 9): Check shared connections - (5, 1), (9, 4)
Edge (6, 4): No triangle
Edge (7, 3): No triangle
Edge (8, 0): No triangle
Edge (8, 9): Check shared connections - (8, 0), (9, 4)
Edge (9, 2): Check shared connections - (9, 4), (2, 1)
Edge (9, 4): Check shared connections - (9, 5), (4, 5)

Total number of triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 3>, <2, 1, 3>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 9, 4>, <9, 2, 4>.
