Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The vertices are then relabeled accordingly.

After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3 with degree 0 is relabeled as Node 0
- Node 7 with degree 0 is relabeled as Node 1
- Node 8 with degree 0 is relabeled as Node 2
- Node 4 with degree 2 is relabeled as Node 3
- Node 0 with degree 3 is relabeled as Node 4
- Node 5 with degree 4 is relabeled as Node 5
- Node 6 with degree 5 is relabeled as Node 6
- Node 2 with degree 6 is relabeled as Node 7
- Node 9 with degree 6 is relabeled as Node 8

Using these relabeled vertices, we can now identify the triangles by considering each edge while ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the triangles gives us a total of 7 triangles. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, and <5, 6, 9>.
