Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes by the number of connections they have:

Nodes: 7, 1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 9, 8

Now, we relabel the nodes accordingly as: 
Node 7 becomes Node 0
Node 1 becomes Node 1 
Node 0 becomes Node 2 
Node 2 becomes Node 3 
Node 4 becomes Node 4 
Node 6 becomes Node 5 
Node 5 becomes Node 6 
Node 3 becomes Node 7 
Node 9 becomes Node 8 
Node 8 becomes Node 9 

Now, we can check for triangles based on the sorted nodes:

1. Edge (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 are connected to 8, forming a triangle <0, 7, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 are connected to 7, forming a triangle <0, 8, 7>.
3. Edge (2, 6): Nodes 2, 6, and 4 are connected, forming a triangle <2, 6, 4>.
4. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are connected, forming a triangle <3, 4, 6>.
5. Edge (3, 5): Both 3 and 5 are connected to 8, forming a triangle <3, 5, 8>.
6. Edge (3, 8): Nodes 3, 8, and 5 are connected, forming a triangle <3, 8, 5>.
7. Edge (4, 6): Both 4 and 6 are connected to 2, forming a triangle <4, 6, 2>.
8. Edge (5, 8): Nodes 5, 8, and 3 are connected, forming a triangle <5, 8, 3>.
9. Edge (6, 9): Nodes 6, 9, and 5 are connected, forming a triangle <6, 9, 5>.
10. Edge (8, 9): Both 8 and 9 are connected to 5, forming a triangle <8, 9, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
