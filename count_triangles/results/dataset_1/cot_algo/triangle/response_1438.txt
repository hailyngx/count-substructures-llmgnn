Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Initially, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
0 (degree 2)
4 (degree 1)
9 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
6 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
1 (degree 6)

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their sorted order:
0 -> 0
4 -> 1
9 -> 2
5 -> 3
8 -> 4
6 -> 5
3 -> 6
2 -> 7
1 -> 8

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles formed by following the edges in the graph:

Triangles: 
- <0, 1, 6>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
