Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 4: 7 connections
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the order given:

1. (0, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 2 and 4. <0, 2, 4>
2. (1, 5): No triangles formed.
3. (2, 6): Forms a triangle with node 4. <2, 4, 6>
4. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
5. (4, 6): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, and 9. <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>
6. (4, 7): Forms a triangle with node 9. <4, 7, 9>
7. (4, 8): Forms a triangle with node 6. <4, 6, 8>
8. (4, 9): No triangles formed.
9. (5, 1): No triangles formed.
10. (5, 6): Forms a triangle with node 4. <4, 5, 6>
11. (5, 7): Forms a triangle with node 9. <5, 7, 9>
12. (5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4. <4, 5, 9>
13. (6, 0): Forms a triangle with node 4. <0, 4, 6>
14. (6, 2): Forms a triangle with node 4. <2, 4, 6>
15. (6, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 0, 5, and 9. Already counted.
16. (6, 5): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
17. (6, 8): Forms a triangle with node 4. <4, 6, 8>
18. (6, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
19. (7, 4): Forms a triangle with node 9. Already counted.
20. (7, 5): Forms a triangle with node 9. Already counted.
21. (7, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
22. (8, 2): Forms a triangle with node 4. <2, 4, 8>
23. (8, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 6 and 9. Already counted.
24. (8, 6): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
25. (9, 4): Forms triangles with nodes 5 and 6. Already counted.
26. (9, 5): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
27. (9, 6): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.
28. (9, 7): Forms a triangle with node 4. Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [6]
