Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have:  
Vertices: 0, 3, 7, 8, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 9

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- (1, 6): No triangles formed.
- (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>.
- (2, 5): No triangles formed.
- (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- (4, 6): No triangles formed.
- (4, 8): No triangles formed.
- (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 1, 9>.
- (5, 2): No triangles formed.
- (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- (5, 6): Triangle formed: <5, 1, 6>.
- (5, 7): No triangles formed.
- (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- (6, 4): No triangles formed.
- (6, 5): Triangle formed: <6, 1, 9>.
- (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- (7, 5): No triangles formed.
- (8, 1): No triangles formed.
- (8, 4): No triangles formed.
- (9, 1): No triangles formed.
- (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- (9, 4): Triangle formed: <9, 1, 6>.
- (9, 5): No triangles formed.
- (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 8, 9>, <4, 1, 9>, <5, 1, 6>, <6, 1, 9>.
