Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we label them as follows:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:

For the edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections between node 0 and node 2. We find a triangle with node 9: <0, 2, 9>.
For the edge (0, 9): Node 0 has fewer connections than node 9, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections between node 1 and node 2. We find a triangle with node 8: <1, 2, 8>.
For the edge (1, 3): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 3, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (1, 5): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 5, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (1, 8): Check for shared connections between node 1 and node 8. We find a triangle with node 2: <1, 8, 2>.
For the edge (2, 0): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 0, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (2, 1): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (2, 4): Check for shared connections between node 2 and node 4. We find a triangle with node 8: <2, 4, 8>.
For the edge (2, 8): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (2, 9): Node 2 has fewer connections than node 9, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (3, 1): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (3, 9): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 9, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (4, 2): Check for shared connections between node 4 and node 2. We find a triangle with node 8: <4, 2, 8>.
For the edge (4, 8): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (4, 9): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 9, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (5, 1): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (6, 8): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (6, 9): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 9, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (7, 8): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (8, 1): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (8, 2): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 2, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (8, 4): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 4, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (8, 6): Check for shared connections between node 8 and node 6. We find a triangle with node 9: <8, 6, 9>.
For the edge (8, 7): Node 8 has fewer connections than node 7, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (9, 0): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 0, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (9, 2): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 2, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (9, 3): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 3, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (9, 4): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 4, so we skip this edge.
For the edge (9, 6): Node 9 has fewer connections than node 6, so we skip this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 8>.
