Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are labeled as follows based on the number of connections:
- Node 6: 0 connections
- Nodes 1 and 6: 1 connection
- Nodes 2 and 9: 2 connections
- Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8: 3 connections
- Node 3: 7 connections

Examining the edges, we find that only the edges (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), and (1, 9) can form triangles. 

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): No triangles
- For edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- For edge (0, 8): Triangle <0, 8, 7>
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 8, 7>
