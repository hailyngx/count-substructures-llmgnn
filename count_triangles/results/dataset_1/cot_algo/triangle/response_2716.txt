Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order. Then we will relabel the vertices according to their degree.

Degree of each vertex:
0: 3
1: 3
2: 3
3: 2
4: 2
5: 1
6: 5
7: 5
8: 3

Vertices sorted by degree:
5, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 8, 7, 6

The new labels for vertices are:
5: 0
3: 1
4: 2
0: 3
1: 4
2: 5
8: 6
7: 7
6: 8

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the sorted order. 
Checking each edge, we find the following triangles exist:

Triangles: 
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
[6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
