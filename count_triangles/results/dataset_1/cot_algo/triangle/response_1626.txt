Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:

- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 1 edge
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 2 edges
- Node 9: 2 edges

Next, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

- Node 1 (degree 1) -> relabel as Node 0
- Node 3 (degree 2) -> relabel as Node 1
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabel as Node 2
- Node 9 (degree 2) -> relabel as Node 3
- Node 5 (degree 3) -> relabel as Node 4
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> relabel as Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 3) -> relabel as Node 6
- Node 6 (degree 4) -> relabel as Node 7
- Node 0 (degree 4) -> relabel as Node 8
- Node 4 (degree 4) -> relabel as Node 9

Now, we'll list the edges in the order where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- (1, 5)
- (3, 5)
- (8, 0)
- (8, 4)
- (2, 5)
- (6, 4)
- (6, 8)
- (9, 7)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 5)
- (0, 6)
- (4, 2)
- (4, 6)
- (4, 8)

Now, we can count the triangles formed by these edges:

- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
