Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes based on the number of connections:
Nodes: 1, 7, 4  -> 2, 3, 7 -> 6 -> 9 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges using the sorted order:

1. (1, 5):
   - No triangles formed.

2. (7, 0):
   - No triangles formed.

3. (4, 6):
   - No triangles formed.

4. (2, 0):
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

5. (2, 8):
   - No triangles formed.

6. (3, 0):
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.

7. (6, 4):
   - No triangles formed.

8. (9, 2):
   - No triangles formed.

9. (0, 2):
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

10. (3, 8):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>.

11. (5, 0):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.

12. (5, 1):
    - No triangles formed.

13. (6, 5):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.

14. (9, 5):
    - No triangles formed.

15. (0, 7):
    - No triangles formed.

16. (2, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

17. (0, 8):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

18. (5, 6):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.

19. (5, 8):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.

20. (4, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

21. (8, 0):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

22. (8, 2):
    - No triangles formed.

23. (8, 3):
    - No triangles formed.

24. (8, 4):
    - No triangles formed.

25. (8, 5):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>.

26. (8, 6):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.

27. (8, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

28. (1, 5):
    - No triangles formed.

29. (5, 6):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.

30. (5, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

31. (6, 8):
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 6>.

32. (6, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

33. (9, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
