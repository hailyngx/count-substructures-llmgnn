Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Nodes: 1(2) 2(1) 0(4) 3(5) 4(4) 5(4) 6(3) 7(3) 8(4) 9(4)

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 4), (2, 8), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 2), (9, 7)

Now, we will check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to find the triangles:
Triangles: <4, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
