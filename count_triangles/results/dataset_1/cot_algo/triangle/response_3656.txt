Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 3: 5 edges
- Node 0: 5 edges
- Node 7: 6 edges

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 1]
<4, 7, 9>
