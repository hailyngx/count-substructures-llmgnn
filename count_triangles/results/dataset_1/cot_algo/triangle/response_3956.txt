Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 -> 3 connections
1 -> 3 connections
2 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
4 -> 4 connections
5 -> 1 connection
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 3 connections
8 -> 2 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

- (2, 3): Skipped as both vertices have the same degree.
- (5, 1): Skipped as both vertices have the same degree.
- (8, 2): Skipped as both vertices have the same degree.

Considering the remaining edges:
- (0, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <0, 4, 7>
- (0, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- (1, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <1, 6, 7>
- (1, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- (2, 8) doesn't form a triangle.
- (3, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- (4, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
- (4, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 7, 9>
- (4, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (5, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- (6, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
- (6, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- (6, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (7, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- (7, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <7, 4, 9>
- (7, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (8, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- (9, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- (9, 8) doesn't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 9>.
