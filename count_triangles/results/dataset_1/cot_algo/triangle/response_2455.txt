Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 4: Degree 0
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles.

Calculating triangles for edge (0, 1):
Both nodes 0 and 1 have degree 2. They share a common connection with node 2, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

Calculating triangles for edge (0, 2):
Both nodes 0 and 2 have degree 2. They share a common connection with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

Calculating triangles for edge (1, 3):
Both nodes 1 and 3 have degree 2. They share a common connection with node 7, forming a triangle <1, 3, 7>.

Calculating triangles for edge (2, 3):
Both nodes 2 and 3 have degree 2. They share a common connection with node 7, forming a triangle <2, 3, 7>.

Calculating triangles for edge (3, 7):
Node 3 has degree 4, while node 7 has degree 2. They share a common connection with node 6, forming a triangle <3, 7, 6>.

Calculating triangles for edge (3, 9):
Node 3 has degree 4, while node 9 has degree 2. They share a common connection with node 6, forming a triangle <3, 9, 6>.

Calculating triangles for edge (7, 6):
Node 7 has degree 2, while node 6 has degree 3. They share a common connection with node 9, forming a triangle <7, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
