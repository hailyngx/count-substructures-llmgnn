Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 7 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 0 and 8 have 5 connections each.
Node 3 has 6 connections.
Node 9 has 8 connections.

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their sorted degrees:

Node 7 (0 connections) -> Node A
Nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 (1 connection each) -> Nodes B, C, D, E, F
Nodes 0, 8 (5 connections each) -> Nodes G, H
Node 3 (6 connections) -> Node I
Node 9 (8 connections) -> Node J

Now, we will check each edge following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3) - Proceeding since G < I and they share a connection with node 9 forming triangle <0, 3, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 4) - Proceeding since G < F and they share a connection with node 9 forming triangle <0, 4, 9>.
3. Edge (0, 5) - Proceeding since G < E and there's no triangle formed.
4. Edge (0, 8) - Proceeding since G < H and there's no triangle formed.
5. Edge (0, 9) - Proceeding since G < J and there's no triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 3) - Proceeding since B < I and there's no triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 4) - Proceeding since B < F and there's no triangle formed.
8. Edge (1, 8) - Proceeding since B < H and there's no triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 4) - Proceeding since C < F and there's no triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 9) - Proceeding since C < J and there's no triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 0) - Skipped as I > G.
12. Edge (3, 1) - Proceeding since I < B and there's no triangle formed.
13. Edge (3, 9) - Proceeding since I < J and there's no triangle formed.
14. Edge (4, 0) - Skipped as F > G.
15. Edge (4, 1) - Skipped as F > B.
16. Edge (4, 2) - Proceeding since F < C and there's no triangle formed.
17. Edge (4, 6) - Proceeding since F < E and there's no triangle formed.
18. Edge (4, 9) - Proceeding since F < J and there's no triangle formed.
19. Edge (5, 0) - Skipped as E > G.
20. Edge (5, 6) - Proceeding since E < F and there's no triangle formed.
21. Edge (6, 4) - Skipped as E > F.
22. Edge (6, 5) - Skipped as E > F.
23. Edge (8, 0) - Skipped as H > G.
24. Edge (8, 1) - Skipped as H > B.
25. Edge (8, 9) - Proceeding since H < J and there's no triangle formed.
26. Edge (9, 0) - Skipped as J > G.
27. Edge (9, 2) - Skipped as J > C.
28. Edge (9, 3) - Skipped as J > I.
29. Edge (9, 4) - Proceeding since J < F and there's no triangle formed.
30. Edge (9, 8) - Proceeding since J < H and there's no triangle formed.
