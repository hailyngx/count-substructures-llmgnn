Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 4: 8 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles as follows:
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 7, 9>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
