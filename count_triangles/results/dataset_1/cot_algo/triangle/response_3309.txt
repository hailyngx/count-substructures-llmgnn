Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following relabeling:  
Node 2 has 1 connection  
Node 8 has 1 connection  
Node 0 has 3 connections  
Node 7 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 3 connections  
Node 4 has 3 connections  
Node 6 has 3 connections  
Node 5 has 4 connections  
Node 3 has 5 connections  
Node 1 has 5 connections  

Now, we analyze the edges starting from the ones involving nodes with lower degrees:

- Edge (2, 5) is skipped as node 2 has fewer connections than node 5.
- Edge (8, 3) is skipped as node 8 has fewer connections than node 3.

Now, we look at the remaining edges.  
Checking edge (0, 1):  
Both nodes have 3 connections. Shared connections: 3.  
Triangle found: <0, 1, 3>

Checking edge (0, 3):  
Node 0 has 3 connections, which is fewer than node 3's 5 connections.  
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

Checking edge (0, 7):  
Node 0 has 3 connections, which is fewer than node 7's 3 connections.  
No triangles found.

Checking edge (1, 3):  
Both nodes have 5 connections. Shared connections: 3.

Node 6 has 3 connections, which is fewer than node 7's 3 connections.  
No triangles found.

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 1>
