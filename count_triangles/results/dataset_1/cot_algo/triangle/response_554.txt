Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:

Vertices: 
0 - degree 4
2 - degree 5
3 - degree 4
4 - degree 5
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 2
7 - degree 2
8 - degree 2
9 - degree 5

Now, we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method, considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 9, 6>
