Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 0
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangle 1: <0, 3, 6>
Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
Triangle 3: <0, 3, 9>
Triangle 4: <1, 4, 7>
Triangle 5: <1, 4, 9>
Triangle 6: <3, 4, 7>
Triangle 7: <3, 4, 9>
Triangle 8: <3, 6, 7>
Triangle 9: <3, 6, 9>
Triangle 10: <3, 7, 9>
Triangle 11: <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
