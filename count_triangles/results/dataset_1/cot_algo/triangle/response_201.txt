Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then we will proceed with counting the triangles based on the described method.

The sorted vertices are: 

Vertex 8 (degree 0)
Vertex 1 (degree 1)
Vertex 4 (degree 1)
Vertex 3 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 4)
Vertex 0 (degree 4)
Vertex 7 (degree 4)
Vertex 9 (degree 4)
Vertex 6 (degree 5)
Vertex 2 (degree 5)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
- For edge (2, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (2, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
- For edge (2, 7): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.
- For edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 2): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7>.
- For edge (7, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
- For edge (9, 6): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
- For edge (9, 7): Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
