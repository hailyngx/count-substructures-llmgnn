Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 4, 0, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 1 has 5 connections. Shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 2 has 3 connections. Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
3. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 5 connections and vertex 3 has 3 connections. Shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <1, 0, 3>.
4. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has 5 connections and vertex 5 has 2 connections. No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 5 connections and vertex 7 has 5 connections. Shared connections with vertices 5 and 6. Triangles <1, 5, 7> and <1, 6, 7>.
6. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and vertex 3 has 3 connections. Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <2, 1, 3>.
7. Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 has 3 connections and vertex 6 has 4 connections. Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <2, 6, 7>.
8. Edge (3, 2): Vertex 3 has 3 connections and vertex 2 has 3 connections. Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <3, 1, 2>.
9. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 7 has 5 connections. Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <6, 1, 7>.
10. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 4 connections and vertex 8 has 4 connections. Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <6, 7, 8>.
11. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 has 5 connections and vertex 5 has 2 connections. No triangle formed.
12. Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has 5 connections and vertex 8 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
13. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 4 connections and vertex 9 has 1 connection. No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 1, 3>, <2, 6, 7>.
