Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 5

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: Degree 1 --> Label 0
Node 2: Degree 1 --> Label 1
Node 4: Degree 1 --> Label 2
Node 5: Degree 2 --> Label 3
Node 6: Degree 3 --> Label 4
Node 7: Degree 3 --> Label 5
Node 3: Degree 4 --> Label 6
Node 9: Degree 5 --> Label 7

Next, we analyze the edges in ascending order based on the lower labeled vertex:

Edge (0, 4): Forms triangle <0, 4, 5>
Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed
Edge (3, 5): Forms triangle <3, 5, 9>
Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed
Edge (4, 0): Forms triangle <0, 4, 5>
Edge (5, 2): No triangles formed
Edge (5, 3): Forms triangle <3, 5, 9>
Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed
Edge (6, 9): Forms triangle <6, 7, 9>
Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed
Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed
Edge (9, 3): Forms triangle <3, 5, 9>
Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle <6, 7, 9>
Edge (9, 7): Forms triangle <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>
