Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph with vertices relabeled based on their degree is: 
- Node 0 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 6 has 2 connections
- Node 7 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 1 connection

Based on the degree-based ordering, the edges to consider are: 
(0, 4), (2, 5), (4, 0), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), (9, 3)

Now, examining these edges for shared connections to form triangles: 
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <3, 7, 6>
- Triangle <3, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
