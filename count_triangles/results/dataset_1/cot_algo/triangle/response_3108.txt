Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels: 

Node 2: Degree 0  
Node 9: Degree 2  
Node 7: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 5: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 5  
Node 1: Degree 5  
Node 3: Degree 6  
Node 8: Degree 6  
Node 0: Degree 7
