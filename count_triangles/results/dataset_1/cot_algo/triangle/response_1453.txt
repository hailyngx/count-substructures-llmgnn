Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Nodes 7 and 8: 1 connection each
Nodes 3 and 9: 2 connections each
Nodes 1 and 4: 3 connections each
Nodes 0 and 2: 4 connections each
Node 6: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 5).

Analyzing the edges:

(0, 4): Forms a triangle with node 2 <0, 2, 4>
(0, 6): Forms a triangle with node 1 <0, 1, 6>
(1, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0 <1, 0, 6>
(1, 9): Forms a triangle with node 5 <1, 5, 9>
(2, 3): Does not form a triangle
(2, 4): Forms a triangle with node 0 <2, 0, 4>
(3, 2): Does not form a triangle
(4, 0): Does not form a triangle
(5, 9): Does not form a triangle
(6, 0): Forms a triangle with node 4 <6, 0, 4>
(6, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0 <6, 0, 1>
(6, 7): Does not form a triangle
(6, 8): Does not form a triangle
(7, 6): Does not form a triangle
(8, 6): Does not form a triangle
(9, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0 <9, 0, 1>
(9, 5): Does not form a triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
