Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other.
