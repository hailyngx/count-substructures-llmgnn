Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Triangles found:
<4, 0, 5>
<9, 4, 0>
<7, 3, 2>
<9, 7, 2>
<8, 1, 5>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 7, 5>

Total number of triangles: [7]
