Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 8: 0 connections
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we will look at each edge and count the triangles formed:

(0, 2):
Both 0 and 2 have 4 connections. Since 0 < 2, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 5 and 9, forming triangles <0, 2, 5> and <0, 2, 9>.

(0, 5):
0 has 4 connections and 5 has 4 connections. Since 0 < 5, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 2 and 9, forming triangle <0, 5, 2>.

(0, 9):
0 has 4 connections and 9 has 4 connections. Since 0 < 9, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 2 and 5, forming triangle <0, 9, 2>.

(1, 2):
1 has 3 connections and 2 has 6 connections. Since 1 < 2, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 3, forming a triangle <1, 2, 3>.

(1, 3):
1 has 3 connections and 3 has 3 connections. Since 1 < 3, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 2 and 6, forming triangle <1, 3, 2>.

(2, 5):
Both 2 and 5 have 4 connections. Since 2 < 5, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 0, forming a triangle <2, 5, 0>.

(2, 6):
Both 2 and 6 have 4 connections. Since 2 < 6, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 1 and 5, forming triangle <2, 6, 1>.

(2, 9):
Both 2 and 9 have 4 connections. Since 2 < 9, we check for shared connections. They share connections with nodes 0 and 5, forming triangle <2, 9, 0>.

(3, 6):
3 has 3 connections and 6 has 4 connections. Since 3 < 6, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <3, 6, 2>.

(3, 7):
Both 3 and 7 have 3 connections. Since 3 < 7, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 6, forming a triangle <3, 7, 6>.

(5, 6):
Both 5 and 6 have 4 connections. Since 5 < 6, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <5, 6, 2>.

(5, 9):
Both 5 and 9 have 4 connections. Since 5 < 9, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 0, forming a triangle <5, 9, 0>.

(6, 7):
Both 6 and 7 have 4 connections. Since 6 < 7, we check for shared connections. They share a connection with node 3, forming a triangle <6, 7, 3>.

Total number of triangles: [11]
