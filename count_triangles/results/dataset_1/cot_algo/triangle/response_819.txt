Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 has 3 connections.  
Node 1 has 3 connections.  
Node 4 has 3 connections.  
Node 5 has 3 connections.  
Node 6 has 3 connections.  
Node 8 has 3 connections.  
Node 3 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 4 connections.  
Node 9 has 5 connections.  
Node 2 has 5 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the order of the vertices' labels.

Triangles formed by shared connections:  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 3, 9>  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 8, 4>  
<1, 8, 6>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<6, 8, 1>  
<6, 8, 2>
