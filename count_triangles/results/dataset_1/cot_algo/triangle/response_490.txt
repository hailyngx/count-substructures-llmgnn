Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections.

The sorted vertices are: 
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertices 1, 5, 7: 4 connections
Vertices 2, 3, 4: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 9 connections

Next, we will analyze the edges starting from vertices with the lower labels and fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>

Finally, counting the total number of triangles gives us the answer:
