Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
We will start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

We will now relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 7: 6 connections

We will now go through each edge and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): No triangles
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangles
3. Edge (1, 5): No triangles
4. Edge (2, 0): No triangles
5. Edge (3, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 4>
6. Edge (3, 8): No triangles
7. Edge (3, 9): No triangles
8. Edge (4, 0): No triangles
9. Edge (4, 5): Triangle <4, 5, 7>
10. Edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 7>
11. Edge (4, 7): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
12. Edge (5, 1): No triangles
13. Edge (5, 4): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
14. Edge (5, 6): No triangles
15. Edge (5, 7): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
16. Edge (6, 4): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
17. Edge (6, 5): No triangles
18. Edge (6, 7): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
19. Edge (7, 3): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
20. Edge (7, 4): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
21. Edge (7, 5): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
22. Edge (7, 6): No additional triangles (triangle already counted)
23. Edge (7, 8): No triangles
24. Edge (8, 3): No triangles
25. Edge (8, 7): No triangles
26. Edge (9, 3): No triangles

Count of triangles: [3]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3. The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
