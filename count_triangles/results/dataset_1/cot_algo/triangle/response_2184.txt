Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 3
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 6 has degree 1
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 3

Now we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method and count the number of triangles based on the shared connections:

[Total number of triangles: 3]
<Triangles: <1, 5, 3>, <1, 0, 3>, <2, 9, 7>>
