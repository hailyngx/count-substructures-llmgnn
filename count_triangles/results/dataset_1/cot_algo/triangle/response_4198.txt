Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows the steps mentioned below:
1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order.
2. Relabel the vertices accordingly.
3. For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
4. Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge; these shared connections form triangles.

In this case, the vertices can be sorted based on their degrees as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Following the steps mentioned above, the triangles found in the graph are as follows:
- <3, 1, 9>
- <3, 1, 9>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <1, 9, 6>
- <1, 9, 6>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <8, 7, 4>
- <8, 7, 4>
- <7, 8, 3>
- <7, 8, 3>
- <3, 9, 6>
- <3, 9, 6>

Therefore, there are [20] triangles in the given graph.
