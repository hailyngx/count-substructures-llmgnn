Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3 -> 0 connections
Node 7 -> 1 connection
Node 2 -> 2 connections
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 5 connections
Node 5 -> 5 connections
Node 0 -> 6 connections
Node 9 -> 6 connections
Node 4 -> 7 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): Node 3 has no connections, so we skip this edge.
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 3 has no connections, so we skip this edge.
3. Edge (0, 9): Node 3 has no connections, so we skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 2): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
5. Edge (1, 4): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
6. Edge (1, 5): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
7. Edge (1, 6): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
8. Edge (1, 7): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
9. Edge (1, 8): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
10. Edge (2, 1): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 8, forming triangle: <1, 2, 8>.
11. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 2, 8>.
12. Edge (4, 0): Node 8 has 2 connections, so we skip this edge.
13. Edge (4, 1): Node 8 has 2 connections, so we skip this edge.
14. Edge (4, 5): Node 8 has 2 connections, so we skip this edge.
15. Edge (4, 6): Node 8 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 4, 6>.
16. Edge (4, 8): Node 8 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 4, 8>.
17. Edge (5, 1): Node 5 and Node 7 share Node 4, forming triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
18. Edge (5, 4): Node 5 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
19. Edge (6, 0): Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 4, forming triangle: <0, 4, 6>.
20. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 4, forming triangle: <1, 4, 6>.
21. Edge (6, 4): Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 5, forming triangle: <1, 4, 6>.
22. Edge (6, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 share Node 4, forming triangle: <1, 6, 7>.
23. Edge (7, 1): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
24. Edge (7, 6): Node 7 has 1 connection, so we skip this edge.
25. Edge (8, 1): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 4, forming triangle: <1, 4, 8>.
26. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 2, 8>.
27. Edge (8, 4): Node 2 and Node 7 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 4, 8>.
28. Edge (8, 9): Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 1, forming triangle: <1, 8, 9>.
29. Edge (9, 0): Node 6 has 3 connections, so we skip this edge.
30. Edge (9, 8): Node 6 has 3 connections, so we skip this edge.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, and <1, 6, 7>.
