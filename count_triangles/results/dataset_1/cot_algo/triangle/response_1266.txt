Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes sorted by their number of connections are: 1, 2, 4, 7, 0, 5, 6, 9, 8, 3.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:

Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: <0, 5, 9>
