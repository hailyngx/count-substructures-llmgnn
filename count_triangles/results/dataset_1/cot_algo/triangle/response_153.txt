Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their degree:

0: 0 connections
3: 1 connection
9: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
8: 7 connections

Next, we use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Triangles: 6
<1, 5, 8> 
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 8> 
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 7, 1>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
