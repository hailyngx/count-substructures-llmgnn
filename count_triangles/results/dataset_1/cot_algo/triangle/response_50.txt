Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
```
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
```

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle <0, 9, 4>.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle <1, 8, 0>.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle <3, 8, 1>.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.

Count of triangles = 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
