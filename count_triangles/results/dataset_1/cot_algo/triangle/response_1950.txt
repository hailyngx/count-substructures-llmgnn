Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices along with their degrees:

(0: 2), (3: 2), (2: 0), (5: 3), (7: 3), (6: 4), (1: 5), (8: 5), (9: 6), (4: 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by examining the edges:

1. Considering edge (0, 4):
   Both 0 and 4 have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.

2. Considering edge (1, 4):
   Vertex 1 has 5 connections and vertex 4 has 6 connections. They both have connections with vertices 6 and 9, forming triangles <1, 6, 4> and <1, 9, 4>.

3. Considering edge (1, 6):
   Both 1 and 6 have 4 connections. They share vertices 4 and 9, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

4. Considering edge (1, 7):
   Vertex 1 has 5 connections and vertex 7 has 3 connections. They have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming triangle <1, 5, 7>.

5. Considering edge (1, 9):
   Both 1 and 9 have 6 connections. They share vertices 4 and 6, forming triangle <1, 4, 6>.

6. Considering edge (3, 9):
   Both 3 and 9 have 2 connections. No triangles are formed.

7. Considering edge (4, 0):
   This was already considered in step 1.

8. Considering edge (4, 1):
   This was already considered in step 2.

9. Continuing this process for all edges, the total number of triangles found is: [4].

Triangles found:
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 9, 4>
