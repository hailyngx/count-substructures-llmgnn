Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
0 (degree 3) <br>
1 (degree 3) <br>
2 (degree 1) <br>
3 (degree 4) <br>
4 (degree 3) <br>
5 (degree 4) <br>
6 (degree 3) <br>
7 (degree 1) <br>
8 (degree 3) <br>
9 (degree 5) 

Now, let's find the triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <3, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [2]
