Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:  
Vertices: 5, 7, 1, 4, 6, 3, 2, 0, 8, 9  

Now, we analyze the edges considering only the ones where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangles with 6, 8  
- Edge (1, 7) forms triangles with 9  
- Edge (2, 3) forms triangles with 6, 8, 9  
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with 9  
- Edge (5, 0) forms triangles with 6, 8  
- Edge (6, 0) forms triangles with 8  
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with 8  
- Edge (6, 8) does not result in a new triangle  
- Edge (7, 1) forms a triangle with 9  
- Edge (8, 0) does not result in a new triangle  
- Edge (8, 2) does not result in a new triangle  
- Edge (8, 4) does not result in a new triangle  
- Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with 7  
- Edge (9, 3) does not result in a new triangle  
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle with 7  
- Edge (9, 7) does not result in a new triangle  

Counting the triangles found, we have a total of [8] triangles.  
The unique triangles are: <0, 6, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <6, 0, 8>, <7, 1, 9>.
