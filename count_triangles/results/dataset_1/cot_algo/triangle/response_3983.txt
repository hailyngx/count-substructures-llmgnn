Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
```
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
```

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <1, 4, 9>
4. <1, 4, 2>
5. <3, 7, 5>
6. <5, 7, 8>
7. <5, 6, 8>
8. <7, 8, 6>
9. <8, 6, 9>
10. <5, 6, 9>
11. <6, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [11]
