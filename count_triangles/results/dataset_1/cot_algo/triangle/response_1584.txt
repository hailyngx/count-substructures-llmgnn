Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows: 

Node 1 (degree 1): 1  
Node 0 (degree 2): 0  
Node 9 (degree 2): 2  
Node 4 (degree 3): 3  
Node 8 (degree 3): 4  
Node 6 (degree 4): 5  
Node 5 (degree 5): 6  
Node 7 (degree 5): 7  
Node 2 (degree 5): 8  
Node 3 (degree 6): 9  

Now, let's check for triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge: (0, 5) - Node 0 and Node 5 share connections with Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge: (0, 6) - No triangles formed.
3. Edge: (1, 7) - No triangles formed.
4. Edge: (2, 3) - No triangles formed.
5. Edge: (2, 5) - No triangles formed.
6. Edge: (2, 8) - No triangles formed.
7. Edge: (3, 2) - No triangles formed.
8. Edge: (3, 4) - No triangles formed.
9. Edge: (3, 5) - Node 3 and Node 5 share connections, forming a triangle <3, 5, 0>.
10. Edge: (3, 9) - No triangles formed.
11. Edge: (4, 3) - Node 3 and Node 4 share connections with Node 6, forming a triangle <3, 6, 4>.
12. Edge: (4, 6) - Node 3 and Node 6 share connections with Node 5, forming a triangle <3, 5, 6>.
13. Edge: (4, 7) - Node 4 and Node 7 share connections with Node 6, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
14. Edge: (5, 0) - No triangles formed.
15. Edge: (5, 2) - No triangles formed.
16. Edge: (5, 3) - No triangles formed.
17. Edge: (5, 6) - Node 6 and Node 5 share connections, forming a triangle <6, 5, 3>.
18. Edge: (5, 7) - Node 5 and Node 7 share connections with Node 4, forming a triangle <5, 4, 7>.
19. Edge: (5, 8) - No triangles formed.
20. Edge: (6, 0) - No triangles formed.
21. Edge: (6, 4) - No triangles formed.
22. Edge: (6, 5) - No triangles formed.
23. Edge: (6, 7) - Node 6 and Node 7 share connections with Node 5, forming a triangle <6, 5, 7>.
24. Edge: (7, 1) - No triangles formed.
25. Edge: (7, 4) - No triangles formed.
26. Edge: (7, 5) - No triangles formed.
27. Edge: (7, 6) - No triangles formed.
28. Edge: (7, 8) - No triangles formed.
29. Edge: (7, 9) - No triangles formed.
30. Edge: (8, 2) - No triangles formed.
31. Edge: (8, 5) - No triangles formed.
32. Edge: (8, 7) - No triangles formed.
33. Edge: (9, 3) - No triangles formed.
34. Edge: (9, 7) - No triangles formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 5, 7>.
