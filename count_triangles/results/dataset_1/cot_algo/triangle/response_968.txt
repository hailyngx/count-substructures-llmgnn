Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:
1. For edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
2. For edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
3. For edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
4. For edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
5. For edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
6. For edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
7. For edge (4, 1): No triangles formed.
8. For edge (4, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 4>.
9. For edge (4, 7): Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
10. For edge (5, 7): No triangles formed.
11. For edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
12. For edge (5, 9): Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
13. For edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
14. For edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
15. For edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
16. For edge (7, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
17. For edge (7, 5): Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
18. For edge (7, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 7>.
19. For edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
20. For edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
21. For edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.
22. For edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
23. For edge (9, 5): Triangle <4, 5, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 9>.
