Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 4 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 0
- Node 8 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 1
- Node 0 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 2
- Node 2 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 3
- Node 3 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 4
- Node 6 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 5
- Node 5 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 6
- Node 1 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 7
- Node 7 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 8
- Node 9 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 9

Now, we will list the edges based on the new labels:
(0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <7, 9, 0>
- Triangle 2: <7, 9, 2>
- Triangle 3: <7, 9, 3>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 3>
- Triangle 5: <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle 6: <1, 8, 7>
- Triangle 7: <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle 8: <2, 0, 6>
- Triangle 9: <2, 0, 7>
- Triangle 10: <2, 6, 5>
- Triangle 11: <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle 12: <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle 13: <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle 14: <9, 0, 2>
- Triangle 15: <9, 0, 6>
- Triangle 16: <9, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
