Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 1
Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 3
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 6 (6 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will check for triangles:

<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
