Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
0: 2, 4, 6, 7  
1: 2, 5, 8  
2: 0, 1, 6, 9  
3: 5, 6, 9  
4: 0  
5: 1, 3  
6: 0, 2, 3, 7  
7: 0, 6, 9  
8: 1  
9: 2, 3, 7  

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees in non-increasing order:  
0: 4  
1: 3  
2: 4  
3: 3  
4: 1  
5: 2  
6: 4  
7: 3  
8: 1  
9: 4  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting the triangles (denoted by []), we find that there are 3 triangles in the graph:
[3]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 6>
