Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices based on the number of connections:
- Vertex 0 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 3 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 9 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 7

Given that we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the edges to be considered are:
- (0, 8)
- (1, 5)
- (3, 5)
- (4, 6)
- (6, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
