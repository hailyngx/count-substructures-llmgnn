Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices with connections (sorted by number of connections): 5, 9, 3, 8, 1, 3, 0, 6, 4, 7

Triangles:
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 7, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 8, 1>
<4, 7, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
