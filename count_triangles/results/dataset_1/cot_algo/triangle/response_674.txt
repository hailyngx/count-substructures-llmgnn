Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new vertex order is: 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 2, 0, 4.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles formed by the following edges:
- (2, 0) shares a connection with 7 to form a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- (2, 7) shares connections with 4 and 0 to form triangles <0, 2, 7> and <4, 2, 7>.
- (3, 4) shares connections with 7 and 9 to form triangles <3, 4, 7> and <3, 4, 9>.
- (4, 2) and (4, 7) share a connection with 0 to form a triangle <0, 2, 7>.
- (4, 9) and (9, 3) share a connection with 7 to form a triangle <3, 4, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
