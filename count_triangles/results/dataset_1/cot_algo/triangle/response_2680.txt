Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: <9, 1, 8, 0, 6, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7>.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
