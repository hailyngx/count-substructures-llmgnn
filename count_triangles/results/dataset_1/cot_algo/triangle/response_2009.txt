Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle <0, 6, 1>
- Triangle <3, 9, 4>
- Triangle <3, 9, 7>
- Triangle <3, 0, 6>
- Triangle <4, 9, 7>
- Triangle <6, 4, 7>
- Triangle <6, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [10]
