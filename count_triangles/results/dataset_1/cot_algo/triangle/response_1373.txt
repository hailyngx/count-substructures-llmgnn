Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections. 

The sorted list of vertices with the number of connections is as follows:
(9: 1), (7: 2), (3: 2), (8: 2), (1: 3), (2: 4), (4: 4), (6: 4), (5: 5), (0: 5)

Now, we consider the edges going from vertices with a lower label to vertices with a higher label, to ensure each triangle is only counted once.

By checking the shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
