Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 (degree 3), 1 (degree 3), 3 (degree 2), 6 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 5 (degree 4), 7 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking edge (0, 1): Both vertices have the same degree so proceed with the lower label (vertex 0).
Vertex 0 and vertex 1 share 1 common connection (vertex 5). This forms a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

Checking edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has a lower degree than vertex 5, so proceed.
Vertex 0 and vertex 5 share 1 common connection (vertex 1). This forms a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

Checking edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has a lower degree than vertex 9, so proceed.
Vertex 0 and vertex 9 share 1 common connection (vertex 1). This forms a triangle <0, 1, 9>.

Checking edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has a lower degree than vertex 5, so proceed.
Vertex 1 and vertex 5 share 1 common connection (vertex 0). This forms a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

Checking edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has a lower degree than vertex 9, so proceed.
Vertex 1 and vertex 9 share 1 common connection (vertex 0). This forms a triangle <0, 1, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>.
