Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each node are: 
- Node 0: degree 3 
- Node 5: degree 2 
- Node 6: degree 2 
- Node 8: degree 3 
- Node 4: degree 3 
- Node 7: degree 3 
- Node 2: degree 4 
- Node 9: degree 4 
- Node 1: degree 5 
- Node 3: degree 4 

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 

We start with the edge (0, 1) since Node 0 has the lowest label among the two vertices in this edge. Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 1 has 5 connections, so we proceed.

Checking shared connections, we find that Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2 form a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

Moving on to the next edge, we have (0, 2). Nodes 0 and 2 have 3 and 4 connections respectively. We proceed.

Checking shared connections, we find that Node 0, Node 2, and Node 7 form a triangle <0, 2, 7>.

Continuing this process for all edges, we count the total number of triangles and list them once:

[Total number of triangles: 27]
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
