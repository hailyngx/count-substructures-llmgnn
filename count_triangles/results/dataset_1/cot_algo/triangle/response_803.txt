Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 1 --- 3 --- 8
|     |     |     |
|     |     |     |
4     5 --- 6     7
           |
           2
```

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get:
Nodes: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 0, 5, 8, 1, 3

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- For edge (0, 1):
  - Node 0: Connected to 1, 4, 7
  - Node 1: Connected to 0, 3, 5, 9
  - Shared connections: 0
  - Triangles: <0, 1, 3>

- For edge (0, 4):
  - Node 0: Connected to 1, 4, 7
  - Node 4: Connected to 0, 3
  - Shared connections: 0
  - Triangles: <0, 4, 3>

- For edge (0, 7):
  - Node 0: Connected to 1, 4, 7
  - Node 7: Connected to 0, 5, 8
  - Shared connections: 0
  - Triangles: <0, 7, 5>

- For edge (1, 3):
  - Node 1: Connected to 0, 3, 5, 9
  - Node 3: Connected to 1, 4, 8, 9
  - Shared connections: 1
  - Triangles: <1, 3, 4>

- For edge (1, 5):
  - Node 1: Connected to 0, 3, 5, 9
  - Node 5: Connected to 1, 6, 7, 8
  - Shared connections: 1
  - Triangles: <1, 5, 7>

- For edge (3, 4):
  - Node 3: Connected to 1, 4, 8, 9
  - Node 4: Connected to 0, 3
  - Shared connections: 3
  - Triangles: <3, 4, 0>

- For edge (4, 8):
  - Node 4: Connected to 0, 3
  - Node 8: Connected to 3, 5, 7
  - Shared connections: 3
  - Triangles: <4, 8, 3>
