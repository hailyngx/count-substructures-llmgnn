Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
5: 6 connections
2: 7 connections
6: 8 connections

Now, let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

0 (2 connections) - 8 (2 connections) - 6 (8 connections) forms a triangle
0 (2 connections) - 8 (2 connections) - 9 (2 connections) forms a triangle
0 (2 connections) - 9 (2 connections) - 6 (8 connections) forms a triangle
8 (2 connections) - 9 (2 connections) - 6 (8 connections) forms a triangle

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].

Unique triangles found:
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<8, 9, 6>
