Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

    1 - 0 - 3
    |     | /
    5 - 2   6 - 7
        | / | /
        8 - 4
          |
          9

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
2, 4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 0

Edges where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections:
(2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 6), (8, 9)

Now, let's find the triangles formed by these edges:
1. Triangle: <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
