Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3 and Node 8 have 0 connections.
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 5 have 1 connection.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 and Node 6 have 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are counted as follows:
- Triangle <4, 9, 7> formed by the connections (4, 9) and (9, 7).
- Triangle <4, 9, 8> formed by the connections (4, 9) and (9, 8).
- Triangle <4, 7, 9> formed by the connections (4, 7) and (7, 9).
- Triangle <4, 7, 9> formed by the connections (4, 7) and (7, 9).
- Triangle <8, 9, 5> formed by the connections (8, 9) and (9, 5).
- Triangle <7, 9, 8> formed by the connections (7, 9) and (9, 8).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
