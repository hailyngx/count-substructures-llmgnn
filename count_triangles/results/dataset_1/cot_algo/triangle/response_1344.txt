Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 6

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge based on the ordering of the vertices. The triangles are primarily formed by shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

We have a total of 8 triangles in this graph, and they are: 
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [8].
