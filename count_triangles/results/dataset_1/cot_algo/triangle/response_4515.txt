Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in an ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: 7, 3, 0, 1, 2, 5, 9, 4, 6, 8
Edges: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Number of triangles: 5]
<0, 4, 3>
<0, 8, 5>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 7, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
