Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is: 

Node 1 (1 connection): 5  
Node 2 (1 connection): 6  
Node 3 (2 connections): 9  
Node 4 (2 connections): 0  
Node 5 (2 connections): 1  
Node 6 (2 connections): 8  
Node 7 (3 connections): 4  
Node 8 (3 connections): 2  
Node 9 (4 connections): 7  
Node 10 (4 connections): 3  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 2 (0, 2, 3)  
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed  
3. Edge (0, 7): Forms a triangle with node 1 (0, 1, 7)  
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed  
5. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed  
6. Edge (3, 0): Already counted  
7. Edge (3, 2): Already counted  
8. Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1 (3, 7, 9)  
9. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed  
10. Edge (4, 6): No triangles formed  
11. Edge (4, 7): Already counted  
12. Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with node 3 (4, 7, 8)  
13. Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed  
14. Edge (6, 4): Already counted  
15. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 2 (6, 7, 8)  
16. Edge (7, 0): Already counted  
17. Edge (7, 4): Already counted  
18. Edge (7, 6): Already counted  
19. Edge (7, 8): Already counted  
20. Edge (8, 4): Already counted  
21. Edge (8, 7): Already counted  
22. Edge (9, 3): Already counted  

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].  
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <4, 7, 8>.
