Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 0 has 2 connections, Node 4 has 1 connection, Node 8 has 1 connection, Node 6 has 2 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections, Node 3 has 4 connections, Node 5 has 4 connections, Node 1 has 6 connections, and Node 2 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges between nodes to count the total number of triangles and list the unique triangles:

1. Triangles: [10]
   Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 1>
