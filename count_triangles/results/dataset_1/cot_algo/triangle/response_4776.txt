Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new label for each vertex is as follows:
- Node 3 has 0 connections and is relabeled as 0.
- Nodes 1, 4, and 9 have 1 connection each and are relabeled as 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have 3 connections each and are relabeled as 4 and 5 respectively.
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 4 connections each and are relabeled as 6 and 7 respectively.
- Nodes 0 and 2 have 5 connections each and are relabeled as 8 and 9 respectively.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are 6 triangles in total: [6]
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
