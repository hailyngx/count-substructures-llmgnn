Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1: 1 connections
Node 8: 1 connections
Node 4: 1 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
We start with the edge (1, 2) since Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 2, but these nodes do not share a common neighbor.
Next, we move to the edge (1, 8) since Node 1 has fewer connections than Node 8, but these nodes also do not share a common neighbor.
Then, we check the edge (1, 4) but these nodes do not share a common neighbor.
Moving on to the edge (2, 3), we find a triangle <2, 3, 0>.
Proceeding to the edge (2, 6), we find a triangle <2, 6, 0>.
Checking the edge (3, 0), we find a triangle <3, 0, 6>.
Examining the edge (3, 9), we find a triangle <3, 9, 6>.
Checking the edge (4, 6), we find a triangle <4, 6, 0>.
Examining the edge (5, 0), we find a triangle <5, 0, 6>.
Moving forward to the edge (5, 9), we find a triangle <5, 9, 6>.
Finally, looking at the edge (6, 4), we find a triangle <6, 4, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
