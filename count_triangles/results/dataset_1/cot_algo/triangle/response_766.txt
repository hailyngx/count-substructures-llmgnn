Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 0 has degree 3  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 8 has degree 4  
Node 9 has degree 2  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 0-1-3 <0, 1, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 0-3-4 <0, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
