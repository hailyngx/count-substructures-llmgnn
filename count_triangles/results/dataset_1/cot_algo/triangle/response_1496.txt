Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 0: degree 7

Now, we check each edge starting from the one with the lowest labeled vertex where the vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with 0-6 => <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangles with 0-5 and 0-8 => <0, 5, 6> and <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (0, 8): Already counted with edge (0, 6)
- Edge (0, 9): Forms triangle with 0-6 => <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (1, 2): Forms triangle with 1-9 => <1, 2, 9>
- Edge (1, 9): Forms triangle with 1-2 => <1, 2, 9>
- Edge (2, 4): Already counted with edge (0, 5)
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with 2-9 => <2, 6, 9>
- Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with 2-9 => <2, 8, 9>
- Edge (2, 9): Already counted with edges (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 6), and (2, 8)
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed
- Edge (4, 2): Already counted with edge (0, 5)
- Edge (4, 6): Forms triangle with 2-9 => <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (5, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 5)
- Edge (6, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 6)
- Edge (6, 2): Already counted with edge (0, 5)
- Edge (6, 4): Already counted with edge (0, 5)
- Edge (6, 9): Already counted with edge (0, 6)
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed
- Edge (8, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 6)
- Edge (8, 2): Already counted with edge (2, 8)
- Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed
- Edge (9, 0): Already counted with edge (0, 6), (0, 9), and (1, 9)
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted with edge (1, 9)
- Edge (9, 2): Already counted with edge (1, 2) and (2, 6)
- Edge (9, 6): Already counted with edges (0, 6), (2, 6), and (6, 9)

Thus, the total number of triangles is [5] inside brackets and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, and <2, 8, 9>.
