Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Now, we will check the edges for shared connections between vertices with lower labels:

Checking edges involving Node 0:
- (0, 2): Shared connections with Node 8
- (0, 6): Shared connections with Node 8
- (0, 7): Shared connections with Nodes 4 and 5

Checking edges involving Node 1:
- (1, 4): No further triangles

Checking edges involving Node 2:
- (2, 4): No further triangles

Checking edges involving Node 3:
- (3, 6): No further triangles
- (3, 9): No further triangles

Checking edges involving Node 4:
- (4, 5): Shared connections with Nodes 1 and 7

Checking edges involving Node 5:
- (5, 7): No further triangles

Checking edges involving Node 6:
- (6, 8): Shared connections with Nodes 0 and 8

Checking edges involving Node 7:
- (7, 5): No further triangles

Checking edges involving Node 8:
- (8, 6): No further triangles

There are 5 triangles found in this graph.
The unique triangles are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, and <4, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
