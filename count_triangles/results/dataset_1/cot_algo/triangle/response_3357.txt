Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

We will then label the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Now, we will check for triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 3, results in triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Shared connections with 5, 4, results in triangles <0, 7, 5> and <0, 7, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangles.
4. Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with 4, results in triangle <1, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 4): Shared connection with 3, results in triangle <1, 4, 3>.
6. Edge (2, 4): No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 7): No triangles.
8. Edge (3, 4): No triangles.
9. Edge (3, 9): No triangles.
10. Edge (4, 2): No triangles.
11. Edge (4, 7): Shared connection with 0, results in triangle <4, 7, 0>.
12. Edge (4, 8): No triangles.
13. Edge (5, 7): No triangles.
14. Edge (6, 9): No triangles.
15. Edge (7, 9): No triangles.

The total number of triangles is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 7, 4>, and <4, 7, 0>.
