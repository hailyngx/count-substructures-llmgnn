Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 0
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 0

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 2: Degree 0
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 10: Degree 0
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4

Now, we look at the edges and count the triangles:

- Edge (1, 4): Forms triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles
- Edge (1, 9): Forms triangle <1, 9, 3>
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles
- Edge (3, 9): No triangles
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles
- Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle <4, 8, 6>
- Edge (5, 1): No triangles
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles
- Edge (7, 3): No triangles
- Edge (8, 4): No triangles
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles
- Edge (9, 3): No triangles

Finally, we count the total number of triangles, which is 3, and list the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 9, 3>, <4, 8, 6>
