Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

0: 1, 4
1: 0, 3, 6, 7
3: 1, 4, 5, 8
4: 0, 3, 7, 8
5: 3, 9
6: 1
7: 1, 4
8: 3, 4
9: 5

By sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following list: 6, 9, 0, 7, 8, 5, 4, 3, 1.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we find the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 8>.
