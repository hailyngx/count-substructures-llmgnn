Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following order: 3, 6, 0, 8, 1, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9.

Applying the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

Considering edge (0,5): Both vertices have degree 2. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (1,4): Both vertices have degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (1,5): Vertex 1 has degree 4 and vertex 5 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (1,7): Vertex 1 has degree 4 and vertex 7 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2,4): Vertex 2 has degree 4 and vertex 4 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2,5): Vertex 2 has degree 4 and vertex 5 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2,6): Vertex 2 has degree 4 and vertex 6 has degree 3. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (2,7): Vertex 2 has degree 4 and vertex 7 has degree 4. No triangles are formed.

Considering edge (3,9): Vertex 3 has degree 1 and vertex 9 has degree 5. No triangles are formed.

There are no more edges to consider, and no triangles were formed during the counting process.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
