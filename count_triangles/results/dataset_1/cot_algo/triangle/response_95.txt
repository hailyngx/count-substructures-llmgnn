Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of nodes:  

Node 7: Degree 1  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 2  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 6: Degree 6  
Node 3: Degree 5  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 9: Degree 7  

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the sorted list of nodes to count the triangles.  

Triangles:
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
