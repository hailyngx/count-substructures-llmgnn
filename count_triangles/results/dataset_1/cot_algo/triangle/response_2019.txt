Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree:
0: 3 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 4 connections

Edges to consider based on lower degree node:
(0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (8, 0) (9, 0) (3, 1) (6, 1) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (8, 0) (9, 0)

Calculating the triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 6>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
