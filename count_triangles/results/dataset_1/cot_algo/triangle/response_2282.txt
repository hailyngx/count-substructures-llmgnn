Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted list of vertices is: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles. Starting with the edge between vertices 0 and 3, we continue with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3) - Vertex 0 and Vertex 3 share connections with Vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4) - No triangles.
3. Edge (1, 4) - No triangles.
4. Edge (1, 5) - No triangles.
5. Edge (1, 9) - No triangles.
6. Edge (2, 5) - No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 6) - No triangles.
8. Edge (2, 8) - No triangles.
9. Edge (4, 7) - No triangles.
10. Edge (5, 7) - Vertex 5 and Vertex 7 share connections with Vertex 1, forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
11. Edge (6, 7) - Vertex 7 and Vertex 6 share connections with Vertex 4, forming a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
12. Edge (7, 6) - No triangles.
13. Edge (8, 9) - No triangles.
14. Edge (9, 8) - No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, and <4, 6, 7>.
