Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we assign labels as follows:
Node 1 has 0 connection(s)
Node 6 has 0 connection(s)
Node 8 has 0 connection(s)
Node 4 has 1 connection(s)
Node 5 has 1 connection(s)
Node 3 has 2 connection(s)
Node 9 has 4 connection(s)
Node 0 has 6 connection(s)
Node 2 has 6 connection(s)
Node 7 has 6 connection(s)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices. 

For the edge (0, 2), we check for shared connections. Both 0 and 2 are connected to 9, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.

For the edge (0, 3), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (0, 8), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (0, 9), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (1, 2), we skip this edge since node 1 has fewer connections.

For the edge (2, 1), skip.

For the edge (2, 4), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (2, 9), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (3, 0), skip.

For the edge (3, 5), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (3, 7), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (4, 2), skip.

For the edge (4, 6), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (4, 7), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (5, 3), skip.

For the edge (5, 9), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (6, 4), skip.

For the edge (7, 3), skip.

For the edge (7, 4), skip.

For the edge (7, 8), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (7, 9), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

For the edge (8, 0), skip.

For the edge (8, 7), skip.

For the edge (9, 0), skip.

For the edge (9, 2), skip.

For the edge (9, 5), skip.

For the edge (9, 7), we check for shared connections. No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [1]. The unique triangle found is <0, 2, 9>.
