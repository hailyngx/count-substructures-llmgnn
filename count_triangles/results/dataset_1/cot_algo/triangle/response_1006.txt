Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph proceeds as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 7 and Vertex 9 have 0 connections
   - Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 7, and Vertex 9 have 1 connection
   - Vertex 3 and Vertex 5 have 2 connections
   - Vertex 4 and Vertex 6 have 3 connections
   - Vertex 0 and Vertex 8 have 5 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 7 and Vertex 9 are relabeled as 0 and 1
   - Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 7, and Vertex 9 are relabeled as 2, 3, 4, and 5
   - Vertex 3 and Vertex 5 are relabeled as 6 and 7
   - Vertex 4 and Vertex 6 are relabeled as 8 and 9
   - Vertex 0 and Vertex 8 are relabeled as 10 and 11

3. Traverse each edge following the condition where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - Edge (0, 1) will be processed
     - Shared neighbors of 0 and 1: 6, 7, 8
     - Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>

   - Edge (0, 5) will be processed
     - Shared neighbors of 0 and 5: 6, 8
     - Triangles: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 8>

   - Edge (0, 6) will be processed
     - Shared neighbors of 0 and 6: 4
     - Triangle: <0, 4, 6>

   - Edge (0, 7) will be processed
     - No triangle

   - Edge (0, 8) will be processed
     - Shared neighbors of 0 and 8: 1, 4, 5
     - Triangle: <0, 1, 8>

   - Edge (1, 3) will be processed
     - Shared neighbors of 1 and 3: 4, 8
     - Triangle: <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>

   - Continuing this process for all edges, the total number of triangles found is 9.

Therefore, the output is: [9]
