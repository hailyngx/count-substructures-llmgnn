Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 

Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6

Next, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will consider each edge in the order specified and count the triangles formed by shared connections: 

Triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <1, 7, 9>
