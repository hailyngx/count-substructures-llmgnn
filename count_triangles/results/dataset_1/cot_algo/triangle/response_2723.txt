Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 2: 0 connections
- Vertex 7: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 6 connections
- Vertex 6: 7 connections

Next, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle 4: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <1, 3, 4>
- Triangle 7: <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 10: <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10].
