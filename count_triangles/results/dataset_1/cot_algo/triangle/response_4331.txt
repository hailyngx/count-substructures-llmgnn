Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows: 

Node 3: degree 2

Node 1: degree 1

Node 5: degree 1

Node 2: degree 2

Node 6: degree 3

Node 9: degree 3

Node 7: degree 3

Node 8: degree 4

Node 0: degree 4

Node 4: degree 7

Now, we will identify the triangles:

- For edge (0, 4):
  - Shared connections with 0: 6, 8
  - Triangle: <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>

- For edge (0, 6):
  - Shared connections with 0: 4
  - Triangle: <0, 4, 6>

- For edge (0, 8):
  - Shared connections with 0: 4
  - Triangle: <0, 4, 8>

- For edge (1, 4):
  - No triangle as 1 has fewer connections than 4

- For edge (2, 4):
  - No triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 4

- For edge (2, 6):
  - No triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 6

- For edge (3, 7):
  - No triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 7

- For edge (3, 8):
  - No triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 8

- For edge (4, 7):
  - Shared connections with 4: 0, 8
  - Triangle: <4, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

- For edge (4, 8):
  - Shared connections with 4: 0
  - Triangle: <4, 0, 8>

- For edge (4, 5):
  - No triangle as 5 has fewer connections than 4

- For edge (4, 7):
  - Shared connections with 4: 0, 8
  - Triangle: <4, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

- For edge (4, 8):
  - Shared connections with 4: 0
  - Triangle: <4, 0, 8>

- For edge (5, 4):
  - No triangle as 5 has fewer connections than 4

- For edge (6, 0):
  - Shared connections with 6: 4
  - Triangle: <6, 0, 4>

- For edge (6, 2):
  - No triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 6

- For edge (6, 9):
  - No triangle as 6 has fewer connections than 9 

- For edge (7, 3):
  - No triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 7

- For edge (7, 4):
  - Shared connections with 7: 0, 8
  - Triangle: <7, 0, 4>, <7, 4, 8>

- For edge (7, 9):
  - Shared connections with 7: 8
  - Triangle: <7, 8, 9>

- For edge (8, 0):
  - Shared connections with 8: 4, 0
  - Triangle: <8, 0, 4>

- For edge (8, 3):
  - No triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 8

- For edge (8, 4):
  - Shared connections with 8: 0
  - Triangle: <8, 0, 4>

- For edge (8, 9):
  - Shared connections with 8: 7
  - Triangle: <8, 7, 9>

- For edge (9, 6):
  - No triangle as 6 has fewer connections than 9

- For edge (9, 7):
  - Shared connections with 9: 8
  - Triangle: <9, 8, 7>

- For edge (9, 8):
  - Shared connections with 9: 7
  - Triangle: <9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <4, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 0, 8>, <6, 0, 4>, <7, 0, 4>, <7, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 7, 9>, <9, 8, 7>, <9, 7, 8>.
