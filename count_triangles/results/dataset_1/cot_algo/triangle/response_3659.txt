Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 3 (Degree: 4)
Node 4 (Degree: 4)
Node 5 (Degree: 3)
Node 8 (Degree: 2)
Node 9 (Degree: 2)
Node 1 (Degree: 3)
Node 7 (Degree: 3)
Node 2 (Degree: 5)
Node 6 (Degree: 6)
Node 0 (Degree: 5)

Now, let's find the triangles based on the instructions provided:
- For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [12]
