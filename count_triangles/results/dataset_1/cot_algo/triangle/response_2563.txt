Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:  

Number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 5, 7>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 7>
