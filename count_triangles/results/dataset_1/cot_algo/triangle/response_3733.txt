Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 2 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 1 connections
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 0 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 4 connections
Node 5 -> 4 connections
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 4 -> 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<6, 0, 1>
<9, 4, 0>
<5, 2, 1>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
