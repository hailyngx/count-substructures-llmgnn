Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Vertices sorted by degree (number of connections): 
  - Node 1: degree 1
  - Node 3: degree 1
  - Node 5: degree 1
  - Node 6: degree 2  
  - Node 2: degree 3
  - Node 4: degree 4
  - Node 8: degree 4
  - Node 0: degree 5
  - Node 9: degree 6
  - Node 7: degree 6

- Based on the given edges and the sorted degree list, we proceed to count the triangles:
  - Triangle 1: <0, 5, 7>
  - Triangle 2: <0, 7, 8>
  - Triangle 3: <0, 7, 9>
  - Triangle 4: <1, 9, 4> 
  - Triangle 5: <2, 3, 7>
  - Triangle 6: <2, 7, 4>
  - Triangle 7: <4, 7, 9>
  - Triangle 8: <6, 8, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 8]
