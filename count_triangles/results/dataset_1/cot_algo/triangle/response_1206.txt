Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
Node 0: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 6
Node 1: Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge: (0, 1) (Node 0 and Node 1)
   Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

2. Edge: (3, 5) (Node 3 and Node 5)
   Triangle: <3, 5, 7>

3. Edge: (6, 7) (Node 6 and Node 7)
   Triangles: <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>

4. Edge: (9, 8) (Node 8 and Node 9)
   Triangle: <1, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
