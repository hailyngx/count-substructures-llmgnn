Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: (7, 0, 5, 2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 3). 

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 1): 
    - Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 1 has 3 connections. Since 0 < 1 and 0 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (0, 7): 
    - Vertex 0 has 2 connections and vertex 7 has 3 connections. Since 0 < 7 and 0 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (1, 2): 
    - Vertex 1 has 3 connections and vertex 2 has 3 connections. Since 1 < 2 and 1 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (2, 4): 
    - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and vertex 4 has 3 connections. Since 2 < 4 and 2 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: 3

- For edge (2, 6): 
    - Vertex 2 has 3 connections and vertex 6 has 3 connections. Since 2 < 6 and 2 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (3, 4): 
    - Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 4 has 3 connections. Since 4 < 3 and 4 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: 2

- For edge (3, 6): 
    - Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 6 has 3 connections. Since 6 < 3 and 6 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (3, 7): 
    - Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 7 has 3 connections. Since 7 < 3 and 7 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: 0

- For edge (3, 9): 
    - Vertex 3 has 5 connections and vertex 9 has 2 connections. Since 9 < 3 and 9 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (4, 5): 
    - Vertex 4 has 3 connections and vertex 5 has 1 connection. Since 5 < 4 and 5 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None

- For edge (7, 9): 
    - Vertex 7 has 3 connections and vertex 9 has 2 connections. Since 9 < 7 and 9 has fewer connections, we check for shared connections.
    - Shared connections: None
