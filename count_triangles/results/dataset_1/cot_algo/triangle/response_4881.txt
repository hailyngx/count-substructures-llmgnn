Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Based on this ordering, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
1. (1, 3): Shared connections with 0 and 2 forming the triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. (1, 7): Shared connection with 4 forming the triangle <1, 4, 7>.
3. (1, 8): No triangles.
4. (1, 9): Shared connection with 2 forming the triangle <1, 2, 9>.
5. (2, 3): Shared connection with 0 and 1 forming the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
6. (2, 9): Shared connection with 1 forming the triangle <1, 2, 9>.
7. (3, 6): No triangles.
8. (3, 8): No triangles.
9. (4, 6): No triangles.
10. (4, 7): No triangles.
11. (5, 7): No triangles.
12. (6, 7): Shared connection with 1 and 4 forming the triangle <1, 4, 6>.
13. (8, 9): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
