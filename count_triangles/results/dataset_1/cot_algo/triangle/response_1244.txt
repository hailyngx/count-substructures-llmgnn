Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree, i.e., the number of connections they have. Here is the sorted list of vertices:
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertices 9 and 8 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 6 and 2 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 5 and 1 have 4 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 4 have 5 connections each.
Vertices 7 has 6 connections.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Starting with the edge (0, 1):
- Vertices 0 and 1 both have 5 connections.
- They share connections with vertices 2, 4, 6, and 8, forming 4 triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 4>.

Moving on to the edge (0, 2):
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections.
- Vertices 0 and 2 share connections with vertices 4 and 5, forming 2 triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>.

Considering the edge (0, 4):
- Vertex 4 has 5 connections.
- Vertices 0 and 4 share connections with vertices 7, forming 1 triangle: <0, 4, 7>.

For edge (1, 6):
- Vertices 1 and 6 share connections with vertices 8, forming 1 triangle: <1, 6, 8>.

Checking the edge (2, 5):
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
- Vertices 2 and 5 share connections with vertex 7, forming 1 triangle: <2, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 7>.
