Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 1 : 3 connections
Node 2 : 2 connections
Node 3 : 3 connections
Node 4 : 3 connections
Node 5 : 6 connections
Node 6 : 1 connection
Node 7 : 5 connections
Node 8 : 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 6 : 1 connection
Node 8 : 1 connection
Node 2 : 2 connections
Node 1 : 3 connections
Node 3 : 3 connections
Node 4 : 3 connections
Node 7 : 5 connections
Node 5 : 6 connections

Next, we will identify triangles based on the given edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
For edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
For edge (1, 8): No triangle.
For edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 7 forming a triangle <2, 5, 7>.
For edge (2, 7): No triangle.
For edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 7 forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
For edge (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 5 forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
For edge (4, 5): Node 4 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 7 forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>.
For edge (5, 6): No triangle.
For edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 2 forming a triangle <2, 5, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [5].
