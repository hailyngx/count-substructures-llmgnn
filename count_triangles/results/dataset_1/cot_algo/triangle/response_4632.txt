Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degrees of each vertex based on the given edges:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

Next, we sort the nodes based on their degrees (in ascending order): 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 3, 8, 5

Now, let's analyze the edges, considering only the edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Triangles can be formed by shared connections. Here's a list of unique triangles found:
- <1, 5, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <0, 5, 9>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
