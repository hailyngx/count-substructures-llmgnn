Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices in increasing order of connections:
0: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
9: 1 connection
7: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices in the sorted order: 
5 -> 0
9 -> 1
2 -> 2
6 -> 3
8 -> 4
0 -> 5
7 -> 6

Next, we will check the edges based on the vertex labels and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 6, 7>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <0, 7, 8>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <7, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
