Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
```
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
```

Analyzing the given edges based on the above labeling:
1. (0, 1): No triangle can be formed.
2. (0, 3): Triangle formed: <0, 3, 7>
3. (0, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>
4. (1, 0): No triangle can be formed.
5. (1, 4): No triangle can be formed.
6. (2, 4): No triangle can be formed.
7. (2, 6): No triangle can be formed.
8. (2, 7): Triangle formed: <2, 7, 3>
9. (3, 0): Triangle formed: <3, 0, 4>
10. (3, 7): Triangle formed: <3, 7, 2>
11. (3, 9): Triangle formed: <3, 9, 4>
12. (4, 0): Triangle formed: <4, 0, 3>
13. (4, 1): No triangle can be formed.
14. (4, 2): Triangle formed: <4, 2, 7>
15. (4, 8): Triangle formed: <4, 8, 7>
16. (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 9, 3>
17. (5, 9): No triangle can be formed.
18. (6, 2): No triangle can be formed.
19. (7, 2): Triangle formed: <7, 2, 4>
20. (7, 3): Triangle formed: <7, 3, 0>
21. (7, 8): Triangle formed: <7, 8, 4>
22. (8, 4): No triangle can be formed.
23. (8, 7): Triangle formed: <8, 7, 2>
24. (9, 3): Triangle formed: <9, 3, 0>
25. (9, 4): Triangle formed: <9, 4, 0>
26. (9, 5): No triangle can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <2, 7, 3>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 2, 7>, <4, 8, 7>, <4, 9, 3>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 3, 0>, <7, 8, 4>, <8, 7, 2>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 4, 0>.
