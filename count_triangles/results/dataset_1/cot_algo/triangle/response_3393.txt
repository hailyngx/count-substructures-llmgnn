Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order. Then we relabel the vertices based on this order. 

The sorted vertices and their corresponding degrees are as follows:
Node 3: 0 edges
Node 0: 1 edge
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 8: 5 edges

We will now count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

- (0, 8): None
- (1, 2): None
- (1, 5): None
- (1, 6): None
- (1, 8): None
- (2, 5): None
- (2, 7): None
- (2, 9): None
- (4, 6): None
- (4, 8): None
- (5, 6): <1, 5, 6>
- (5, 8): <1, 5, 8>
- (5, 9): <2, 5, 9>
- (6, 8): <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
