Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 

Nodes by degree: (1) 1, 7; (2) 4, 5, 6; (3) 8, 9; (4) 0. 

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given edges:

1. (0, 4): 0 is connected to 4. Nodes 4 and 0 share 5, which forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
2. (0, 6): 0 is connected to 6. No triangle formed.
3. (0, 9): 0 is connected to 9. No triangle formed.
4. (1, 8): 1 and 8 have no common neighbor. No triangle formed.
5. (4, 0): Already counted in step 1.
6. (4, 5): Already counted in step 1.
7. (5, 4): Already counted in step 1.
8. (5, 8): 5 is connected to 8. Nodes 5 and 8 share 4. Triangle <5, 8, 4>.
9. (6, 0): Already checked in step 2.
10. (7, 9): 7 is connected to 9. No triangle formed.
11. (8, 1): Already checked in step 4.
12. (8, 5): Already counted in step 8.
13. (8, 9): 8 is connected to 9. Nodes 8 and 9 share 0, which forms triangle <8, 9, 0>.
14. (9, 0): Already checked in step 3.
15. (9, 7): Already checked in step 10.
16. (9, 8): Already counted in step 13.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5> and <8, 9, 0>.
