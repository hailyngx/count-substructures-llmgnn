Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on their degree of connections. Here is the list of vertices in ascending order of their connections:

Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:

<0, 4, 1>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<4, 6, 0>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 5, 0>
<5, 7, 8>
<8, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
