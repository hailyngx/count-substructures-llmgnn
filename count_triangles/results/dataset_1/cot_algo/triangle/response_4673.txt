Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the graph is as follows: 

Vertices: 1, 7, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4

Now, we can proceed to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

We start with the edge (0, 2) since vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 2. Looking at the shared connections, we find a triangle with vertex 2, 0, and 3. 
Moving to the edge (0, 3), we find another triangle with vertex 3, 0, and 4. 
The edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 4, 0, and 9. 
The edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 3, 2, and 5. 
The edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 8, 5, and 0. 
The edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle. 
The edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [4]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
