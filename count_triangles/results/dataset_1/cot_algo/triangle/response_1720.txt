Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1 -> Node 0
Node 5 -> Node 1
Node 0 -> Node 2
Node 6 -> Node 3
Node 9 -> Node 4
Node 2 -> Node 5
Node 7 -> Node 6
Node 8 -> Node 7
Node 4 -> Node 8
Node 3 -> Node 9

Next, we will count the triangles:
- Node 0 and Node 6 share Node 7, forming triangle <0, 6, 7>.
- Node 0 and Node 6 also share Node 8, forming triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Node 0 and Node 7 share Node 8, forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
- Node 2 and Node 3 share Node 8, forming triangle <2, 3, 8>.
- Node 5 and Node 3 share Node 6, forming triangle <5, 3, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
