Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 1: 1 connections  
Node 7: 1 connections  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:

For edge (0, 5):
- Node 0 and Node 5 share connections with Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 5>.

For edge (1, 8):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (2, 4):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (2, 5):
- Node 2 and Node 5 share connections with Node 0, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 5>.

For edge (2, 8):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (2, 9):
- Node 2 and Node 9 share connections with Nodes 3 and 6, forming triangles: <2, 3, 9> and <2, 6, 9>.

For edge (3, 4):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (3, 6):
- Node 3 and Node 6 share connections with Nodes 2 and 9, forming triangles: <2, 3, 6> and <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (3, 9):
- Node 3 and Node 9 share connections with Nodes 2 and 6, forming a triangle: <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (4, 2):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (4, 3):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (5, 0):
- Node 5 and Node 0 share connections with Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 5>.

For edge (5, 2):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (5, 7):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (5, 9):
- Node 5 and Node 9 share connections with Nodes 2, 3, and 6, forming triangles: <2, 3, 5>, <5, 6, 9>, and <2, 5, 9>.

For edge (6, 3):
- Node 6 and Node 3 share connections with Nodes 2 and 9, forming triangles: <2, 3, 6> and <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (6, 8):
- Node 6 and Node 8 share connections with Node 2, forming a triangle: <2, 6, 8>.

For edge (6, 9):
- Node 6 and Node 9 share connections with Nodes 2 and 3, forming triangles: <2, 3, 6> and <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (7, 5):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (8, 1):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (8, 2):
- No triangles are formed.

For edge (8, 6):
- Node 8 and Node 6 share connections with Node 2, forming a triangle: <2, 6, 8>.

For edge (9, 2):
- Node 9 and Node 2 share connections with Nodes 3 and 6, forming triangles: <2, 3, 9> and <2, 6, 9>.

For edge (9, 3):
- Node 9 and Node 3 share connections with Nodes 2 and 6, forming a triangle: <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (9, 5):
- Node 9 and Node 5 share connections with Nodes 2, 3, and 6, forming triangles: <2, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, and <2, 5, 9>.

For edge (9, 6):
- Node 9 and Node 6 share connections with Nodes 2 and 3, forming triangles: <2, 3, 9> and <3, 6, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [13] inside brackets.
