Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Starting with the Degree-Based Ordering method:  
Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 0 connections.  
Node 2 has 3 connections.  
Node 3 has 3 connections.  
Node 4 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 2 connections.  
Node 6 has 3 connections.  
Node 7 has 3 connections.  
Node 8 has 1 connection.  
Node 9 has 3 connections.  

The sorted labels are:  
Node 1 with label 0.  
Node 8 with label 1.  
Node 0 with label 2.  
Node 4 with label 3.  
Node 5 with label 4.  
Node 2 with label 5.  
Node 6 with label 6.  
Node 7 with label 7.  
Node 3 with label 8.  
Node 9 with label 9.  

Now, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
Edge (0, 5): Both nodes have 2 common connections (9 and 0), resulting in a triangle.  
Edge (0, 9): Both nodes have 2 common connections (5 and 2), resulting in a triangle.  
Edge (2, 3): Both nodes have 1 common connection (6), forming a triangle.  
Edge (2, 6): Both nodes have 1 common connection (3), forming a triangle.  
Edge (3, 6): Both nodes have 3 common connections (2, 7, and 6), forming a triangle.  
Edge (3, 7): Both nodes have 1 common connection (6), forming a triangle.  
Edge (4, 7): Both nodes have 1 common connection (6), forming a triangle.  
Edge (5, 9): Both nodes have 2 common connections (0 and 2), forming a triangle.  
Edge (6, 7): Both nodes have 2 common connections (3 and 4), forming a triangle.  
Edge (7, 4): Both nodes have 1 common connection (8), forming a triangle.  
Edge (9, 5): Both nodes have 2 common connections (0 and 2), forming a triangle.  

Counting the triangles generated, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].  
Unique triangles found are:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 6, 7>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<5, 9, 0>  
<3, 6, 7>  
<3, 6, 2>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<9, 5, 0>
