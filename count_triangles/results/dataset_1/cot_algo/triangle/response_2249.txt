Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

Sorted vertices: 
1. Node 1: 1 connection
2. Node 2: 1 connection
3. Node 7: 1 connection
4. Node 5: 2 connections
5. Node 8: 2 connections
6. Node 6: 2 connections
7. Node 4: 3 connections
8. Node 3: 4 connections
9. Node 9: 5 connections
10. Node 0: 5 connections

Next, we will check each edge starting from the node with the lower label to count the number of triangles:
1. (0, 4): Check connections of node 0 (4, 6, 8, 9) and node 4 (0, 3). Shared connection: 0, 3. Triangle found: <0, 3, 4>.
2. (0, 6): Check connections of node 0 (4, 6, 8, 9) and node 6 (0, 2). Shared connection: 0. No triangle formed.
3. (0, 8): Check connections of node 0 (4, 6, 8, 9) and node 8 (0, 5). Shared connection: 0. No triangle formed.
4. (0, 9): Check connections of node 0 (4, 6, 8, 9) and node 9 (0, 3, 5, 7). Shared connections: 0, 3. Triangle found: <0, 3, 9>.
5. (1, 3): Check connections of node 1 (3) and node 3 (1, 4, 9). Shared connection: 1. No triangle formed.
6. (2, 6): Check connections of node 2 (6) and node 6 (0, 2). Shared connection: 2. No triangle formed.
7. (3, 1): Proceeding from node 1. Already checked.
8. (3, 4): Proceeding from node 3. Already checked.
9. (3, 9): Proceeding from node 3. Already checked.
10. (4, 0): Proceeding from node 0. Already checked.
11. (4, 3): Proceeding from node 3. Already checked.
12. (5, 8): Check connections of node 5 (0, 9, 8) and node 8 (0, 5). Shared connection: 5, 8. Triangle found: <5, 8, 0>.
13. (5, 9): Check connections of node 5 (0, 9, 8) and node 9 (0, 3, 5, 7). Shared connection: 5, 9. Triangle found: <5, 9, 0>.
14. (6, 0): Proceeding from node 0. Already checked.
15. (6, 2): Proceeding from node 2. Already checked.
16. (7, 9): Check connections of node 7 (9) and node 9 (0, 3, 5, 7). Shared connection: 9. No triangle formed.
17. (8, 0): Proceeding from node 0. Already checked.
18. (8, 5): Proceeding from node 5. Already checked.
19. (9, 0): Proceeding from node 0. Already checked.
20. (9, 3): Proceeding from node 3. Already checked.
21. (9, 5): Proceeding from node 5. Already checked.
22. (9, 7): Proceeding from node 7. Already checked.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <5, 8, 0>
