Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices with their connections:
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 4 connections

Sorted vertices:
1 < 6 < 0 < 4 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 2 < 3 < 5

Using the sorted vertices list, we will analyze each edge to count the triangles:

1. (1, 4): No triangles
2. (6, 2): No triangles
3. (0, 2): <0, 2, 3>
4. (4, 1): No triangles
5. (7, 4): <4, 7, 8>
6. (0, 3): <0, 3, 9>
7. (2, 0): No triangles
8. (3, 0): No triangles
9. (5, 0): <0, 5, 7>
10. (4, 8): No triangles
11. (5, 7): No triangles
12. (2, 6): No triangles
13. (3, 6): No triangles
14. (7, 5): No triangles
15. (3, 8): No triangles
16. (5, 8): <5, 8, 4>
17. (8, 3): <8, 3, 9>
18. (5, 9): No triangles
19. (7, 8): No triangles
20. (8, 4): No triangles
21. (3, 9): No triangles
22. (8, 5): <8, 5, 0>
23. (5, 9): <5, 9, 3>

Total number of triangles: [6]
