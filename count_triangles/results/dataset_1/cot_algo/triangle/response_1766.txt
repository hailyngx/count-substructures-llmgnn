Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each vertex after counting the connections:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now we will sort the nodes by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them accordingly:
- Node 1: 1 connection (now labeled as 0)
- Node 2: 1 connection (now labeled as 1)
- Node 5: 1 connection (now labeled as 2)
- Node 9: 2 connections (now labeled as 3)
- Node 0: 3 connections (now labeled as 4)
- Node 7: 3 connections (now labeled as 5)
- Node 6: 4 connections (now labeled as 6)
- Node 8: 4 connections (now labeled as 7)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
1. <0, 6, 7>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
