Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Node 3: 0 connections
- Node 1, 8: 1 connection each
- Node 4, 9: 2 connections each
- Node 2, 5: 3 connections each
- Node 0, 7: 4 connections each
- Node 6: 5 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 3: 0 connections -> relabeled as Node 0
- Node 1, 8: 1 connection each -> relabeled as Node 1, Node 2
- Node 4, 9: 2 connections each -> relabeled as Node 3, Node 4
- Node 2, 5: 3 connections each -> relabeled as Node 5, Node 6
- Node 0, 7: 4 connections each -> relabeled as Node 7, Node 8
- Node 6: 5 connections -> relabeled as Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- (0, 1) & (0, 7): Shared connection with Node 1 forms a triangle <0, 1, 7>
- (1, 0): No triangle formed
- (2, 5) & (2, 9): Shared connection with Node 9 forms a triangle <2, 5, 9>
- (4, 5) & (4, 7): Shared connection with Node 5 forms a triangle <4, 5, 7>
- (5, 2): No triangle formed
- (5, 4): No triangle formed
- (5, 6): No triangle formed
- (6, 5) & (6, 7) & (6, 8) & (6, 9): Shared connections with Nodes 5, 7, and 9 form triangles <6, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9>
- (6, 7): No triangle formed
- (6, 8): No triangle formed
- (6, 9): No triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 5, 9>.
