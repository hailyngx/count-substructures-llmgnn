Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 3 (1 connection) -> Node 0
- Node 4 (1 connection) -> Node 1
- Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node 2
- Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 3
- Node 6 (2 connections) -> Node 4
- Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 5
- Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 6
- Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 7
- Node 0 (5 connections) -> Node 8

Now, we will list the edges in the sorted order:
- (3, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (2, 0)
- (3, 5)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 0)
- (6, 5)
- (7, 0)
- (4, 7)
- (5, 6)
- (6, 7)
- (7, 8)
- (9, 0)
- (6, 8)
- (8, 0)
- (9, 8)
- (7, 9)
- (7, 1)
- (8, 1)
- (8, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles by examining shared connections between vertices with lower labels in each edge:
- <3, 0, 5>
- <4, 1, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [6].
