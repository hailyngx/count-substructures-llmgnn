Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 4, 5, 0, 8, 5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 9.

Now, let's count the triangles:

For edge (0, 7):
- (0, 7) shares connections with 1 and 2 -> triangle <0, 1, 2>.

For edge (1, 2):
- (1, 2) shares connection with 3 -> triangle <1, 2, 3>.

For edge (1, 3):
- (1, 3) shares connection with 2 -> triangle <1, 2, 3>.

For edge (1, 7):
- (1, 7) shares connections with 0, 2, 5 -> triangles <1, 0, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, and <1, 5, 7>.

For edge (2, 3):
- (2, 3) shares connections with 1 -> triangle <1, 2, 3>.

For edge (2, 7):
- (2, 7) shares connections with 1 -> triangle <1, 2, 7>.

For edge (3, 6):
- (3, 6) doesn't form a triangle because 6 has a lower degree than 3.

For edge (3, 9):
- (3, 9) shares connections with 6 -> triangle <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (4, 9):
- (4, 9) doesn't form a triangle because 4 has a lower degree than 9.

For edge (5, 7):
- (5, 7) doesn't form a triangle because 5 has a lower degree than 7.

For edge (6, 9):
- (6, 9) shares connections with 3 -> triangle <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (7, 0):
- (7, 0) shares connections with 1 and 2 -> triangle <0, 1, 2>.

For edge (7, 1):
- (7, 1) shares connections with 2 and 5 -> triangles <1, 2, 7> and <1, 5, 7>.

For edge (7, 2):
- (7, 2) shares connection with 1 -> triangle <1, 2, 7>.

For edge (7, 5):
- (7, 5) doesn't form a triangle because 5 has a lower degree than 7.

For edge (7, 8):
- (7, 8) doesn't form a triangle because 8 has a lower degree than 7.

For edge (8, 7):
- (8, 7) doesn't form a triangle because 8 has a lower degree than 7.

For edge (8, 9):
- (8, 9) doesn't form a triangle because 8 has a lower degree than 9.

For edge (9, 3):
- (9, 3) shares connections with 6 -> triangle <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (9, 4):
- (9, 4) doesn't form a triangle because 4 has a lower degree than 9.

For edge (9, 6):
- (9, 6) shares connections with 3 -> triangle <3, 6, 9>.

For edge (9, 8):
- (9, 8) doesn't form a triangle because 8 has a lower degree than 9.

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 9>
