Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling vertices accordingly, the sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 

Vertex 2 -> Degree: 1
Vertex 3 -> Degree: 1
Vertex 7 -> Degree: 1
Vertex 8 -> Degree: 1
Vertex 4 -> Degree: 2
Vertex 5 -> Degree: 2
Vertex 7 -> Degree: 2
Vertex 8 -> Degree: 2
Vertex 6 -> Degree: 3
Vertex 9 -> Degree: 5

Now, we will count the triangles by looking at the edges with the vertex with the lowest label and fewer connections. The triangles found are:

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
