Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's label the vertices according to their degrees in increasing order:
Vertices: 1(2), 5(2), 8(2), 0(3), 6(3), 9(3), 3(4), 4(4), 7(4), 2(4)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 3
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 2
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 3
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connections with 3
- Edge (2, 9): Shared connections with 7
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 0 and 2
- Edge (3, 6): Shared connections with 0
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 6>
