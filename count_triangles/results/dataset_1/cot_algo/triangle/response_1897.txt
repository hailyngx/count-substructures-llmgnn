Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the nodes becomes: 

Nodes: 2, 4, 8, 0, 7, 5, 9, 1, 6, 3

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

From the given edges, we can see that the following triangles are formed: 

<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 3>
<2, 1, 3>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 9, 3>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 3, 0>
<6, 3, 1>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 5, 2>
<7, 4, 6>
<9, 3, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
