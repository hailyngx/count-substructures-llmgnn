Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. 
Here is the sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections:
Nodes: 2, 6, 4, 8, 5, 7, 3, 1

Using this ordering, we analyze each edge based on the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This way, each triangle is counted only once.

From the provided edges, we identify the following triangles:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
