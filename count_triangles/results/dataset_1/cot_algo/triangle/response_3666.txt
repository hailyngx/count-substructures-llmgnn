Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, which are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 1
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 5

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following new labels:
Vertex 0 (degree 1) -> New label 0
Vertex 2 (degree 2) -> New label 1
Vertex 3 (degree 2) -> New label 2
Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> New label 3
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> New label 4
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> New label 5
Vertex 1 (degree 5) -> New label 6
Vertex 4 (degree 5) -> New label 7
Vertex 9 (degree 5) -> New label 8

Using the new labels, we can analyze the edges to count the number of triangles. Calculating this shows there are 9 triangles in the given graph with the unique triangles being:
<1, 7, 4>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<3, 9, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 9>

Therefore, the output will be:
[9]
