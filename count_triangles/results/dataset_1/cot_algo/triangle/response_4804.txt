Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
```
1: 9
2: 2
3: 2
4: 2
5: 4
6: 6
7: 3
8: 5
9: 1
0: 4
```

Count of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <0, 8, 5>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 0>, <2, 8, 0>, <3, 8, 0>, <4, 8, 0>, <5, 8, 6>, <5, 6, 0>
