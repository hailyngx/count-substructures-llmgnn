Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on the number of connections in ascending order: 
Vertices: 0[2], 7[2], 1[2], 9[2], 5[3], 6[3], 2[3], 4[4], 8[5], 3[5]

After relabeling the vertices, the edges are processed according to the method described. The total number of triangles identified is 7, and they are listed below:
