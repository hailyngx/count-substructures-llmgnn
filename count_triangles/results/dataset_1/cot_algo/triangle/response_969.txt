Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 1 has degree 1
Vertex 5 has degree 1
Vertex 7 has degree 1
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 9 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 6 has degree 4
Vertex 2 has degree 4

Now, we will consider the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

1. (1, 8) - Proceed
2. (5, 3) - Proceed
3. (7, 6) - Proceed
4. (0, 4) - Proceed
5. (1, 8) shares connection with 8, forming triangle <1, 8, 0>.
6. (5, 3) shares connection with 3, forming triangle <5, 3, 2>.
7. (7, 6) shares connection with 6, forming triangle <7, 6, 8>.
8. (0, 4) shares connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 4, 6>.

Calculating the total number of triangles: [3]
