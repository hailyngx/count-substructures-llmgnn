Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are labeled as follows based on the number of connections:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Based on the sorted labels, the edges to check for triangles are:
(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (8, 7), (9, 7)

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Shared connections between (0, 2) are 8 and 7 forming triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Shared connections between (0, 7) are 8 forming triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Shared connections between (1, 3) are 4 forming triangle <1, 3, 4>
- Shared connections between (2, 3) are 4, 7 and 8 forming triangles <2, 3, 4> and <2, 3, 7>
- Shared connections between (3, 4) are 1, 2 and 7 forming triangles <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4> and <3, 4, 7>
- Shared connections between (6, 7) are 9 forming triangle <6, 7, 9>
- Shared connections between (6, 8) are 7 forming triangle <6, 8, 7>
- Shared connections between (8, 7) are 6 forming triangle <6, 8, 7>

There are a total of [8] triangles in the given graph.
