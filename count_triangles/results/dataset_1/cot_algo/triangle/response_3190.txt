Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree.

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (Degree: 3)
1 (Degree: 3)
4 (Degree: 2)
5 (Degree: 2)
8 (Degree: 2)
7 (Degree: 2)
2 (Degree: 2)
9 (Degree: 5)
6 (Degree: 6)
3 (Degree: 4)

With the vertices relabeled accordingly:
0 (New Label: 0)
1 (New Label: 1)
4 (New Label: 2)
5 (New Label: 3)
8 (New Label: 4)
7 (New Label: 5)
2 (New Label: 6)
9 (New Label: 7)
6 (New Label: 8)
3 (New Label: 9)

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 6, 3>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 7>
