Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeling is as follows:
- Node 7: 0 connections
- Node 9: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 3, 6>
4. <1, 2, 5>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <1, 4, 9>
8. <2, 4, 8>
9. <2, 5, 6>
10. <4, 5, 8>
11. <4, 5, 9>
12. <5, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
