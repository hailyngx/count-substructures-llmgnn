Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 3>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [12].
