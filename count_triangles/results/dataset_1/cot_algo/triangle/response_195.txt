Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 0 and Node 5: 2 connections
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 8 and Node 3: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1: A
Node 0 and Node 5: B
Node 3: C
Node 8: D
Node 9: E
Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7: F
Node 6: G

Now, we will check the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- (0, 8): Not considered since both have the same number of connections.
- (1, 6): Not considered since both have the same number of connections.
- (2, 6): Considered.
- (2, 7): Considered.
- (2, 8): Not considered since (2, 8) has both vertices with the same number of connections.
- (4, 6): Considered.
- (4, 7): Considered.
- (4, 9): Not considered since both have the same number of connections.
- (5, 6): Not considered since both have the same number of connections.
- (6, 1): Not considered since Node 1 has fewer connections.
- (6, 2): Not considered since Node 2 has more connections.
- (6, 4): Considered.
- (6, 5): Not considered since Node 5 has fewer connections.
- (6, 7): Considered.
- (7, 2): Considered.
- (7, 4): Considered.
- (7, 9): Not considered since Node 9 has more connections.
- (8, 0): Considered.
- (8, 2): Not considered since Node 2 has more connections.
- (8, 9): Not considered since Node 9 has more connections.
- (9, 4): Not considered since Node 4 has more connections.
- (9, 7): Not considered since Node 7 has more connections.

The total number of triangles is found to be 4.

The unique triangles are <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, and <0, 8, 2>. 

So, the total number of triangles is [4].
