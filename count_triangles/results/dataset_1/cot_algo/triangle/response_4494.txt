Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles follows the steps below:

Step 1: Sort vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order.
        The sorted list of vertices: [3, 6, 8, 5, 4, 2, 7, 9, 1, 0]

Step 2: Relabel the vertices based on the sorted list.
        New labels: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9}

Step 3: Count the triangles formed by the edges while considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.
        Triangles found: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 9, 5>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
