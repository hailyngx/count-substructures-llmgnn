Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Vertex 8: 0 connections
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

- Vertex 8 -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 0 -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 5 -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 7 -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 6 -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 9 -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 1 -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 3 -> Vertex 9

Next, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 2): No triangle
- For edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- For edge (1, 6): No triangle
- For edge (1, 7): No triangle
- For edge (1, 9): No triangle
- For edge (2, 0): No triangle
- For edge (2, 3): No triangle
- For edge (2, 4): No triangle
- For edge (3, 1): Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- For edge (3, 2): No triangle
- For edge (3, 4): Triangle <1, 3, 7> and Triangle <3, 4, 2>
- For edge (3, 5): No triangle
- For edge (3, 7): No triangle
- For edge (4, 2): No triangle
- For edge (4, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 2>
- For edge (5, 3): No triangle
- For edge (6, 1): No triangle
- For edge (6, 9): No triangle
- For edge (7, 1): No triangle
- For edge (7, 3): No triangle
- For edge (9, 1): No triangle
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7> and <3, 4, 2>.
