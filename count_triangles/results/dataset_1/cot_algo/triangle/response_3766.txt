Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After reordering the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 6 (degree 2)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 3 (degree 5)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 4 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph by examining each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles:

- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 4, 7>
- Triangle <1, 7, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
