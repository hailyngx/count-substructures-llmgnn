Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Check connections of 0 and 2 for shared connections.
2. Edge (1, 6): Not considered as 1 and 6 don't have fewer connections than the other.
3. Edge (2, 7): Not considered as 2 and 7 don't have fewer connections than the other.
4. Edge (2, 9): Check connections of 2 and 9 for shared connections.
5. Edge (3, 5): Not considered as 5 has fewer connections than 3.
6. Edge (3, 6): Check connections of 3 and 6 for shared connections.
7. Edge (3, 7): Check connections of 3 and 7 for shared connections.
8. Edge (3, 9): Check connections of 3 and 9 for shared connections.
9. Edge (5, 3): Not considered as 5 has fewer connections than 3.
10. Edge (6, 1): Not considered as 1 has fewer connections than 6.
11. Edge (6, 3): Check connections of 6 and 3 for shared connections.
12. Edge (6, 7): Check connections of 6 and 7 for shared connections.
13. Edge (6, 8): Check connections of 6 and 8 for shared connections.
14. Edge (7, 2): Not considered as 2 has fewer connections than 7.
15. Edge (7, 3): Check connections of 7 and 3 for shared connections.
16. Edge (7, 6): Check connections of 7 and 6 for shared connections.
17. Edge (7, 9): Check connections of 7 and 9 for shared connections.
18. Edge (8, 6): Check connections of 8 and 6 for shared connections.
19. Edge (8, 9): Check connections of 8 and 9 for shared connections.
20. Edge (9, 2): Not considered as 2 has fewer connections than 9.
21. Edge (9, 3): Check connections of 9 and 3 for shared connections.
22. Edge (9, 7): Check connections of 9 and 7 for shared connections.
23. Edge (9, 8): Check connections of 9 and 8 for shared connections.
