Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 7 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 2), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9)

After considering the above edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
