Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, we can see that the (0, 2) edge qualifies for counting triangles since the vertex with the lower label (0) has fewer connections. The shared connections of vertices 0 and 2 are 3 and 2, which forms triangles with vertices 3 and 5. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3> and <0, 2, 5>.
