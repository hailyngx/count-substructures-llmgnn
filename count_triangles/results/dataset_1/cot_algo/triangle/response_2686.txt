Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0: 4 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, and <4, 6, 9>.
