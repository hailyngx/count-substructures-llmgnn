Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Node 0 (1 connection) is connected to Node 2 (5 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 4 (4 connections): <0, 2, 4>
- Node 3 (2 connections) is connected to Node 4 (4 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 7 (2 connections): <3, 4, 7>
- Node 2 (5 connections) is connected to Node 4 (4 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 9 (5 connections): <2, 4, 9>
- Node 2 (5 connections) is connected to Node 5 (2 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 8 (1 connection): <2, 5, 8>
- Node 2 (5 connections) is connected to Node 9 (5 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 7 (2 connections): <2, 7, 9>
- Node 4 (4 connections) is connected to Node 9 (5 connections) which forms a triangle with Node 9 (5 connections): <4, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [5]
