Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

Vertices: 2, 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 0

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:

2 → 0
9 → 1
4 → 2
6 → 3
1 → 4
3 → 5
5 → 6
7 → 7
8 → 8
0 → 9

The edges in the updated numbering are as follows:
(9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (2, 3) (6, 9) (3, 2) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 1) (1, 8)

Now we will check for triangles formed by shared connections:
Triangles:
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 3>
<8, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
