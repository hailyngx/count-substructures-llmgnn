Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new numbering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections,
Node 1 has 3 connections,
Node 2 has 2 connections,
Node 3 has 2 connections,
Node 4 has 2 connections,
Node 5 has 3 connections,
Node 6 has 4 connections,
Node 7 has 1 connection,
Node 8 has 2 connections,
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 1, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 0) forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 1, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with node 2: <1, 2, 5>.
6. Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 5) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 2, 5>.
8. Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 2) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle with node 2: <1, 2, 5>.
13. Edge (5, 2) forms a triangle with node 1: <1, 2, 5>.
14. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with node 6: <6, 8, 9>.
22. Edge (9, 0) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 9>.
23. Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
24. Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle with node 6: <6, 8, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
