Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices by their degrees:

0: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
3: 5 connections
2: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices:

0: 0
1: 1
7: 2
4: 3
5: 4
8: 5
6: 6
9: 7
3: 8
2: 9

We will now analyze the edges in the order of the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

(0, 3): No triangles formed
(1, 5): No triangles formed
(1, 7): No triangles formed
(2, 3): No triangles formed
(2, 6): No triangles formed
(2, 8): No triangles formed
(3, 0): No triangles formed
(3, 2): Triangle formed <0, 2, 3>
(3, 4): No triangles formed
(3, 6): Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>
(4, 3): No triangles formed
(4, 6): No triangles formed
(5, 1): No triangles formed
(5, 9): No triangles formed
(6, 2): Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>
(6, 3): Triangle formed <0, 2, 6>
(6, 4): No triangles formed
(6, 9): No triangles formed
(7, 1): No triangles formed
(7, 8): No triangles formed
(8, 2): No triangles formed
(8, 7): No triangles formed
(8, 9): No triangles formed
(9, 5): No triangles formed
(9, 6): No triangles formed
