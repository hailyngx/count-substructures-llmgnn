Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 0: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 6
Vertex 7: degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will consider each edge as follows:
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 7: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 5: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 7: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 7) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 5: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (2, 1) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 5) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 7: <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 7) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 5: <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 7: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 1) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 7: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 2) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 7: <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (5, 6) forms triangles with vertices 7 and 9: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (5, 7) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) forms triangles with vertices 7 and 9: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 7) forms triangles with vertices 5 and 9: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) forms triangles with vertices 1 and 5: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 1) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 5: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 2) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 5: <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 6) forms triangles with vertices 5 and 9: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles is [7].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 5>, <5, 6, 7>.
