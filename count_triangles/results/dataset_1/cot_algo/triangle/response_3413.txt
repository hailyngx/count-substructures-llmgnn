Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
- Vertex 0 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 7)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
