Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 1 connection.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
Vertex 2 has 7 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their number of connections:
Vertex 1 (1 connection) will be relabeled as 0.
Vertex 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9 (2 connections) will be relabeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
Vertex 6 (3 connections) will be relabeled as 6.
Vertex 8 (5 connections) will be relabeled as 7.
Vertex 3 (6 connections) will be relabeled as 8.
Vertex 2 (7 connections) will be relabeled as 9.

Now, we will check the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Edge (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have fewer connections than 2. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
Triangle <0, 2, 8> found.

Edge (0, 8): 0 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have fewer connections than 3. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (2, 0): 0 has fewer connections than 2. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (2, 3): Both 2 and 3 have fewer connections than 3. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (2, 8): Both 2 and 8 have fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.

Edge (4, 3): 3 has fewer connections than 4. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (4, 5): Both 4 and 5 have fewer connections than 5. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (5, 4): 4 has fewer connections than 5. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (5, 8): 5 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (6, 3): 3 has fewer connections than 6. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (6, 7): Both 6 and 7 have fewer connections than 7. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (6, 9): Both 6 and 9 have fewer connections than 9. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (7, 6): 6 has fewer connections than 7. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (7, 8): 7 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (8, 0): 0 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (8, 2): 2 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (8, 3): 3 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (8, 5): 5 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (8, 7): 7 has fewer connections than 8. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (9, 2): 2 has fewer connections than 9. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Edge (9, 6): 6 has fewer connections than 9. Checking shared connections for a triangle.
No triangle found.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <3, 8, 5>.
