Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 -> A (2 connections)
Node 2 -> B (2 connections)
Node 3 -> C (1 connection)
Node 5 -> D (4 connections)
Node 9 -> E (2 connections)
Node 6 -> F (4 connections)
Node 4 -> G (4 connections)
Node 8 -> H (4 connections)
Node 1 -> I (6 connections)
Node 7 -> J (6 connections)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze each edge:

1. (0, 1) - Node 0 (A) has 2 connections, Node 1 (I) has 6 connections
2. (0, 3) - Node 0 (A) has 2 connections, Node 3 (C) has 1 connection
3. (1, 0) - Skip (already counted)
4. (1, 4) - Node 1 (I) has 6 connections, Node 4 (G) has 4 connections
5. (1, 5) - Node 1 (I) has 6 connections, Node 5 (D) has 4 connections
6. (1, 7) - Node 1 (I) has 6 connections, Node 7 (J) has 6 connections
7. (1, 8) - Node 1 (I) has 6 connections, Node 8 (H) has 4 connections
8. (2, 6) - Node 2 (B) has 2 connections, Node 6 (F) has 4 connections
9. (2, 7) - Node 2 (B) has 2 connections, Node 7 (J) has 6 connections
10. (3, 0) - Skip (already counted)
11. (4, 1) - Skip (already counted)
12. (4, 6) - Node 4 (G) has 4 connections, Node 6 (F) has 4 connections - Triangle: <4, 6, 1>
13. (4, 8) - Node 4 (G) has 4 connections, Node 8 (H) has 4 connections - Triangle: <4, 8, 1>
14. (5, 1) - Skip (already counted)
15. (5, 7) - Node 5 (D) has 4 connections, Node 7 (J) has 6 connections
16. (5, 9) - Node 5 (D) has 4 connections, Node 9 (E) has 2 connections
17. (6, 2) - Skip (already counted)
18. (6, 4) - Skip (already counted)
19. (6, 7) - Node 6 (F) has 4 connections, Node 7 (J) has 6 connections
20. (7, 1) - Skip (already counted)
21. (7, 2) - Skip (already counted)
22. (7, 5) - Skip (already counted)
23. (7, 6) - Skip (already counted)
24. (7, 8) - Node 7 (J) has 6 connections, Node 8 (H) has 4 connections
25. (8, 1) - Skip (already counted)
26. (8, 4) - Skip (already counted)
27. (8, 7) - Skip (already counted)
28. (8, 9) - Node 8 (H) has 4 connections, Node 9 (E) has 2 connections
29. (9, 5) - Skip (already counted)
30. (9, 8) - Skip (already counted)

Count of triangles: [2]
Triangles: <4, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 1>
