Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: degree 2
1: degree 2
5: degree 1
6: degree 3
7: degree 3
4: degree 4
9: degree 4
3: degree 5
8: degree 5
2: degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
