Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 1 -> Degree 1
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 3
Node 4 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 5
Node 9 -> Degree 4
Node 5 -> Degree 5
Node 2 -> Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find that there are 9 triangles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 5>.
