Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices by their number of connections:  
Vertex 2: 1 connections  
Vertex 1: 1 connections  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 1 connections  
Vertex 6: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 5 connections  
Vertex 0: 5 connections  

Edges sorted by the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:  
(2, 9)  
(1, 5)  
(8, 0)  
(7, 3)  
(6, 9)  
(1, 5)  
(1, 5)  
(2, 9)  
(8, 0)  
(6, 9)  
(3, 7)  
(3, 7)  
(4, 9)  
(9, 6)  
(9, 6)
