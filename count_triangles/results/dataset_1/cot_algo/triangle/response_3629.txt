Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 1>
