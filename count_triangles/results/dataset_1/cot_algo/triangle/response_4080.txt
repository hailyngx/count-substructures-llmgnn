Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:
1. Node 2 has degree 0
2. Node 3 has degree 0
3. Node 8 has degree 1
4. Node 9 has degree 2
5. Node 0 has degree 3
6. Node 6 has degree 3
7. Node 1 has degree 4
8. Node 4 has degree 4
9. Node 7 has degree 4
10. Node 5 has degree 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the order specified. 

Triangles found:
1. <0, 5, 7>
2. <0, 5, 9>
3. <1, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [3]
