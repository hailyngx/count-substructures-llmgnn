Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

Node 9: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

Node 9 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 7 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Node 6 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 2 (3 connections) -> Node 4
Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 6
Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 9

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
- Node 0 and Node 1 do not share any common connections.

For edge (0, 4):
- Node 0 and Node 4 share a common connection with Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 4>

For edge (0, 8):
- Node 0 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.

For edge (1, 0):
- Node 1 and Node 0 do not share any common connections.

For edge (1, 2):
- Node 1 and Node 2 do not share any common connections.

For edge (1, 3):
- Node 1 and Node 3 share a common connection with Node 5, forming a triangle: <1, 5, 3>

For edge (1, 5):
- Node 1 and Node 5 do not share any common connections.

For edge (2, 1):
- Node 2 and Node 1 do not share any common connections.

For edge (2, 4):
- Node 2 and Node 4 do not share any common connections.

For edge (3, 1):
- Node 3 and Node 1 share a common connection with Node 5, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 1>

For edge (3, 5):
- Node 3 and Node 5 share a common connection with Node 1, forming a triangle: <3, 1, 5>

For edge (3, 6):
- Node 3 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.

For edge (4, 0):
- Node 4 and Node 0 share a common connection with Node 2, forming a triangle: <4, 2, 0>

For edge (4, 2):
- Node 4 and Node 2 do not share any common connections.

For edge (5, 1):
- Node 5 and Node 1 do not share any common connections.

For edge (5, 3):
- Node 5 and Node 3 share a common connection with Node 1, forming a triangle: <5, 1, 3>

For edge (5, 8):
- Node 5 and Node 8 do not share any common connections.

For edge (6, 3):
- Node 6 and Node 3 do not share any common connections.

For edge (6, 7):
- Node 6 and Node 7 do not share any common connections.

For edge (7, 6):
- Node 7 and Node 6 do not share any common connections.

For edge (8, 0):
- Node 8 and Node 0 do not share any common connections.

For edge (8, 5):
- Node 8 and Node 5 do not share any common connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 3>, <3, 1, 5>, and <4, 2, 0>.
