Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:  

Node 5 - 0 connections  
Node 7 - 1 connection  
Node 4 - 2 connections  
Node 3 - 2 connections  
Node 6 - 3 connections  
Node 2 - 4 connections  
Node 1 - 4 connections  
Node 10 - 4 connections  
Node 8 - 5 connections  
Node 9 - 5 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>  
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 8>  
- Triangle 3: <0, 9, 7>  
- Triangle 4: <2, 8, 4>  
- Triangle 5: <9, 6, 8>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
