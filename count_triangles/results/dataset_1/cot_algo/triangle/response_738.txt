Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, the nodes are relabeled accordingly.

Here is the sorted list of nodes based on their degrees:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the number of triangles:
- Node 7 doesn't form any triangles.
- Node 6: No triangles can be formed.
- Node 2: No triangles possible.
- Node 0 forms 1 triangle: <0, 1, 4>.
- Node 8 forms 2 triangles: <3, 8, 6> and <3, 8, 9>.
- Node 5 forms 3 triangles: <2, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 4>, and <3, 5, 9>.
- Node 1 forms 3 triangles: <1, 0, 4>, <1, 4, 3>, and <1, 4, 5>.
- Node 9 forms 4 triangles: <3, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 5>, <5, 9, 2>, and <5, 9, 3>.
- Node 3 forms 5 triangles: <3, 8, 6>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 5, 9>, and <4, 1, 0>.
- Node 4 forms 6 triangles: <4, 1, 0>, <4, 3, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <1, 0, 7>, <5, 9, 2>, and <5, 9, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [24].
