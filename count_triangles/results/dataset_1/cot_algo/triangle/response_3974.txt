Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their number of connections (from least to most connections):
- Node 2 -> A
- Node 1 -> B
- Node 4 -> C
- Node 5 -> D
- Node 3 -> E
- Node 7 -> F
- Node 9 -> G
- Node 0 -> H
- Node 8 -> I
- Node 6 -> J

The edges in the new labeling are as follows:
(A, B), (A, I), (A, F), (B, C), (B, I), (C, B), (E, H), (E, I), (E, G), (C, D), (C, I), (D, C), (D, F), (D, J), (H, A), (H, I), (H, F), (I, B), (I, C), (I, F), (G, E), (G, F)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <A, B, I>
- Triangle 2: <A, F, H>
- Triangle 3: <B, C, I>
- Triangle 4: <C, D, F>
- Triangle 5: <E, G, F>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
