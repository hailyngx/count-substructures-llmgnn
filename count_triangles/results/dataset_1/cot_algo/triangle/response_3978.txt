Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 6

Ordering the vertices by degree in ascending order, we get:
- Vertex 7 (degree 1)
- Vertex 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 3)
- Vertex 6 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (1, 2): Triangle formed with vertex 1, 2, 6. Triangle: <1, 2, 6>
- For edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (2, 1): Already counted.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
- For edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- For edge (3, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 3, 6, 9. Triangle: <3, 6, 9>
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 9): Triangle formed with vertex 5, 9, 6. Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
- For edge (6, 1): Already counted.
- For edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
- For edge (6, 9): Already counted.
- For edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 3): Already counted.
- For edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (9, 6): Already counted.

Total number of triangles: 3
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the answer is [3].
