Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count triangles efficiently. Let's proceed step by step:

1. First, let's determine the degree of each vertex in the graph:
   - Node 0: degree 3
   - Node 1: degree 3
   - Node 2: degree 1
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 4
   - Node 5: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 4
   - Node 7: degree 4
   - Node 8: degree 3
   - Node 9: degree 4

2. Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees (from least to most connections):
   - Node 2, Node 5
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 8
   - Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9

3. Next, let's list the triangles present in the graph:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 6, 7>
   - Triangle 5: <1, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <1, 7, 9>
   - Triangle 7: <3, 4, 7>
   - Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>
   - Triangle 9: <4, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 10: <4, 6, 9>
   - Triangle 11: <4, 7, 9>

4. Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
