Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles efficiently. 
First, let's determine the connections for each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Arrange the nodes based on their connections from least to most:
1. Node 1
2. Node 3
3. Node 6
4. Node 7
5. Node 9
6. Node 0
7. Node 5
8. Node 4

Now, we will iterate over each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 5):
  Node 1 has 1 connection, and Node 5 has 3 connections. Proceed.
  There is 1 shared connection with Node 0. Triangle found: <1, 5, 0>.

- Edge (3, 4):
  Node 3 has 1 connection, and Node 4 has 5 connections. Proceed.
  There are no shared connections. No triangle.

- Edge (4, 0):
  Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 0 has 3 connections. Proceed.
  There are 2 shared connections with Nodes 3 and 7. Triangles found: <4, 0, 3>, <4, 0, 7>.

- Edge (4, 6):
  Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 6 has 2 connections. Proceed.
  There is 1 shared connection with Node 9. Triangle found: <4, 6, 9>.

- Edge (4, 7):
  Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 7 has 2 connections. Proceed.
  There is 1 shared connection with Node 0. Triangle found: <4, 7, 0>.

- Edge (5, 9):
  Node 5 has 3 connections, and Node 9 has 3 connections. Proceed.
  There is 1 shared connection with Node 0. Triangle found: <5, 9, 0>.

In total, we found 6 triangles. Therefore, the output is: [6].
