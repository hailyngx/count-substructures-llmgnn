Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree, we have the following new edge list:
(0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles: 5
Unique Triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <4, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles is [5].
