Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph with vertices sorted by degree in ascending order: 
Vertices: 3, 7, 0, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8, 9, 4

Calculating the number of triangles using the degree-based ordering method:
- For edge (0, 1), proceed as vertex 0 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: [9]
- For edge (0, 9), proceed as vertex 0 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: [1, 4, 8]
- For edge (1, 2), proceed as vertex 1 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (1, 8), proceed as vertex 1 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (2, 4), proceed as vertex 2 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (4, 5), proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (4, 6), proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (4, 9), proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (5, 4), proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (6, 4), proceed as vertex 4 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (7, 8), proceed as vertex 7 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (8, 9), proceed as vertex 8 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: []
- For edge (9, 0), proceed as vertex 9 has fewer connections:
  Shared connections with vertices: [1, 4, 8]

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 9>
