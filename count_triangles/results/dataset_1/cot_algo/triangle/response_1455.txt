Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3: degree 0
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 5

Now, we will check each edge using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have degree 4, and there are common neighbors 8 and 9.
2. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has degree 4, and Vertex 5 has degree 1. No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (0, 8): Both vertices have degree 4, and there are common neighbors 2 and 9.
4. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have degree 4, and there are common neighbors 2 and 8.
5. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have degree 3, and there are common neighbors 8.
6. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has degree 3, and Vertex 4 has degree 2. No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has degree 3, and Vertex 6 has degree 1. No triangle is formed.
8. Edge (2, 8): Both vertices have degree 4, and there are common neighbors 0 and 9.
9. Edge (2, 9): Both vertices have degree 4, and there are common neighbors 0 and 8.
10. Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has degree 2, and Vertex 8 has degree 5. No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 5 has degree 1, and Vertex 0 has degree 4. No triangle is formed.
12. Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 has degree 1, and Vertex 1 has degree 3. No triangle is formed.
13. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has degree 1, and Vertex 9 has degree 5. No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, and <2, 8, 9>.
