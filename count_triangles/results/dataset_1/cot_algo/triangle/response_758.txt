Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 2: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 7, Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0, Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3, Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections

Relabeled graph with the new order:
Node 2, Node 6, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 0, Node 4, Node 3, Node 9, Node 1

Now, we go through the edges in the original graph:
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has connections with Nodes 3 and 9, so we have a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 has connections with Nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9, creating triangles <1, 4, 3> and <1, 4, 9>.
- Edge (1, 8) and (1, 9): No new triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has connections with Nodes 1 and 9, forming a triangle <3, 7, 1>.
- Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has connections with Nodes 1 and 9, forming a triangle <3, 9, 1>.
- Edge (4, 5): No new triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 7): Node 4 has connections with Nodes 1, 3, and 9, forming triangles <4, 7, 3> and <4, 7, 1>.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 has connections with Nodes 1, 3, and 9, forming triangles <4, 9, 3> and <4, 9, 1>.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has a connection with Node 8, but no new triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 9>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 9, 1>, <4, 7, 3>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 9, 3>, <4, 9, 1>
