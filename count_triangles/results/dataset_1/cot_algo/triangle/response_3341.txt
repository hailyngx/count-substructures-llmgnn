Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3, 5 have 2 connections.
Node 7, 9 have 3 connections.
Node 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 connections.
Node 0, 1, 2 have 4 connections.
Node 8 and 6 have highest 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and based on the given edges, we analyze only those edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections:

- For edge (0, 1), nodes 0 and 1 form a triangle with node 8: <0, 1, 8>.
- For edge (0, 6), nodes 0 and 6 form a triangle with node 8: <0, 6, 8>.
- For edge (0, 8), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (1, 2), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (1, 8), node 1 and 8 form a triangle with node 0: <1, 8, 0>.
- For edge (2, 6), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (2, 9), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (3, 4), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (3, 5), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (4, 6), no triangles are formed.
- For edge (4, 8), node 4 and 8 form a triangle with node 6: <4, 8, 6>.
- For edge (6, 7), nodes 6 and 7 form a triangle with node 8: <6, 7, 8>.
- For edge (6, 8), node 6 and 8 form a triangle with node 0: <6, 8, 0>.
- For edge (6, 4), no additional triangles are formed.
- For edge (6, 8), already accounted for.
- For edge (6, 7), already accounted for.
- For edge (7, 8), no additional triangles are formed.
- For edge (8, 9), no triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 6>, and <6, 7, 8>.
