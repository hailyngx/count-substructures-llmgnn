Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
We will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4 and Node 6 have 1 connection each.
- Node 1, Node 8, and Node 9 have 2 connections each.
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 2 have 3 connections each.
- Node 5 and Node 7 have 4 connections each.

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 4 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 6 (Degree 1) -> Node 1
- Node 1 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
- Node 8 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
- Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 4
- Node 0 (Degree 3) -> Node 5
- Node 3 (Degree 3) -> Node 6
- Node 2 (Degree 3) -> Node 7
- Node 5 (Degree 4) -> Node 8
- Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 9

Now, we will check the edges:
- (0, 4) and (4, 0): Shared connection with Node 5 gives triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- (0, 5) and (5, 0): No triangles formed.
- (1, 7) and (7, 1): Shared connection with Node 2 gives triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- (2, 5) and (5, 2): Share connection with Node 7 gives triangle <2, 5, 7>.
- (2, 9) and (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- (3, 8) and (8, 3): No triangles formed.
- (3, 9) and (9, 3): Shared connection with Node 3 gives triangle <3, 9, 6>.
- (4, 0) and (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- (5, 0) and (0, 4): Shared connection with Node 2 gives triangle <5, 0, 7>.
- (5, 2) and (2, 5): Share connection with Node 7 gives triangle <5, 2, 7>.
- (5, 7) and (7, 5): Shared connection with Node 2 gives triangle <5, 7, 3>.
- (6, 7) and (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- (7, 1) and (1, 7): Share connection with Node 2 gives triangle <7, 1, 2>.
- (7, 5) and (5, 7): Shared connection with Node 2 gives triangle <7, 5, 3>.
- (7, 6) and (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- (8, 3) and (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- (9, 2) and (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- (9, 3) and (3, 9): Shared connection with Node 6 gives triangle <9, 3, 6>.

Count of unique triangles found: 5
Total number of triangles: [5]
