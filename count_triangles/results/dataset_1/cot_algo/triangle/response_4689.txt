Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:
Node 3 -> Degree 0
Node 9 -> Degree 0
Node 7, 2, 4, 8 -> Degree 1
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 5 -> Degree 4
Node 1 -> Degree 7

Now, we will start counting the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (3, 1):
    - Node 3 has no connections.
    - Node 1 has 7 connections.
    - No triangle formed.

2. Edge (9, 6):
    - Node 9 has no connections.
    - Node 6 has 3 connections.
    - No triangle formed.

3. Edge (7, 8):
    - Node 7 has 1 connection.
    - Node 8 has 1 connection.
    - No triangle formed.

4. Edge (4, 5):
    - Node 4 has 1 connection.
    - Node 5 has 4 connections.
    - Triangle formed: <4, 5, 1>.

5. Edge (7, 6):
    - Node 7 has 1 connection.
    - Node 6 has 3 connections.
    - No triangle formed.

6. Edge (8, 1):
    - Node 8 has 1 connection.
    - Node 1 has 7 connections.
    - Triangle formed: <8, 1, 5>.

7. Edge (4, 1):
    - Node 4 has 1 connection.
    - Node 1 has 7 connections.
    - Triangle formed: <4, 1, 5>.

8. Edge (5, 1):
    - Node 5 has 4 connections.
    - Node 1 has 7 connections.
    - Triangle formed: <5, 1, 4>.

[Total number of triangles: 3]
