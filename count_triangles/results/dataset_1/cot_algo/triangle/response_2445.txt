Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 0
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes: 5, 1, 7, 9, 8, 6, 0, 4, 2, 3.

Now, we count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
