Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4)
   - Shared connections: None

2. Edge (0, 6)
   - Shared connections: None

3. Edge (1, 3)
   - Shared connections: None

4. Edge (1, 4)
   - Shared connections: None

5. Edge (1, 5)
   - Shared connections: None

6. Edge (1, 7)
   - Shared connections: None

7. Edge (2, 9)
   - Shared connections: None

8. Edge (3, 1)
   - Shared connections: None

9. Edge (4, 0)
   - Shared connections: None

10. Edge (4, 1)
   - Shared connections: None

11. Edge (4, 5)
   - Shared connections: Node 1

12. Edge (5, 1)
   - Shared connections: Node 4

13. Edge (5, 4)
   - Shared connections: Node 1

14. Edge (5, 6)
   - Shared connections: None

15. Edge (6, 0)
   - Shared connections: None

16. Edge (6, 5)
   - Shared connections: None

17. Edge (6, 7)
   - Shared connections: None

18. Edge (7, 1)
   - Shared connections: None

19. Edge (7, 6)
   - Shared connections: None

20. Edge (8, 9)
   - Shared connections: None

21. Edge (9, 2)
   - Shared connections: None

22. Edge (9, 8)
   - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <1, 4, 5>.
