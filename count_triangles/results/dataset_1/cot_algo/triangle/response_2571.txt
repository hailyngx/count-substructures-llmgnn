Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections (degree):

Node 0 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 5

Following the method, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Examining edge (0, 2):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 4.
Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 0 and Node 2 share Node 5.
Therefore, triangle <0, 2, 5> is found.

Examining edge (0, 4):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 4.
Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
There are no shared connections, so no triangle is formed.

Examining edge (2, 3):
Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 5, and 9.
Node 2 and Node 3 do not share any connections, so no triangle is formed.

Examining edge (2, 5):
Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 5 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
No new triangle is formed as <0, 2, 5> is already counted.

Examining edge (2, 8):
Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 8 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 9.
Node 2 and Node 8 share Node 4.
Therefore, triangle <2, 4, 8> is found.

Examining edge (3, 5):
Node 3 has connections with nodes 2, 5, and 9.
Node 5 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
Node 3 and Node 5 share Node 2.
Therefore, triangle <2, 3, 5> is found.

Examining remaining edges don't form any new triangles.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5> and <2, 4, 8>.
