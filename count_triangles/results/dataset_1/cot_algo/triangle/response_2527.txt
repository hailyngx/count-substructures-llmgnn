Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes:
Node 1 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 6 (degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 7 (degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 5
Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 2 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 9 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 9

Now, we go through each edge and count the triangles:
Considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
Edge (0, 5) forms triangle with 9: <0, 5, 9>
Edge (0, 9) forms triangle with 5: <0, 9, 5>
Edge (2, 6) forms no triangles
Edge (3, 9) forms no triangles
Edge (6, 8) forms no triangles
Edge (7, 4) forms no triangles
Edge (7, 2) forms triangle with 9: <7, 2, 9>
Edge (8, 9) forms no triangles

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 9, 5>, <7, 2, 9>
