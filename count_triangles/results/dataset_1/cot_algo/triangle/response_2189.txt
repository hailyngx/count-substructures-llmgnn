Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will proceed as follows:

Sort the nodes by their degrees in increasing order:
Nodes by index: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Degrees: [3, 1, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1]

Relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: [1, 2, 8, 9, 0, 5, 3, 6, 7, 4]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we now start counting triangles:

For edge (0, 4):
Node 0 < Node 4
Shared connections between 0 and 4: [3, 5]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

For edge (0, 5):
Node 0 < Node 5
Shared connections between 0 and 5: [3]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

For edge (0, 6):
Node 0 < Node 6
Shared connections between 0 and 6: [3]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

For edge (1, 4):
Node 1 < Node 4
Shared connections between 1 and 4: []
No triangle found.

For edge (2, 9):
Node 2 < Node 9
Shared connections between 2 and 9: []
No triangle found.

For edge (3, 4):
Node 3 < Node 4
Shared connections between 3 and 4: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 4>

For edge (3, 5):
Node 3 < Node 5
Shared connections between 3 and 5: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

For edge (3, 6):
Node 3 < Node 6
Shared connections between 3 and 6: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

For edge (4, 7):
Node 4 < Node 7
Shared connections between 4 and 7: []
No triangle found.

For edge (4, 0):
Node 0 < Node 4
Shared connections between 4 and 0: [3, 5]

Node 1 < Node 4
Shared connections between 4 and 1: []
No triangle found.

For edge (4, 3):
Node 3 < Node 4
Shared connections between 4 and 3: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 4>

For edge (4, 7):
Node 4 < Node 7
Shared connections between 4 and 7: []
No triangle found.

For edge (5, 0):
Node 0 < Node 5
Shared connections between 5 and 0: [3]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

For edge (5, 3):
Node 3 < Node 5
Shared connections between 5 and 3: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

For edge (6, 0):
Node 0 < Node 6
Shared connections between 6 and 0: [3]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

For edge (6, 3):
Node 3 < Node 6
Shared connections between 6 and 3: [0]
Triangle found: <0, 3, 6>

For edge (6, 7):
Node 6 < Node 7
Shared connections between 6 and 7: []
No triangle found.

For edge (7, 4):
Node 4 < Node 7
Shared connections between 7 and 4: []
No triangle found.

For edge (7, 6):
Node 6 < Node 7
Shared connections between 7 and 6: []
No triangle found.

For edge (7, 8):
Node 7 < Node 8
Shared connections between 7 and 8: []
No triangle found.

For edge (8, 7):
Node 7 < Node 8
Shared connections between 8 and 7: []
No triangle found.

For edge (9, 2):
Node 2 < Node 9
Shared connections between 9 and 2: []
No triangle found.

The total number of triangles is: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 5>.
