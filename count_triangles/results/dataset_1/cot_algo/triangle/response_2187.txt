Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
0(2) 1(2) 3(2) 4(1) 7(2) 8(2) 5(3) 6(3) 9(6) 2(4)

Triangles found:
<0, 2, 9> <0, 7, 5> <0, 9, 6> <2, 1, 3> <2, 5, 7> <2, 5, 9> <2, 6, 9> <2, 9, 3> <5, 7, 0> <6, 9, 0> <9, 8, 4> 

Total number of triangles: [11]
