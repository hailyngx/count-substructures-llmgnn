Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degrees of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 4

Next, we will analyze the edges according to the degree-based ordering:
- Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (0, 4): Both vertices have degrees greater than 2, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has degree 1, which is less than the degree of vertex 2. No shared connections, so this edge does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (2, 1): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has degree 4, while vertex 4 has degree 3. Shared connection with vertex 0. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has degree 4, while vertex 7 has degree 2. No shared connections, so this edge does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 9): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (4, 0): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (4, 2): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 2): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 4): Skipped as per the degree-based ordering.
- Edge (9, 3): Vertex 3 has degree 1, while vertex 9 has degree 3. No shared connections, so this edge does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.
