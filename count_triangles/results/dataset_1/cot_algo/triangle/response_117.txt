Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 1 (1 connection) becomes Vertex A
- Vertex 5, 7, and 9 (1 connection) become Vertices B, C, and D respectively
- Vertex 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 (3 connections) become Vertices E, F, G, H, I, and J respectively

Next, we will list the edges that follow the conditions where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (A, B): Not considered (Vertex A has fewer connections than Vertex B)
- Edge (A, C): Not considered (Vertex A has fewer connections than Vertex C)
- Edge (A, D): Not considered (Vertex A has fewer connections than Vertex D)
- Edge (B, C): Not considered (Vertex B has fewer connections than Vertex C)
- Edge (B, D): Not considered (Vertex B has fewer connections than Vertex D)
- Edge (C, D): Not considered (Vertex C has fewer connections than Vertex D)
- Edge (E, F): Triangle <0, 2, 3> found
- Edge (E, G): Not considered (Vertex E has fewer connections than Vertex G)
- Edge (E, I): Not considered (Vertex E has fewer connections than Vertex I)
- Edge (F, G): Triangle <0, 2, 6> found
- Edge (F, H): Not considered (Vertex F has fewer connections than Vertex H)
- Edge (F, I): Not considered (Vertex F has fewer connections than Vertex I)
- Edge (G, H): Triangle <2, 4, 6> found
- Edge (G, J): Not considered (Vertex G has fewer connections than Vertex J)
- Edge (H, I): Triangle <3, 4, 8> found
- Edge (H, J): Not considered (Vertex H has fewer connections than Vertex J)
- Edge (I, J): Not considered (Vertex I has fewer connections than Vertex J)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, and <2, 4, 6>.
