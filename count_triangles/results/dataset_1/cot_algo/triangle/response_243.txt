Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 8 (1 connection) --> Node 1
Node 1 (2 connections) --> Node 2
Node 5 (2 connections) --> Node 3
Node 4 (2 connections) --> Node 4
Node 6 (3 connections) --> Node 5
Node 0 (5 connections) --> Node 6
Node 3 (4 connections) --> Node 7
Node 7 (4 connections) --> Node 8
Node 9 (4 connections) --> Node 9
Node 2 (4 connections) --> Node 10

Now, we will iterate through the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections for Node 6 and Node 10 -> Forms a triangle with Node 2
- Edge (0, 4): Check for shared connections for Node 6 and Node 4 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 6): Check for shared connections for Node 6 and Node 5 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 7): Check for shared connections for Node 6 and Node 8 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (0, 9): Check for shared connections for Node 6 and Node 9 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 5): Check for shared connections for Node 2 and Node 3 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (1, 7): Check for shared connections for Node 2 and Node 8 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 0): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (0, 2))
- Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections for Node 10 and Node 7 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections for Node 10 and Node 3 -> Forms a triangle with Node 1
- Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections for Node 10 and Node 8 -> Forms a triangle with Node 6
- Edge (3, 2): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (2, 3))
- Edge (3, 6): Check for shared connections for Node 7 and Node 5 -> Forms a triangle with Node 0
- Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections for Node 7 and Node 8 -> Forms a triangle with Node 5
- Edge (3, 9): Check for shared connections for Node 7 and Node 9 -> Forms a triangle with Node 6
- Edge (4, 0): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (0, 4))
- Edge (4, 9): Check for shared connections for Node 4 and Node 9 -> No triangle formed
- Edge (5, 1): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (1, 5))
- Edge (5, 2): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (2, 5))
- Edge (6, 0): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (0, 6))
- Edge (6, 3): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (3, 6))
- Edge (6, 8): Check for shared connections for Node 5 and Node 8 -> Forms a triangle with Node 7
- Edge (7, 0): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (0, 7))
- Edge (7, 1): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (1, 7))
- Edge (7, 2): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (2, 7))
- Edge (7, 3): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (3, 7))
- Edge (9, 0): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (0, 9))
- Edge (9, 3): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (3, 9))
- Edge (9, 4): Skipped (Already counted in Edge (4, 9))

After going through all edges, we found the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 1>
- <2, 7, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
