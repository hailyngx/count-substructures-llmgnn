Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
We will first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3: degree 1
Node 6: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 2: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 3 -> A
Node 6 -> B
Node 8 -> C
Node 2 -> D
Node 7 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 9 -> G
Node 4 -> H
Node 5 -> I
Node 0 -> J

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the labels of the vertices to count the triangles:

(0, 1): Both are connected to node 5 (I), so triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>
(0, 4): Both are connected to node 5 (I), so triangle formed: <0, 4, 5>
(0, 5): Both are connected to nodes 1 (F) and 4 (H), so triangle formed: <0, 1, 5> and <0, 4, 5>
(0, 8): No triangle formed.
(0, 9): Both are connected to node 4 (H), so triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>
(1, 5): Both are connected to node 0 (J), so triangle formed: <1, 0, 5>
(2, 9): No triangle formed.
(3, 7): No triangle formed.
(4, 7): Both are connected to node 5 (I), so triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
(4, 9): Both are connected to node 5 (I), so triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>
(5, 6): No triangle formed.

Count of triangles inside brackets: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 0, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 9>
