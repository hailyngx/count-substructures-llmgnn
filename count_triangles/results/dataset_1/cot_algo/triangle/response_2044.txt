Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 4 has 0 connections.  
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.  
Vertices 5 and 8 have 2 connections each.  
Vertices 1, 6, and 9 have 3 connections each.  
Vertices 0 and 7 have 4 connections each.  
Vertex 2 has 5 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7> and <0, 7, 9>.
4. Edge (0, 9): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.
5. Edge (1, 7): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>.
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 0): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle <0, 7, 6>.
15. Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle <0, 1, 8>.
16. Edge (6, 9): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.
17. Edge (7, 0): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>.
18. Edge (7, 1): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>.
19. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 6): Forms triangle <0, 7, 6>.
21. Edge (7, 9): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.
22. Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
24. Edge (8, 6): Forms triangle <0, 1, 8>.
25. Edge (9, 0): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.
26. Edge (9, 6): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.
27. Edge (9, 7): Forms triangle <0, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
