Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 4
Vertex 1 has degree 4
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 1
Vertex 5 has degree 2
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 5

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now check the edges to count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 5.
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <0, 8, 6>
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 9.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <1, 9, 6>
- Edge (2, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <2, 0, 6>
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 0.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <6, 8, 7>
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <7, 9, 0>
- Edge (8, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <8, 0, 6>
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <8, 9, 7>
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle as vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 0.
- Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <9, 1, 6>
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle as the degree-based ordering condition is not met.

Total number of triangles: [5]
