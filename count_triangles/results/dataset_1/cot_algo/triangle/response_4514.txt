Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the relabeled vertices are:  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 2 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 5)  
Node 8 (Degree 6)  
Node 7 (Degree 6)  
Node 4 (Degree 6)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
