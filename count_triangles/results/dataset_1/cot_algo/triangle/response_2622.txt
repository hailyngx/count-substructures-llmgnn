Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the relabeled graph is as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes: 4, 5, 6
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 3, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes: 0, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will now check for triangles:
1. Triangle <5, 8, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
