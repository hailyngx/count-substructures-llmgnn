Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify the triangles and count them. The triangles in this graph are:

<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 2>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
