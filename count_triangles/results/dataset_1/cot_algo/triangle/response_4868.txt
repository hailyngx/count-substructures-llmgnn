Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Nodes: 0 [6], 1 [3], 2 [6], 3 [2], 4 [5], 5 [4], 6 [5], 7 [6], 8 [5], 9 [4]

Calculating the number of triangles:
For edge (0, 2):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are shared connections, forming triangles (<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 8>)

For other edges, there are no additional unique triangles.

Hence, the total number of triangles is [5] inside brackets.
