Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes by their number of connections from least to most:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 2: 3 connections
Nodes 5, 8: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 9: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Next, we relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 3 -> A
Node 6 -> B
Node 0 -> C
Node 2 -> D
Node 5 -> E
Node 8 -> F
Node 1 -> G
Node 9 -> H
Node 4 -> I
Node 7 -> J

Now, we go through each edge and check for triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 4>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 8, 0>
<5, 8, 1>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 5, 2>
<7, 6, 0>
<8, 0, 4>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 1, 4>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 5, 7>
<9, 1, 4>

Total number of triangles: [20]
