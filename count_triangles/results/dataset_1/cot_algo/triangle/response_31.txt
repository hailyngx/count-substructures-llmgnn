Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's label the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we'll list the edges in increasing order of the degree of their lower degree vertices:
(0, 4), (8, 4), (9, 1), (0, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (8, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 5)

Now, we'll count the triangles using the shared connection method:
- Triangle 1: <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle 3: <3, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
