Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices and their corresponding degrees (number of connections):

Vertices:
0 - 2 connections
1 - 2 connections
2 - 3 connections
4 - 1 connection
5 - 4 connections
7 - 1 connection
8 - 3 connections

Next, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertices:
4 - 1 connection (labeled as 0)
7 - 1 connection (labeled as 1)
1 - 2 connections (labeled as 2)
0 - 2 connections (labeled as 3)
8 - 3 connections (labeled as 4)
2 - 3 connections (labeled as 5)
5 - 4 connections (labeled as 6)

Now, we will find the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
