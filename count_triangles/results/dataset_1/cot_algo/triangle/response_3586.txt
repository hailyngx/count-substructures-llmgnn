Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 1, 8: 1 connection
Nodes 2, 6: 2 connections
Nodes 3, 5: 4 connections
Nodes 0, 9: 5 connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 9, 6>
