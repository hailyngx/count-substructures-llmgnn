Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their number of connections:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now proceed to count the triangles:

1. (0, 2): Shared connections with 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. (0, 4): No triangles.
3. (1, 3): No triangles.
4. (1, 5): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
5. (1, 7): No triangles.
6. (2, 0): Shared connections with 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
7. (2, 3): No triangles.
8. (2, 5): No triangles.
9. (3, 1): No triangles.
10. (3, 2): No triangles.
11. (3, 8): No triangles.
12. (4, 0): Shared connections with 6, forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
13. (4, 6): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
14. (4, 7): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>.
15. (4, 8): Shared connections with 3, forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
16. (5, 1): Shared connections with 7, forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
17. (5, 2): No triangles.
18. (5, 6): Shared connections with 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
19. (5, 7): Shared connections with 4, forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>.
20. (5, 9): Shared connections with 6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
21. (6, 4): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
22. (6, 5): Shared connections with 9, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
23. (6, 9): No triangles.
24. (7, 1): No triangles.
25. (7, 4): Shared connections with 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 7>.
26. (7, 5): Shared connections with 9, forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
27. (7, 9): No triangles.
28. (8, 3): No triangles.
29. (8, 4): Shared connections with 3, forming a triangle <3, 4, 8>.
30. (9, 5): Shared connections with 6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
31. (9, 6): No triangles.
32. (9, 7): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
