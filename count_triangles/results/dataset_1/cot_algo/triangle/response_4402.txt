Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly.

The sorted vertices with their degrees are as follows:
1. Node 0 - degree 3
2. Node 2 - degree 4
3. Node 4 - degree 3
4. Node 6 - degree 3
5. Node 7 - degree 3
6. Node 9 - degree 4
7. Node 1 - degree 9
8. Node 5 - degree 4
9. Node 3 - degree 5
10. Node 8 - degree 7

Next, we will check for triangles starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

Counting the number of triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
1. <1, 4, 8>
2. <1, 5, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>
4. <1, 7, 8>
5. <3, 5, 8>
6. <3, 4, 8>
7. <4, 2, 8>
8. <6, 2, 8>
9. <7, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
