Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 3
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 1

Next, we'll relabel the nodes based on their degrees from least to most connected:

Node 9: degree 1
Node 3: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4

Now, we'll count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Node 9 (1 connection): No triangles involving node 9.
2. Node 3 (2 connections) with nodes 0 and 8:
   - Triangle <0, 3, 8>
3. Node 6 (2 connections) with nodes 2 and 7:
   - Triangle <2, 6, 7>
4. Node 0 (3 connections) with nodes 3, 4, and 8:
   - No additional triangles.
5. Node 1 (3 connections) with nodes 2 and 7:
   - No triangles involving node 1.
6. Node 4 (3 connections) with nodes 0, 2, and 9:
   - Triangle <0, 4, 2>
7. Node 2 (4 connections) with nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7:
   - No additional triangles.
8. Node 7 (4 connections) with nodes 1, 2, and 6:
   - No additional triangles.
9. Node 8 (4 connections) with nodes 0, 1, and 3:
   - No additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 7>, and <0, 4, 2>.
