Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices with their respective connections are as follows:
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by the shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [12]
