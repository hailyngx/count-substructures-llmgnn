Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 9: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Vertex 0, Vertex 1, Vertex 2 form a triangle: <0, 1, 2>
2. Vertex 0, Vertex 3, Vertex 4 form a triangle: <0, 3, 4>
3. Vertex 0, Vertex 3, Vertex 7 form a triangle: <0, 3, 7>
4. Vertex 0, Vertex 4, Vertex 7 form a triangle: <0, 4, 7>
5. Vertex 0, Vertex 5, Vertex 7 form a triangle: <0, 5, 7>
6. Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 5 form a triangle: <1, 2, 5>
7. Vertex 3, Vertex 4, Vertex 9 form a triangle: <3, 4, 9>
8. Vertex 3, Vertex 7, Vertex 4 form a triangle: <3, 4, 7>
9. Vertex 3, Vertex 7, Vertex 5 form a triangle: <3, 5, 7>
10. Vertex 5, Vertex 2, Vertex 7 form a triangle: <5, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
