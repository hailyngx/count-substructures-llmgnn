Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices by degree:
0: 4
1: 3
2: 3
3: 3
4: 3
5: 5
6: 4
7: 2
8: 2
9: 5

Now, we relabel the vertices in ascending order of degrees:
0: 7
1: 8
2: 9
3: 7
4: 8
5: 6
6: 0
7: 3
8: 1
9: 5

Now, we count the triangles:
We focus on edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
Triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
