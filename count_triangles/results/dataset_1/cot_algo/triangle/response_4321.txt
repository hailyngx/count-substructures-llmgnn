Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 1 (label 0): 1 connections
Vertex 2 (label 1): 1 connections
Vertex 3 (label 2): 2 connections
Vertex 4 (label 3): 2 connections
Vertex 5 (label 4): 3 connections
Vertex 6 (label 5): 8 connections
Vertex 7 (label 6): 4 connections
Vertex 8 (label 7): 2 connections
Vertex 9 (label 8): 1 connections
Vertex 10 (label 9): 1 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
