Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices from least to most connected is as follows:
Vertex 3 : Degree 2
Vertex 0 : Degree 2
Vertex 6 : Degree 2
Vertex 8 : Degree 2

Vertex 7 : Degree 3
Vertex 2 : Degree 3

Vertex 1 : Degree 4

Vertex 9 : Degree 5
Vertex 5 : Degree 6
Vertex 4 : Degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 3: <1, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 5): Forms triangles with vertices 7 and 9: <1, 5, 7> and <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (1, 7): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 5: <1, 9, 5>.
- Edge (2, 8): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (3, 4): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (3, 7): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 5, 9>.
- Edge (5, 6): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (5, 7): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (5, 8): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (5, 9): No shared connections with other vertices.
- Edge (6, 9): No shared connections with other vertices.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 3>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 9, 5>, <4, 5, 9>, <2, 8, 5>
