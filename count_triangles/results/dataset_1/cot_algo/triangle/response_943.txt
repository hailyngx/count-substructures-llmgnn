Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new vertex labels are:  
Node 8 has 0 connections  
Nodes 1 and 6 have 1 connection each  
Nodes 3, 7, and 4 have 2 connections each  
Nodes 0 and 5 have 4 connections each  
Node 2 has 5 connections  
Node 9 has 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph:

1. Considering edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share connections 4 and 2; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 4.
2. Considering edge (0, 3): No triangles are formed.
3. Considering edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share connection 4; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 7.
4. Considering edge (0, 5): Node 0 and Node 5 share connections 4 and 5; therefore, triangles are formed with Nodes 1 and 3.
5. Considering edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed.
6. Considering edge (1, 9): No triangles are formed.
7. Considering edge (2, 6): No triangles are formed.
8. Considering edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
9. Considering edge (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 share connections 5 and 9; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 4.
10. Considering edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share connection 5; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 0.
11. Considering edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
12. Considering edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 share connection 4; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 0.
13. Considering edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 share connection 5; therefore, a triangle is formed with Node 0.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <2, 4, 9>, and <5, 0, 9>.
