Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
3 (degree 0)
8 (degree 0)
10 (degree 0)
2 (degree 3)
4 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)

Now, considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2): Forms triangle with 4: <0, 2, 4>
(0, 4): No new triangles
(1, 4): No new triangles
(1, 7): No new triangles
(2, 5): No new triangles
(5, 6): No new triangles
(6, 7): Forms triangle with 7: <6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
