Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node 0
- Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 1
- Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 2
- Node 6 (3 connections) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 4
- Node 3 (3 connections) -> Node 5
- Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node 6
- Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 7
- Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node 8
- Node 1 (5 connections) -> Node 9

Now, let's examine the edges using the ordering of the nodes:

1. Edge between Node 2 (0) and Node 6 (3): No triangle formed.
2. Edge between Node 2 (0) and Node 7 (7): No triangle formed.
3. Edge between Node 4 (1) and Node 0 (8): Triangle formed with Node 7 (7) -> <7, 1, 8>.
4. Edge between Node 4 (1) and Node 1 (9): No triangle formed.
5. Edge between Node 5 (2) and Node 6 (3): No triangle formed.
6. Edge between Node 5 (2) and Node 8 (4): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <7, 1, 8>.
