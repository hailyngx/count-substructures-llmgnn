Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we assign new labels to them as follows:
Node 7 -> 0 connections
Node 6 -> 1 connection
Node 4 -> 1 connection
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 9 -> 3 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 1 -> 4 connections
Node 2 -> 5 connections
Node 0 -> 5 connections

Calculating the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2): Node 2 has 5 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections. They share nodes 1 and 8. Triangle <0, 2, 1>.
2. For edge (0, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections which is less than Node 0's 5 connections. They share node 9. Triangle <0, 3, 9>.
3. For edge (0, 4): Node 4 has 1 connection which is less than Node 0's 5 connections. They share node 8. Triangle <0, 4, 8>.
4. For edge (0, 9): Node 9 has 3 connections which is less than Node 0's 5 connections. They share node 3. Triangle <0, 9, 3>.
5. For edge (1, 2): Node 2 has 5 connections and Node 1 has 4 connections. They share nodes 0, 8, and 9. Triangles <1, 2, 0>, <1, 2, 8>, and <1, 2, 9>.
6. For edge (1, 6): Node 6 has 1 connection which is less than Node 1's 4 connections. They share node 5. Triangle <1, 6, 5>.
7. For edge (1, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 1's 4 connections. They share node 0. Triangle <1, 8, 0>.
8. For edge (1, 9): Node 9 has 3 connections which is less than Node 1's 4 connections. They share node 0. Triangle <1, 9, 0>.
9. For edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections which is less than Node 2's 5 connections. They share node 3. Triangle <2, 5, 3>.
10. For edge (2, 7): Node 7 has 0 connections which is less than Node 2's 5 connections. No triangle.
11. For edge (2, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 2's 5 connections. They share nodes 0 and 1. Triangles <2, 8, 0> and <2, 8, 1>.
12. For edge (3, 5): Node 5 has 2 connections which is less than Node 3's 2 connections. They share node 2. Triangle <3, 5, 2>.
13. For edge (3, 9): Node 9 has 3 connections which is less than Node 3's 2 connections. They share node 0. Triangle <3, 9, 0>.
14. For edge (4, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 4's 1 connection. They share node 0. Triangle <4, 8, 0>.
15. For edge (5, 6): Node 6 has 1 connection which is less than Node 5's 2 connections. They share node 1. Triangle <5, 6, 1>.

Therefore, there are a total of 15 triangles in the graph:
