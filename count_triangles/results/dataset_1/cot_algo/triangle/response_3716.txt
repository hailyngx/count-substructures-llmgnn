Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then we relabel the vertices based on this ordering. 

The vertex degrees are:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Therefore, the new vertex ordering is: 2, 6, 0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 8

Now, we go through each edge following the condition that we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles are formed between vertices sharing a connection. 
Calculating the number of triangles results in 10 triangles:
