Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:  
Node 0: 1 edge  
Node 2: 1 edge  
Node 3: 1 edge  
Node 4: 0 edges  
Node 6: 2 edges  
Node 9: 2 edges  
Node 5: 3 edges  
Node 7: 4 edges  
Node 1: 6 edges  
Node 8: 7 edges  

Relabel the vertices according to their degree in ascending order:  
Node 0 -> Node 0   
Node 2 -> Node 1  
Node 3 -> Node 2  
Node 4 -> Node 3  
Node 6 -> Node 4  
Node 9 -> Node 5  
Node 5 -> Node 6  
Node 7 -> Node 7  
Node 1 -> Node 8  
Node 8 -> Node 9  

Now, check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 8): Node 0 has 1 connection, Node 8 has 7 connections. No triangle.
(1, 5): Node 8 and Node 6 have a connection which forms a triangle: <1, 5, 8>.
(1, 7): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(1, 8): Node 8 has more connections than Node 1. No triangle.
(1, 9): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(2, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 8 which forms a triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
(3, 9): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(5, 1): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(5, 6): Node 8 and Node 6 have a shared connection which forms a triangle: <5, 6, 8>.
(6, 8): Node 6 has fewer connections. No triangle.
(7, 1): Node 1 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 8 which forms a triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
(7, 2): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(7, 8): Node 1 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 8 which forms a triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
(8, 0): Node 0 has 1 connection, Node 8 has 7 connections. No triangle.
(8, 1): Node 1 has 6 connections, Node 8 has 7 connections. No triangle.
(8, 5): Node 8 and Node 6 have a shared connection which forms a triangle: <5, 6, 8>.
(8, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections. No triangle.
(8, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 have a shared connection with Node 8 which forms a triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
(9, 1): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.
(9, 3): No triangle as both nodes have more connections.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <1, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 8>.
