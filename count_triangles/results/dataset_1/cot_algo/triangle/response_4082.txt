Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in order:
0 (degree 2)
7 (degree 1)
2 (degree 2)
5 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
8 (degree 5)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 5)
9 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degree, with the lowest degree receiving the lowest label. The new labels are:
0 ➔ 0
7 ➔ 1
2 ➔ 2
5 ➔ 3
1 ➔ 4
8 ➔ 5
4 ➔ 3
6 ➔ 5
9 ➔ 5
3 ➔ 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

Based on the sorted list of edges, we see that triangles can be formed in the following combinations:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
