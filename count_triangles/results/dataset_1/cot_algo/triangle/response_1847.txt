Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices are relabeled as follows: 

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The triangles in the graph are: 
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 5, 2>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
