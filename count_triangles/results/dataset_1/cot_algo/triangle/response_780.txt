Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3 with degree 2
- Node 0, 4, 7 with degree 3
- Node 1, 9 with degree 4
- Node 6 with degree 5
- Node 2, 5, 8 with degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:

1. Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with node 1 <0, 1, 2>
2. Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 2>
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed
4. Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with node 5 <5, 1, 9>
5. Edge (2, 0): Forms a triangle with node 1 <0, 1, 2>
6. Edge (2, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 2>
7. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed
8. Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed
9. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed
10. Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1 <5, 1, 9>
11. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed
12. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle with node 9 <6, 7, 9>
13. Edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle with node 1 <6, 1, 8>
14. Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle with node 9 <6, 7, 9>
15. Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle with node 1 <6, 1, 9>
16. Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 8>
17. Edge (8, 6): Forms a triangle with node 1 <6, 1, 8>
18. Edge (9, 1): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 1, 9>
19. Edge (9, 5): Forms a triangle with node 1 <5, 1, 9>
20. Edge (9, 7): Forms a triangle with node 1 <6, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
