Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows: 

1. Node 0 - degree 3
2. Node 4 - degree 1
3. Node 6 - degree 1
4. Node 7 - degree 1
5. Node 1 - degree 2
6. Node 2 - degree 2
7. Node 5 - degree 2
8. Node 9 - degree 3
9. Node 8 - degree 7
10. Node 3 - degree 4

Now, we can loop through the edges and count the number of triangles formed. 
Starting with the edge (0, 1): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 1, so we check for shared connections. Nodes 0 and 1 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle. 

Moving to the next edge and so on, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<8, 4, 6>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
<8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
