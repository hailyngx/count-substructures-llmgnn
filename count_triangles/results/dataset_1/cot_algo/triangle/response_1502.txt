Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows: 
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge to count triangles.  

We find the following triangles: 
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
