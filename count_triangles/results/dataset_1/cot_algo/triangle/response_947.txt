Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degree:

0 - 3 connections  
1 - 6 connections  
2 - 4 connections  
3 - 4 connections  
4 - 7 connections  
5 - 6 connections  
6 - 3 connections  
7 - 3 connections  
8 - 4 connections  
9 - 6 connections  

Starting with the edge with the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection 4 => <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2 => <1, 2, 5>
5. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2 => <1, 2, 9>
7. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5 => <2, 4, 5>
8. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 => <1, 2, 9>
11. Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9 => <3, 4, 9>
12. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.

[Total number of triangles: 5]<0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>
