Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 46 edges, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. Let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 5: 2 edges
Vertex 1: 3 edges
Vertex 3: 3 edges
Vertex 4: 4 edges
Vertex 6: 4 edges
Vertex 0: 7 edges
Vertex 7: 7 edges
Vertex 2: 8 edges
Vertex 8: 8 edges
Vertex 9: 9 edges

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 5 -> Node 0
Node 1 -> Node 1
Node 3 -> Node 2
Node 4 -> Node 3
Node 6 -> Node 4
Node 0 -> Node 5
Node 7 -> Node 6
Node 2 -> Node 7
Node 8 -> Node 8
Node 9 -> Node 9

Next, we will check for triangles using only the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1) - forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <0, 1, 7>
2. Edge (0, 2) - doesn't form a triangle because vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 2.
3. Edge (0, 3) - forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <0, 3, 6>
4. Edge (0, 6) - doesn't form a triangle because vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 6.
5. Edge (0, 7) - forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 7, 1>
6. Edge (0, 8) - forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 8, 3>
7. Edge (0, 9) - forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 9, 6>
8. Edge (1, 8) - doesn't form a triangle because vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 8.
9. Edge (2, 8) - doesn't form a triangle because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 8.
10. Edge (3, 6) - forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <3, 6, 0>
11. Edge (7, 8) - forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <7, 8, 0>
12. Edge (7, 9) - forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
