Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following new labels:
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 9 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 3)
Node 8 (degree 3)
Node 4 (degree 3)
Node 7 (degree 5)
Node 2 (degree 6)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle 2: <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle 3: <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle 5: <3, 4, 7>
- Triangle 6: <3, 7, 8>
- Triangle 7: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 8: <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
