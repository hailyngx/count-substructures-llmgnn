Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges:

Nodes sorted by number of connections (degree):
0: 1 connection
2: 0 connections
5: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
2: 0 connections
9: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 2 connections
4: 5 connections
1: 5 connections

Based on the connections between nodes, the triangles found are:
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 4>

Total number of triangles: [5]
