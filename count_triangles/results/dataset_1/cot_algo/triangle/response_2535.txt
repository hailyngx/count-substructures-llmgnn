Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following labels for each vertex:
Node 8 (0 connections): 9
Node 2 (1 connection): 0
Node 0 (1 connection): 2
Node 9 (1 connection): 3
Node 7 (2 connections): 1
Node 5 (3 connections): 7
Node 6 (3 connections): 4
Node 3 (3 connections): 5
Node 1 (4 connections): 6
Node 4 (4 connections): 8

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the following triangles:
