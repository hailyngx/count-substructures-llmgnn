Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 2: 0 edge
Node 1: 1 edge
Node 3: 1 edge
Node 8: 1 edge
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 0: 5 edges

Now, we can relabel the nodes:
Node 2 (degree 0) -> Node 0
Node 1 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 2
Node 8 (degree 1) -> Node 3
Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 6
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 0 (degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
The edges we will examine are: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 5), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 9).

Let's count the triangles formed by these edges:
1. Triangle: <0, 4, 6> 
2. Triangle: <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle: <0, 7, 9>
4. Triangle: <1, 5, 9>
5. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
6. Triangle: <5, 6, 9>
7. Triangle: <5, 7, 9>
8. Triangle: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
