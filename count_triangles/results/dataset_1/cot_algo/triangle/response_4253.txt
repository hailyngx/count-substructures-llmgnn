Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes along with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1

Now, we will reorder the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes [0, 1, 7] -> Nodes [3, 4, 5, 6] -> Nodes [2]

Next, we will examine each edge based on the reordered nodes:

Edge (0, 1): Both nodes 0 and 1 have 1 connection each, so we proceed
Edge (2, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 2, so we proceed
Edge (2, 5): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 2, so we proceed
Edge (2, 7): Node 7 has fewer connections than node 2, so we proceed
Edge (3, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 3, so we proceed
Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 4, so we proceed
Edge (5, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections than node 5, so we proceed

Now, we check for triangles formed by shared connections:
Triangular relationships:
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] as shown above.
