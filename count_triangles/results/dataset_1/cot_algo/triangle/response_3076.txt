Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 6 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Analyzing edge (0, 2) since 0 is less than 2: They share a connection with vertex 5 forming the triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Analyzing edge (0, 5) since 0 is less than 5: They share a connection with vertex 2 forming the triangle <0, 5, 2>.
- Analyzing edge (0, 8) since 0 is less than 8: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (1, 6) since 1 is less than 6: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (1, 7) since 1 is less than 7: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (2, 0) since 0 is less than 2: They share a connection with vertex 5 forming the triangle <2, 0, 5>.
- Analyzing edge (3, 6) since 3 is less than 6: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <3, 6, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (3, 7) since 3 is less than 7: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <3, 7, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (3, 9) since 3 is less than 9: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <3, 9, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (4, 6) since 4 is less than 6: They share a connection with vertices 3 and 7 forming the triangles <4, 6, 3> and <4, 6, 7>.
- Analyzing edge (4, 7) since 4 is less than 7: They share a connection with vertex 3 forming the triangle <4, 7, 3>.
- Analyzing edge (5, 0) since 0 is less than 5: They share a connection with vertex 2 forming the triangle <5, 0, 2>.
- Analyzing edge (5, 6) since 5 is less than 6: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (6, 1) since 1 is less than 6: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (6, 3) since 3 is less than 6: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <6, 3, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (6, 4) since 4 is less than 6: They share a connection with vertices 3 and 7 forming the triangles <6, 4, 3> and <6, 4, 7>.
- Analyzing edge (6, 5) since 5 is less than 6: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (7, 1) since 1 is less than 7: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (7, 3) since 3 is less than 7: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <7, 3, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (7, 4) since 4 is less than 7: They share a connection with vertex 3 forming the triangle <7, 4, 3>.
- Analyzing edge (8, 0) since 0 is less than 8: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (8, 9) since 8 is less than 9: No triangle formed.
- Analyzing edge (9, 3) since 3 is less than 9: They share a connection with vertex 4 forming the triangle <9, 3, 4>.
- Analyzing edge (9, 4) since 4 is less than 9: They share a connection with vertices 3 and 7 forming the triangles <9, 4, 3> and <9, 4, 7>.

The total number of triangles is [12], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 4>, <4, 6, 3>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 3>, <5, 0, 2>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 4, 3>, <6, 4, 7>, <9, 3, 4>.
