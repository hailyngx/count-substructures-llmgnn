Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are: 

Node 3: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 6  
Node 8: degree 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking the (0, 5) edge: Both 0 and 5 share connections with 7 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 7, 8>.  
Checking the (0, 7) edge: Both 0 and 7 share connections with 5 and 8, forming a triangle <0, 5, 8>.  
Checking the (0, 8) edge: Both 0 and 8 share connections with 5 and 7, forming a triangle <0, 5, 7>.  
Checking the (1, 6) edge: Both 1 and 6 share a connection with 8, forming a triangle <1, 8, 6>.  
Checking the (1, 8) edge: Both 1 and 8 share connections with 6, 0, and 9, forming triangles <1, 6, 0> and <1, 0, 9>.  
Checking the (1, 9) edge: Both 1 and 9 share a connection with 0, forming a triangle <1, 0, 9>.  
Checking the (2, 7) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (2, 8) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (3, 4) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (3, 8) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (4, 3) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (4, 7) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (5, 0) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (5, 7) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (5, 8) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (5, 9) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (6, 1) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (6, 8) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (6, 9) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (7, 0) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (7, 2) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (7, 4) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (7, 5) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 0) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 1) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 2) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 3) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 5) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (8, 6) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (9, 1) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (9, 5) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  
Checking the (9, 6) edge: Proceed to the next edge.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 0, 9>.
