Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees. The sorted vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:

Vertex 3: Degree 1
Vertex 1: Degree 1
Vertex 4: Degree 1
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertex 9: Degree 1
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 6: Degree 0
Vertex 0: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge based on the degree order and count the triangles:

1. Edge (3, 9):
   - Both vertices 3 and 9 have degree 1.
   - No triangle formed.

2. Edge (1, 0):
   - Vertex 1 has degree 1, and vertex 0 has degree 4.
   - Check for shared connections: Vertex 1 has a connection with vertex 0 (forming triangle 1-0-5).

3. Edge (4, 2):
   - Both vertices 4 and 2 have degree 1.
   - No triangle formed.

4. Edge (5, 0):
   - Vertex 5 has degree 1, and vertex 0 has degree 4.
   - Check for shared connections: Vertex 5 has a connection with vertex 0 (forming triangle 5-0-8).

5. Edge (7, 2):
   - Vertex 7 has degree 2, and vertex 2 has degree 2.
   - Check for shared connections: Vertex 7 and vertex 2 have a shared connection with vertex 4 (forming triangle 7-2-4).

6. Edge (7, 8):
   - Vertex 7 has degree 2, and vertex 8 has degree 4.
   - Check for shared connections: Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 2 and 8, forming two triangles - 7-2-8 and 7-8-0.

7. Edge (8, 0):
   - Vertex 8 has degree 4, and vertex 0 has degree 4.
   - Check for shared connections: Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 0 and 7, forming triangle 8-0-7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <1, 0, 5>, <5, 0, 8>, <7, 2, 4>, and <7, 8, 0>.
