Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 0: 0 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections

Next, we will count the triangles by examining the edges and checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
1. <1, 3, 7>
2. <1, 3, 8>
3. <1, 7, 8>
4. <3, 7, 8>

Now, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
