Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree 2), 7 (degree 1), 9 (degree 2), 1 (degree 3), 5 (degree 4), 8 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 6 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5)

Now, we relabel the vertices based on this order:
Node 0 -> Node A
Node 7 -> Node B
Node 9 -> Node C
Node 1 -> Node D
Node 5 -> Node E
Node 8 -> Node F
Node 4 -> Node G
Node 6 -> Node H
Node 3 -> Node I
Node 2 -> Node J

Now, we will count the triangles using the given edges:

Triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 12]
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 8>
