Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new numbering is:
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles and provide the unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
