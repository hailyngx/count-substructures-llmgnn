Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree of connections:

Vertex 0 has degree 5.
Vertex 1 has degree 3.
Vertex 2 has degree 4.
Vertex 3 has degree 4.
Vertex 4 has degree 6.
Vertex 5 has degree 3.
Vertex 6 has degree 3.
Vertex 7 has degree 3.
Vertex 8 has degree 4.
Vertex 9 has degree 5.

Vertices in order of degree: 1, 5, 6, 7, 3, 2, 8, 0, 9, 4.

Now we proceed with the edges in the same order:

1. (1, 3): No triangles formed.
2. (5, 2): No triangles formed.
3. (6, 4): No triangles formed.
4. (7, 4): No triangles formed.
5. (3, 2): No triangles formed.
6. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
7. (8, 0): Triangle <0, 8, 2>.
8. (0, 9): No triangles formed.
9. (9, 4): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 8, 2>.
