Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 6
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
- Vertex 3 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 2 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 6 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 8 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 1 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 9 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 5 (Degree 6) -> Vertex 9

After relabeling, the edges are:
(3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:
- <0, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
