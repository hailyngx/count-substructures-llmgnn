Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 1
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Nodes 0, 1, 3 have degree 4
Nodes 4, 5, 7 have degree 5
Nodes 6, 9 have degree 6

Now, we will start counting triangles based on the given edges, only proceeding if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
