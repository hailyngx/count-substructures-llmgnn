Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 9 has degree 1
- Vertices 2 and 4 have degree 2
- Vertices 0, 5, and 8 have degree 3
- Vertices 3 and 8 have degree 4
- Vertices 1 and 6 have degree 6
- Vertex 7 has degree 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections:

- Vertex 9 (Degree 1)
- Vertices 2 and 4 (Degree 2)
- Vertices 0, 5, and 8 (Degree 3)
- Vertices 3 and 7 (Degree 4)
- Vertices 1 and 6 (Degree 6)

Next, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
