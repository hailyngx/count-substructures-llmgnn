Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 2, 8 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 6 have 5 connections each.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>

Based on these triangles, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
