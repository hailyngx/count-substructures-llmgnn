Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices: 3, 6, 9, 1, 7, 0, 4, 8, 5, 2

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
3 -> 0
6 -> 1
9 -> 2
1 -> 3
7 -> 4
0 -> 5
4 -> 6
8 -> 7
5 -> 8
2 -> 9

Next, we'll go through each edge and check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering method. We ignore edges where the vertex with the lower label has more connections.

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<2, 4, 8>

Finally, we calculate the total number of triangles:
