Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 3: degree 2
Nodes 4 and 6: degree 3
Nodes 7 and 2: degree 4
Nodes 5 and 9: degree 5
Nodes 1 and 8: degree 6
Node 0: degree 8

Now we relabel the nodes in increasing order of their degrees:

Node 3: label 0
Nodes 4 and 6: label 1
Nodes 7 and 2: label 2
Nodes 5 and 9: label 3
Nodes 1 and 8: label 4
Node 0: label 5

Next, we need to count the triangles. Since we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles as follows:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 3>
<9, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
