Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node 0 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4

After sorting according to degrees, the new labels will be:
Node 1 (degree 2) -> 0
Node 4 (degree 2) -> 1
Node 6 (degree 2) -> 2
Node 7 (degree 3) -> 3
Node 2 (degree 3) -> 4
Node 8 (degree 4) -> 5
Node 0 (degree 4) -> 6
Node 3 (degree 4) -> 7
Node 5 (degree 4) -> 8
Node 9 (degree 4) -> 9

Now, we will go through the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 1 has connections with Node 0, forming a triangle with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (0, 3): Node 3 has connections with Node 0 and Node 9, forming a triangle with Node 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
3. Edge (0, 5): Node 5 has connections with Node 0 and 9, forming a triangle with Node 3. Triangle: <0, 5, 3>
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 9): Node 9 has connections with Node 2 and 3, forming a triangle with Node 5. Triangle: <2, 9, 5>
8. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 9): Node 9 has connections with Node 3 and 5, forming a triangle with Node 2. Triangle: <3, 9, 2>
11. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 9): Node 9 has connections with Node 5, 2, and 3, forming triangles with Node 0 and Node 3. Triangles: <5, 9, 0> and <5, 9, 3>
14. Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (8, 9): Node 9 has connections with Node 8, 2, and 3, forming triangles with Node 0, Node 5, and Node 3. Triangles: <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 5>, and <8, 9, 3>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
