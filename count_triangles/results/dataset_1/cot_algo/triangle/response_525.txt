Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 2
2: degree 1
3: degree 2
4: degree 2
5: degree 2
6: degree 4
7: degree 4
8: degree 2
9: degree 2

Now, we start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
(0, 4): Check for shared connections: (0, 4, 6) - <0, 4, 6>
(0, 5): No triangle formed
(0, 7): Check for shared connections: (0, 7, 1) - <0, 7, 1>
(0, 9): No triangle formed
(1, 3): No triangle formed
(1, 6): No triangle formed
(1, 7): Check for shared connections: (1, 7, 5) - <1, 7, 5>
(2, 9): No triangle formed
(3, 6): No triangle formed
(4, 6): Check for shared connections: (4, 6, 1) - <4, 6, 1>
(5, 7): Check for shared connections: (5, 7, 0) - <5, 7, 0>
(6, 8): No triangle formed
(7, 8): No triangle formed

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 7, 1>, and <5, 7, 0>.
