Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in a graph efficiently. 

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new ordering of the vertices is: 
Node 5: degree 2
Nodes 9, 3: degree 1
Nodes 2, 7, 4: degree 3
Nodes 0, 1, 8, 6: degree 4

Following the rules of the Degree-Based Ordering method, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing these edges: 
- Edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections of node 0 and node 1. Shared connections: 6
- Edge (0, 4): Check for shared connections of node 0 and node 4. Shared connections: 6
- Edge (0, 6): Check for shared connections of node 0 and node 6. Shared connections: None
- Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections of node 0 and node 8. Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 2): Check for shared connections of node 1 and node 2. Shared connections: 6
- Edge (1, 3): Check for shared connections of node 1 and node 3. Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 4): Check for shared connections of node 2 and node 4. Shared connections: 6
- Edge (2, 6): Check for shared connections of node 2 and node 6. Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 7): Check for shared connections of node 2 and node 7. Shared connections: None
- Edge (4, 6): Check for shared connections of node 4 and node 6. Shared connections: None

Thus, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>.
