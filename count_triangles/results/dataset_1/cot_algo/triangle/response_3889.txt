Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Degree-Based Ordering:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Sorted nodes:
1, 3, 0, 7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 4

Triangles:
[7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <7, 5, 9>.
