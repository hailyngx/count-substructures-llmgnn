Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees from least to most connections:

Nodes with connections:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 6: 8 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3 (1 connection) --> Node 1
Node 8 (1 connection) --> Node 2
Node 1 (2 connections) --> Node 3
Node 2 (2 connections) --> Node 4
Node 7 (2 connections) --> Node 5
Node 4 (3 connections) --> Node 6
Node 9 (3 connections) --> Node 7
Node 0 (3 connections) --> Node 8
Node 5 (6 connections) --> Node 9
Node 6 (8 connections) --> Node 10

Now, we will analyze the edges by considering the lower labeled vertex:

(0, 5) - Proceed
(0, 6) - Proceed
(0, 8) - Proceed
(1, 2) - Proceed
(1, 6) - Proceed
(2, 6) - Proceed
(3, 4) - Proceed
(4, 5) - Proceed
(4, 6) - Proceed
(5, 7) - Skip (Node 7 is higher labeled than Node 5)
(6, 9) - Proceed
(7, 9) - Proceed

Now, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
