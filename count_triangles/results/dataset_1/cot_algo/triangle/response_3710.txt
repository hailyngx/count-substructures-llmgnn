Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

0 (degree 1) <br>
2 (degree 1) <br>
5 (degree 1) <br>
9 (degree 2) <br>
5 (degree 2) <br>
3 (degree 2) <br>
0 (degree 3) <br>
6 (degree 3) <br>
9 (degree 4) <br>
4 (degree 5) <br>

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

0 and 7 cannot form a triangle as 0 has fewer connections than 7. <br>
1 and 4 cannot form a triangle as 1 has fewer connections than 4. <br>
1 and 5 cannot form a triangle as 1 has fewer connections than 5. <br>
1 and 6 cannot form a triangle as 1 has fewer connections than 6. <br>
1 and 9 can form a triangle with 8. (1, 9, 8) <br>
2 and 3 cannot form a triangle as 2 has fewer connections than 3. <br>
3 and 2 cannot form a triangle as 3 has fewer connections than 2. <br>
3 and 8 can form a triangle with 6. (3, 8, 6) <br>
4 and 1 cannot form a triangle as 4 has fewer connections than 1. <br>
4 and 6 cannot form a triangle as 4 has fewer connections than 6. <br>
4 and 7 can form a triangle with 8. (4, 7, 8) <br>
5 and 1 cannot form a triangle as 5 has fewer connections than 1. <br>
6 and 1 can form a triangle with 8. (6, 1, 8) <br>
6 and 4 can form a triangle with 7. (6, 4, 7) <br>
6 and 8 can form a triangle with 3. (6, 8, 3) <br>
7 and 0 cannot form a triangle as 7 has fewer connections than 0. <br>
7 and 4 can form a triangle with 8. (7, 4, 8) <br>
8 and 3 can form a triangle with 6. (8, 3, 6) <br>
8 and 6 can form a triangle with 4. (8, 6, 4) <br>
8 and 7 can form a triangle with 4. (8, 7, 4) <br>
8 and 9 can form a triangle with 1. (8, 9, 1) <br>
9 and 1 cannot form a triangle as 9 has fewer connections than 1. <br>
9 and 8 can form a triangle with 1. (9, 8, 1) <br>

The total number of triangles is [7] <br>
The unique triangles found are: <br>
<1, 9, 8> <br>
<4, 7, 8> <br>
<6, 1, 8> <br>
<6, 4, 7> <br>
<6, 8, 3> <br>
<7, 4, 8> <br>
<8, 9, 1> <br>
