Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5>
2. <0, 4, 9>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <2, 0, 5>
5. <3, 0, 4>
6. <4, 7, 1>
7. <4, 7, 9>
8. <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
