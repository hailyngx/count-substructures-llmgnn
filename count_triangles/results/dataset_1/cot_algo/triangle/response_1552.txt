Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
0 (degree 5)
1 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles: 

1. Edge (5, 0):
   No triangles formed.

2. Edge (5, 6):
   No triangles formed.

3. Edge (2, 4):
   Triangle <2, 4, 0> found.

4. Edge (1, 6):
   No triangles formed.

5. Edge (6, 2):
   Triangle <6, 2, 4> found.

6. Edge (6, 3):
   Triangle <6, 3, 4> found.

7. Edge (6, 5):
   No triangles formed.

8. Edge (7, 0):
   Triangle <7, 0, 4> found.

9. Edge (8, 0):
   No triangles formed.

10. Edge (8, 2):
    Triangle <8, 2, 4> found.

11. Edge (8, 3):
    Triangle <8, 3, 4> found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
