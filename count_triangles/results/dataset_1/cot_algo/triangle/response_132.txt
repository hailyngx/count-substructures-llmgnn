Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 1 (degree 0): 7 connections
- Vertex 3 (degree 0): 2 connections
- Vertex 8 (degree 0): 3 connections
- Vertex 0 (degree 1): 3 connections
- Vertex 2 (degree 2): 3 connections
- Vertex 5 (degree 2): 4 connections
- Vertex 6 (degree 4): 6 connections
- Vertex 4 (degree 5): 7 connections
- Vertex 9 (degree 7): 7 connections
- Vertex 7 (degree 7): 6 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

Total number of triangles: [14]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 9, 1>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 9, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 6, 4>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 8, 6>
<8, 7, 6>
