Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 8)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 6)
- (2, 5)
- (3, 4)
- (3, 6)
- (3, 9)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 8)
- (5, 9)
- (7, 8)

By checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
- <1, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
