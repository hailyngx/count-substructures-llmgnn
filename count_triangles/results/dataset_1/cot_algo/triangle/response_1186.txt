Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections each vertex has:
- Vertex 0: 5 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Next, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices in ascending order: 9, 1, 8, 3, 2, 5, 7, 4, 0

Now, we will go through the edges in the graph and count the triangles:
Edges to consider based on the degree-based ordering: (9, 5) (1, 5) (8, 1)

Calculating the triangles:
1. (9, 5): Both vertices have a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 5, 9>.
2. (1, 5): Both vertices have a connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
3. (8, 1): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
