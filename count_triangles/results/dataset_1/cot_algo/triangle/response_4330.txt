Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will now be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 7
- Node 8: degree = 1
- Node 9: degree = 2

2. Sort nodes by degree in ascending order and relabel:
- Node 2: degree = 1 -> Relabel as Node 0
- Node 8: degree = 1 -> Relabel as Node 1
- Node 1: degree = 2 -> Relabel as Node 2
- Node 9: degree = 2 -> Relabel as Node 3
- Node 4: degree = 4 -> Relabel as Node 4
- Node 5: degree = 4 -> Relabel as Node 5
- Node 6: degree = 4 -> Relabel as Node 6
- Node 0: degree = 5 -> Relabel as Node 7
- Node 7: degree = 7 -> Relabel as Node 8

3. Count triangles:
- (0, 4): Shared connections with 7 -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>
- (0, 5): Shared connections with 7 -> Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
- (0, 6): Shared connections with 7 -> Triangle formed: <0, 6, 7>
- (0, 7): Shared connections with 4, 5, 6 -> Triangles formed: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>
- (0, 9): No triangle formed
- (1, 6): No triangle formed
- (1, 9): No triangle formed
- (2, 7): No triangle formed
- (4, 5): Shared connection with 7 -> Triangle formed: <4, 5, 7>
- (4, 7): Shared connection with 0, 5 -> Triangle formed: <0, 4, 7>, <4, 5, 7>
- (5, 6): Shared connection with 7 -> Triangle formed: <5, 6, 7>
- (5, 7): Shared connections with 0, 4, 6 -> Triangles formed: <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
- (6, 7): Shared connections with 0, 5 -> Triangles formed: <0, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 7>
- (7, 8): Shared connections with 0 -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>

4. Total number of triangles: [6]
   
Output: The total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
