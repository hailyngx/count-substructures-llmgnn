Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex order is: 0, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 6.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. Edge (0, 4): Check shared connections for vertices 0 and 4. No triangles formed.
2. Edge (1, 3): Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 3. Formed triangle <1, 3, 6>.
3. Edge (1, 4): Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 4. No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 7. No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections for vertices 1 and 9. No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 6): Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 6. Formed triangle <2, 6, 8>.
7. Edge (2, 8): Check shared connections for vertices 2 and 8. No triangles formed.
8. Edge (3, 6): Check shared connections for vertices 3 and 6. Formed triangle <1, 3, 6> (already counted).
9. Edge (3, 9): Check shared connections for vertices 3 and 9. No triangles formed.
10. Edge (6, 2): Check shared connections for vertices 6 and 2. Formed triangle <2, 6, 8> (already counted).
11. Edge (6, 8): Check shared connections for vertices 6 and 8. Formed triangle <2, 6, 8> (already counted).
12. Edges with higher labeled vertices are not considered.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [2], and the unique triangles found inside <> are <1, 3, 6> and <2, 6, 8>.
