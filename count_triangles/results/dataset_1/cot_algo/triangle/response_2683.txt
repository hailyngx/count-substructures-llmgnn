Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

0: 1 connection
1: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
2: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, let's list the triangles we find:
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
