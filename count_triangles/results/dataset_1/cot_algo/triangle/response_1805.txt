Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the nodes are sorted based on their connections as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 7 connections
Node 2: 8 connections

Now, we will consider the edges according to the sorting of nodes:
(0, 2) - 2 and 8 share 1 connection: <0, 2, 8>
(0, 3) - 0 and 7 share 1 connection: <0, 3, 7>
(0, 7) - 0 and 3 share 2 connections: <0, 3, 7>
(1, 3) - 1 and 5 share 0 connections
(1, 5) - 1 and 3 share 1 connection: <1, 3, 5>
(2, 3) - 2 and 3 share 3 connections: <2, 3, 7>
(2, 4) - 2 and 0 share 0 connections
(2, 7) - 2 and 0 share 1 connection: <0, 2, 7>
(2, 8) - 2 and 0 share 0 connections
(3, 5) - 3 and 1 share 1 connection: <1, 3, 5>
(3, 6) - 3 and 4 share 1 connection: <3, 4, 6>
(3, 7) - 3 and 0 share 2 connections: <0, 3, 7>
(4, 6) - 4 and 3 share 1 connection: <3, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <3, 4, 6>
