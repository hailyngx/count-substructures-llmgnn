Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Relabeling the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0 -> Node 5
Node 1 -> Node 7
Node 2 -> Node 9
Node 3 -> Node 4
Node 4 -> Node 2
Node 5 -> Node 0
Node 6 -> Node 8
Node 7 -> Node 1
Node 8 -> Node 3
Node 9 -> Node 6

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

Triangles: 
1. <0, 4, 5>
2. <0, 6, 8>
3. <1, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
