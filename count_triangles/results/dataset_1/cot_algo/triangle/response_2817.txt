Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 1
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 1
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 0 -> 0
- Vertex 1 -> 1
- Vertex 2 -> 2
- Vertex 3 -> 3
- Vertex 4 -> 4
- Vertex 6 -> 5
- Vertex 7 -> 6
- Vertex 8 -> 7
- Vertex 9 -> 8

Now, we look at each edge in the order specified and count the triangles:
1. Edge between 0 and 3: No triangles
2. Edge between 1 and 3: No triangles
3. Edge between 2 and 4: No triangles
4. Edge between 2 and 7: No triangles
5. Edge between 2 and 8: Triangle <2, 4, 7>
6. Edge between 3 and 0: No triangles
7. Edge between 3 and 1: No triangles
8. Edge between 3 and 4: No triangles
9. Edge between 3 and 9: No triangles
10. Edge between 4 and 2: No triangles
11. Edge between 4 and 3: No triangles
12. Edge between 4 and 7: No triangles
13. Edge between 6 and 8: No triangles
14. Edge between 7 and 2: No triangles
15. Edge between 7 and 4: No triangles
16. Edge between 7 and 8: No triangles
17. Edge between 8 and 2: No triangles
18. Edge between 8 and 6: No triangles
19. Edge between 8 and 7: No triangles
20. Edge between 9 and 3: No triangles

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 7>
