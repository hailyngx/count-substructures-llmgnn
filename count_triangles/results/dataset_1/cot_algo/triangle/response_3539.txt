Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 1(2), 4(0), 2(2), 5(2), 3(2), 6(2), 7(2), 0(4), 8(5), 9(4)

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 3, 6>
2. Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with node 5: <0, 5, 7>
3. Edge (0, 8) forms triangles with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>
4. Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with node 5: <0, 5, 9>
5. Edge (1, 2) does not form any triangles.
6. Edge (2, 1) does not form any triangles.
7. Edge (3, 6) does not form any triangles.
8. Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 8>
9. Edge (4, 8) does not form any triangles.
10. Edge (5, 7) does not form any triangles.
11. Edge (5, 9) does not form any triangles.
12. Edge (6, 0) does not form any triangles.
13. Edge (6, 3) does not form any triangles.
14. Edge (7, 0) does not form any triangles.
15. Edge (7, 5) does not form any triangles.
16. Edge (8, 0) forms triangles with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>
17. Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 3, 8>
18. Edge (8, 4) does not form any triangles.
19. Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 8, 9>
20. Edge (9, 0) does not form any triangles.
21. Edge (9, 5) does not form any triangles.
22. Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 8, 9>.
