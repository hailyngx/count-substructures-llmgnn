Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeling:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 4 connections
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 5 has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges in the following order:
1. Edge: (0, 5) - OK
2. Edge: (1, 5) - OK
3. Edge: (1, 8) - OK
4. Edge: (2, 4) - OK
5. Edge: (2, 5) - OK, forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
6. Edge: (2, 7) - OK
7. Edge: (2, 8) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 8>
8. Edge: (2, 9) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 9>
9. Edge: (3, 7) - OK
10. Edge: (4, 2) - OK, forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
11. Edge: (4, 5) - OK, forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
12. Edge: (4, 9) - OK
13. Edge: (5, 0) - OK
14. Edge: (5, 1) - OK
15. Edge: (5, 2) - OK, forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
16. Edge: (5, 4) - OK, forms triangle <2, 4, 5>
17. Edge: (5, 8) - OK, forms triangle <2, 5, 8>
18. Edge: (6, 9) - OK
19. Edge: (7, 2) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 8>
20. Edge: (7, 3) - OK
21. Edge: (7, 8) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 8>
22. Edge: (7, 9) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 9>
23. Edge: (8, 1) - OK, forms triangle <1, 5, 8>
24. Edge: (8, 2) - OK, forms triangle <2, 5, 8>
25. Edge: (8, 5) - OK, forms triangle <2, 5, 8>
26. Edge: (9, 2) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 9>
27. Edge: (9, 4) - OK
28. Edge: (9, 6) - OK
29. Edge: (9, 7) - OK, forms triangle <2, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 9>
