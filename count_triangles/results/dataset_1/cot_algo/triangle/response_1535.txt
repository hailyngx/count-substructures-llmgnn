Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel them as follows:  
Node 3 (Degree 2)  
Node 1 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 0 (Degree 3)  
Node 2 (Degree 3)  
Node 7 (Degree 3)  
Node 6 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 4)  
Node 4 (Degree 6)  

Now, we can count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share Node 1 as a common connection. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 share Node 1 as a common connection. Triangle: <1, 4, 9>.
9. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 share Node 6 as a common connection. Triangle: <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <6, 8, 9>.
