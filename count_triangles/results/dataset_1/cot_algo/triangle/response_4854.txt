Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Then, we relabel the vertices and count the triangles based on the rules mentioned.

After sorting the vertices by their degree:
- Node 7 and Node 1 have degree 1.
- Node 8 and Node 4 have degree 2.
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 5 have degree 3.
- Node 3 and Node 9 have degree 4.
  
Now, we will relabel the nodes with these degrees accordingly:
- Node 7 (degree 1) is relabeled as Node 0.
- Node 1 (degree 1) is relabeled as Node 1.
- Node 8 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 2.
- Node 4 (degree 2) is relabeled as Node 3.
- Node 0 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 4.
- Node 6 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 5.
- Node 5 (degree 3) is relabeled as Node 6.
- Node 3 (degree 4) is relabeled as Node 7.
- Node 9 (degree 4) is relabeled as Node 8.

Now, we will analyze the edges according to the relabeled nodes:
- (4, 0) forms a triangle with (0, 6) since they share a common connection with Node 2.
- (6, 0) forms a triangle with (0, 4) since they share a common connection with Node 2.
- (6, 8) forms a triangle with (8, 9) since they share a common connection with Node 2.
- (8, 6) forms a triangle with (6, 9) since they share a common connection with Node 3.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <6, 8, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <6, 8, 9>.
