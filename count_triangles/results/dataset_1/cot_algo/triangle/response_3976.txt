Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. Let's first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 4
1: degree 1
2: degree 5
3: degree 3
4: degree 2
5: degree 5
6: degree 3
7: degree 1
8: degree 3
9: degree 3

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles:

- (0, 2):
  Shared connections: [3, 4, 8]
  Triangle: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 3, 8>
- (0, 3):
  Shared connections: [2, 5]
  Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
- (0, 4):
  Shared connections: [5]
  Triangle: <0, 5, 4>
- (0, 8):
  Shared connections: [5]
  Triangle: <0, 5, 8>
- (1, 5):
  No action (degree condition not met)
- (2, 3):
  Shared connections: [5]
  Triangle: <2, 5, 3>
- (2, 5):
  Shared connections: [3, 4, 6, 8]
  Triangle: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 8>
- (2, 7):
  No action (degree condition not met)
- (2, 9):
  No action (degree condition not met)
- (3, 5):
  Shared connections: [2]
  Triangle: <3, 2, 5>
- (4, 5):
  Shared connections: [0]
  Triangle: <4, 0, 5>
- (5, 6):
  Shared connections: [8]
  Triangle: <5, 8, 6>
- (5, 8):
  Shared connections: [0, 6]
  Triangle: <5, 0, 8>, <5, 6, 8>
- (6, 8):
  Shared connections: [5]
  Triangle: <6, 5, 8>
- (6, 9):
  No action (degree condition not met)

Thus, there are 13 triangles in the given graph:
[13]
