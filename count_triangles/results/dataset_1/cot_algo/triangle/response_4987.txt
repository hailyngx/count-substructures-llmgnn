Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:

0 -> 1 connections
1 -> 2 connections
6 -> 3 connections
8 -> 3 connections
9 -> 3 connections
3 -> 4 connections
2 -> 4 connections
4 -> 6 connections
7 -> 6 connections

Now, let's find and count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. (0, 7) - No triangles
2. (1, 4) - No triangles
3. (1, 6) - No triangles
4. (2, 3) - No triangles
5. (2, 4) - No triangles
6. (2, 9) - No triangles
7. (3, 4) - No triangles
8. (4, 1) - No triangles
9. (4, 2) - No triangles
10. (4, 3) - No triangles
11. (4, 7) - Triangle <3, 4, 7>
12. (4, 8) - No triangles
13. (6, 1) - No triangles
14. (6, 7) - Triangle <1, 6, 7>
15. (6, 8) - No triangles
16. (7, 0) - No triangles
17. (7, 4) - Triangle <4, 7, 3>
18. (7, 6) - Triangle <6, 7, 1>
19. (7, 8) - Triangle <7, 8, 4>
20. (7, 9) - No triangles
21. (8, 4) - Triangle <8, 4, 1>
22. (8, 6) - Triangle <6, 8, 7>
23. (8, 7) - Triangle <7, 8, 4>
24. (9, 2) - No triangles
25. (9, 7) - No triangles

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 4>, <8, 4, 1>
