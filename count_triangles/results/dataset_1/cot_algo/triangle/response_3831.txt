Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 
Node 0 has 1 connection. 
Node 1 has 1 connection. 
Node 6 has 1 connection. 
Node 3 has 2 connections. 
Node 6 has 2 connections. 
Node 8 has 3 connections. 
Node 4 has 4 connections. 
Node 7 has 4 connections. 
Node 2 has 5 connections. 
Node 9 has 5 connections. 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
