Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then relabel the vertices accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labels will be: 
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 5
Node 7 has degree 7

Now, we will go through each edge considering the lower labeled vertex first to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (3, 5): Triangle formed with node 7: <3, 5, 7>
6. Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (4, 3): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (5, 3): Triangle formed with node 7: <3, 5, 7>
11. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 7): Triangle formed with node 3: <3, 5, 7>
13. Edge (5, 8): Triangle formed with node 7: <5, 7, 8>
14. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 3): Triangle formed with node 5: <3, 5, 7>
17. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (7, 5): Triangle formed with node 3: <3, 5, 7>
19. Edge (7, 8): Triangle formed with node 5: <5, 7, 8>
20. Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (8, 5): Triangle formed with node 7: <5, 7, 8>
22. Edge (8, 7): Triangle formed with node 5: <5, 7, 8>
23. Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
24. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <3, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>.
