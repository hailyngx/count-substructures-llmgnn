Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Relabeling nodes:
Node 1 -> A(0)
Node 6 -> B(1)
Node 7 -> C(2)
Node 9 -> D(3)
Node 5 -> E(4)
Node 2 -> F(5)
Node 8 -> G(6)
Node 3 -> H(7)
Node 4 -> I(8)

Edges to consider in the order listed:
(A, F), (A, C), (F, B), (B, F), (H, I), (H, E), (I, H), (I, G), (I, D), (E, H), (E, B), (B, F), (B, E), (C, A), (C, G), (G, I), (G, C), (D, I)
