Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 3: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3 -> Node 0
Node 7 -> Node 1
Node 1 -> Node 2
Node 6 -> Node 3
Node 9 -> Node 4
Node 0 -> Node 5
Node 4 -> Node 6
Node 5 -> Node 7
Node 8 -> Node 8
Node 2 -> Node 9

Next, we will analyze the edges to find triangles:

- Edge (0, 2):
  - Node 0 has connections with Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9
  - Node 2 has connections with Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8
  - Since both Node 0 and Node 2 have fewer connections, we check for shared connections: Node 0 and Node 2 share Node 5 as a connection, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.

- Edge (0, 4):
  - Node 0 has connections with Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9
  - Node 4 has connections with Node 0, Node 8, and Node 9
  - Since both Node 0 and Node 4 have fewer connections, we check for shared connections: Node 0 and Node 4 share Node 9 as a connection, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.

- Edge (0, 9):
  - Node 0 and Node 9 already form a triangle with Node 4.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 9>
