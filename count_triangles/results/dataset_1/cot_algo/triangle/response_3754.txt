Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order of vertices is: 

Vertices: 
0 (degree 2)
4 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
9 (degree 3)
2 (degree 4)
5 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 3): Vertices 0 (degree 2) and 3 (degree 5) have a shared connection at vertex 5. <0, 3, 5>
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 (degree 5) and 3 (degree 5) have shared connections at vertices 0 and 8. <1, 3, 0> and <1, 3, 8>
5. Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (2, 5): Vertices 2 (degree 4) and 5 (degree 4) have shared connections at vertices 0 and 7. <2, 5, 0> and <2, 5, 7>
9. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 0): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (3, 8): Vertices 3 (degree 5) and 8 (degree 4) have a shared connection at vertex 7. <3, 8, 7>
13. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 7): Vertices 5 (degree 4) and 7 (degree 5) have a shared connection at vertex 8. <5, 7, 8>
18. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (7, 8): Vertices 7 (degree 5) and 8 (degree 4) have a shared connection at vertex 5. <7, 8, 5>
23. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
24. Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed.
25. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
27. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 0>, <1, 3, 8>, and <2, 5, 7>.
