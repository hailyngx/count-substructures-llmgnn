Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree: 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5, 0, 4, 9, 6

Triangles: [9]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>
