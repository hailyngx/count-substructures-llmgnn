Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Vertices: 3, 4, 7, 9, 2, 8, 0, 1, 5, 6

Number of connections for each vertex:
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
2: 3 connections
8: 0 connections
0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 6 connections

Calculating triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 (degree 2) has fewer connections, so proceed.
    Shared connection: 0
    Triangle found: <0, 3, 5>

- Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections, so proceed.
    Shared connection: 1
    Triangle found: <1, 4, 6>

- Edge (7, 6): Vertex 7 (degree 2) has fewer connections, so proceed.
    Shared connection: 5
    Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>

- Edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 (degree 2) has fewer connections, so proceed.
    No shared connection, no triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 7>
