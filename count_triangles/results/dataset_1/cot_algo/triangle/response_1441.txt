Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new order is:  
Node 1 (Degree 2): 5, 6  
Node 2 (Degree 3): 7, 8  
Node 3 (Degree 4): 1  
Node 4 (Degree 4): 0  
Node 5 (Degree 1): 9  
Node 6 (Degree 3): 2  
Node 7 (Degree 1): 4

Calculating the triangles based on the ordering specified:
- For edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 7> found.
- For edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
- For edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [1]
List of unique triangles: <1, 2, 7>
