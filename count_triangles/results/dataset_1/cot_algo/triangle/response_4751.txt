Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new vertex labels will be:
0 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
8 (degree 1)
4 (degree 1)
6 (degree 4)
9 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
5 (degree 5)
2 (degree 0)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 7, 0>
<1, 0, 5>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 5>
<5, 1, 9>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 5>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 3>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 9, 3>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [21].
