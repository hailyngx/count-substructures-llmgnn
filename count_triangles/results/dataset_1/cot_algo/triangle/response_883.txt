Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices:

0 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
1 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)
8 (degree 4)
2 (degree 4)
7 (degree 6)

We will now analyze each edge following the rules mentioned earlier to count the number of triangles. 

Edges between vertices with lower-degree labels:
(0, 7) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 3 => <0, 3, 7>
(0, 8) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 4 => <0, 4, 8>
(5, 6) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 7 => <5, 6, 7>
(4, 6) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 8 => <4, 6, 8>
(9, 8) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 6 => <6, 8, 9>
(2, 7) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 1 => <1, 2, 7>
(2, 9) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 7 => <2, 7, 9>
(7, 1) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 4 => <1, 4, 7>
(7, 3) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 2 => <2, 3, 7>
(7, 9) can form triangles with: 1 common neighbor 8 => <7, 8, 9>

Adding up the total number of triangles will give:

[10 triangles]
