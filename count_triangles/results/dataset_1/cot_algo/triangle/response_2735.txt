Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:  
Vertices: 4, 5, 7, 3 (degree: 0)  
Vertices: 1, 3 (degree: 1)  
Vertices: 8, 6, 3 (degree: 2)  
Vertices: 0, 9, 3 (degree: 3)  
Vertices: 2 (degree: 4)  

Next, relabel the vertices with the degrees in increasing order:  
Vertices: 4, 5, 7, 0 (degree: 0)  -> Relabeled as 0  
Vertices: 1, 3 (degree: 1)  -> Relabeled as 1, 2  
Vertices: 8, 6, 3 (degree: 2)  -> Relabeled as 3, 4, 5  
Vertices: 0, 9, 3 (degree: 3)  -> Relabeled as 6, 7, 8  
Vertices: 2 (degree: 4)  -> Relabeled as 9  

Now, let's consider the edges in the order specified in the question.  
The following triangles can be formed:  
1. <0, 2, 6>  
2. <1, 4, 8>  
3. <6, 7, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
