Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph proceeds as follows:

- List of nodes with their degrees:
    - Node 0: degree 5
    - Node 1: degree 2
    - Node 2: degree 3
    - Node 3: degree 1
    - Node 4: degree 3
    - Node 5: degree 4
    - Node 6: degree 3
    - Node 7: degree 6
    - Node 8: degree 5
    - Node 9: degree 3

- Vertices sorted by degree in ascending order:
    - Nodes 3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 5, 0, 8, 7

Using the degree-based ordering, we will proceed based on the given edges:

1. (3, 8) -> No triangles formed.
2. (1, 2) -> No triangles formed.
3. (2, 4) -> No triangles formed.
4. (4, 5) -> No triangles formed.
5. (2, 6) -> No triangles formed.
6. (0, 5) -> No triangles formed.
7. (0, 6) -> No triangles formed.
8. (5, 7) -> No triangles formed.
9. (0, 7) -> No triangles formed.
10. (4, 7) -> No triangles formed.
11. (6, 7) -> No triangles formed.
12. (7, 8) -> No triangles formed.
13. (7, 9) -> No triangles formed.
14. (0, 9) -> No triangles formed.
15. (0, 8) -> No triangles formed.
16. (5, 4) -> No triangles formed.
17. (6, 2) -> Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>.
18. (9, 6) -> No triangles formed.
19. (2, 1) -> No triangles formed.
20. (8, 7) -> Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8>.
21. (8, 1) -> No triangles formed.
22. (8, 5) -> No triangles formed.
23. (7, 4) -> No triangles formed.
24. (9, 7) -> No triangles formed.
25. (0, 3) -> No triangles formed.
26. (6, 0) -> No triangles formed.
27. (7, 5) -> No triangles formed.
28. (7, 0) -> No triangles formed.
29. (5, 0) -> No triangles formed.
30. (5, 8) -> Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>.
31. (4, 2) -> No triangles formed.
32. (0, 5) -> No triangles formed.
33. (9, 0) -> No triangles formed.
34. (7, 6) -> No triangles formed.
35. (8, 0) -> No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: 3
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 8>

Output: [3]
