Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:

0 (degree 2), 2 (degree 2), 8 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 1 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 5 (degree 4), 7 (degree 5), 3 (degree 6), 4 (degree 6)

Now, we will go through each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections and identify triangles:

- Edge (0, 3): Both 0 and 2 are connected to 3, forming triangle <0, 3, 2>.
- Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): Both 0 and 2 are connected to 3 and 4, forming triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (4, 5): Both 1 and 8 are connected to 4 and 5, forming triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 5>
