Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph:

After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, we get the following order: 
Node 0 -> Degree 0
Node 4 -> Degree 1
Node 5 -> Degree 2
Node 2 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 9 -> Degree 2
Node 3 -> Degree 3
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 3

Analyzing the edges as per the method:
- (0, 3) can form triangles with either (1, 3) or (3, 6). 
- (1, 3) can form a triangle with (3, 6).
- (1, 9) does not form any triangles as per the method.
- (2, 5) can form a triangle with (0, 3).
- (3, 0) is already considered with edge (0,3).
- (3, 1) can form a triangle with (6, 1).
- (3, 6) does not form any new triangles as per the method since 3 has higher degree than 6.
- (4, 8) does not form any triangles as per the method since 8 has higher degree than 4.
- (5, 2) can form a triangle with (0, 3).
- (6, 3) does not form any new triangles as 3 has higher degree than 6.
- (6, 8) does not form any new triangles as 8 has higher degree than 6.
- (6, 9) does not form any triangles as per the method.
- (8, 4) does not form any new triangles as 8 has higher degree than 4.
- (8, 6) does not form any new triangles as 8 has higher degree than 6.
- (9, 1) does not form any triangles as per the method.
- (9, 6) does not form any triangles as per the method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>.
