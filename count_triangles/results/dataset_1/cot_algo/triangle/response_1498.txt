Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Nodes in increasing order of connections: 6, 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4

Relabeled vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we analyze each edge while considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 0): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 8): Triangle formed: <2, 8, 4>.
8. Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 8): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (7, 3): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (8, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 8, 4>.
16. Edge (8, 4): Triangle formed: <2, 8, 4>.
17. Edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 8, 4>
