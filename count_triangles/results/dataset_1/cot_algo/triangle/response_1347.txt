Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly:

Node 6    : Degree 1
Node 4    : Degree 1
Node 8    : Degree 1
Node 9    : Degree 1
Node 1    : Degree 2
Node 5    : Degree 3
Node 6    : Degree 3
Node 7    : Degree 4
Node 3    : Degree 5
Node 0    : Degree 6

Using the sorted labels, we will now check each edge to count the number of triangles:

(0, 1): No triangles
(0, 2): No triangles
(0, 3): No triangles
(0, 7): No triangles
(1, 6): No triangles
(2, 5): Triangle <0, 2, 5>
(2, 9): No triangles
(3, 4): No triangles
(3, 5): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
(3, 7): Triangle <0, 3, 7>
(5, 7): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
