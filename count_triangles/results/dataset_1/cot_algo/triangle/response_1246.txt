Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 0 (2 connections) → Vertex 0 (label=0)
Vertex 1 (2 connections) → Vertex 1 (label=1)
Vertex 2 (2 connections) → Vertex 2 (label=2)
Vertex 3 (2 connections) → Vertex 3 (label=3)
Vertex 4 (2 connections) → Vertex 4 (label=4)
Vertex 5 (3 connections) → Vertex 5 (label=5)
Vertex 6 (1 connection) → Vertex 6 (label=6)
Vertex 7 (5 connections) → Vertex 7 (label=7)
Vertex 8 (4 connections) → Vertex 8 (label=8)
Vertex 9 (3 connections) → Vertex 9 (label=9)

Now, we will check for triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

There are 4 triangles in the graph: [5, 7, 8], [7, 8, 9], [0, 7, 9], [1, 7, 9]

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4]. Unique triangles found are: <5, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
