Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is: 

Node 8 (0 connections)  
Node 3 (1 connection)  
Node 5 (2 connections)  
Node 6 (2 connections)  
Node 9 (2 connections)  
Node 2 (3 connections)  
Node 4 (4 connections)  
Node 1 (5 connections)  
Node 7 (5 connections)  
Node 0 (5 connections)  

Next, we will count the triangles by examining each edge based on the vertices' labels. 

Triangles found:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
