Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:
- Checking edge (0, 2): Both nodes have the same degree, so we proceed.
- Checking edge (0, 3): Both nodes have the same degree, so we proceed.
- Checking edge (0, 5): Node 0 has more connections than node 5, so we proceed.
  - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 2, 3, and 9, forming the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- Checking edge (0, 9): Node 0 has more connections than node 9, so we proceed.
  - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 2, 3, and 5, forming the triangle <0, 2, 5>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
