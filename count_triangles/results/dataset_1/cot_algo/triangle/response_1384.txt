Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels are: 

- Node 0 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 3)
- Node 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 8 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 6 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 4)
- Node 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 5)

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <0, 3, 9>
2. Edge (0, 9) does not lead to a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 2, 7>
4. Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 4, 3>
5. Edge (1, 5) does not lead to a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 7) does not lead to a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 8) does not lead to a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 0) does not lead to a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <3, 4, 1>
11. Edge (3, 9) does not lead to a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 3) does not lead to a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 1) does not lead to a triangle.
15. Edge (5, 7) does not lead to a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 7) does not lead to a triangle.
17. Edge (6, 8) does not lead to a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 2) does not lead to a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 5) does not lead to a triangle.
20. Edge (7, 6) does not lead to a triangle.
21. Edge (7, 9) does not lead to a triangle.
22. Edge (8, 2) does not lead to a triangle.
23. Edge (8, 6) does not lead to a triangle.
24. Edge (9, 0) does not lead to a triangle.
25. Edge (9, 3) does not lead to a triangle.
26. Edge (9, 7) does not lead to a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, and <1, 4, 3>.
