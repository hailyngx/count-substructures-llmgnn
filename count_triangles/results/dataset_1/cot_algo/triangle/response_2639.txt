Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph after relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Vertices: 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 2, 9, 0

The edges to consider, with the first vertex having a lower label, are:
(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 3), (2, 9), (2, 5), (2, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7), (1, 8), (1, 6)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections, we find the following triangles: 
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
