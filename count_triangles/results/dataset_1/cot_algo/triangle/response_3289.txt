Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 7
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 3 (Degree 1) --> Node 0
Node 4 (Degree 2) --> Node 1
Node 5 (Degree 2) --> Node 2
Node 0 (Degree 3) --> Node 3
Node 2 (Degree 3) --> Node 4
Node 6 (Degree 3) --> Node 5
Node 9 (Degree 3) --> Node 6
Node 1 (Degree 4) --> Node 7
Node 8 (Degree 4) --> Node 8
Node 7 (Degree 7) --> Node 9

Now, let's go through the edges in the graph based on the relabeled nodes:

1. Edge between Node 0 and Node 1 (1, 7): Check for shared connections...
2. Edge between Node 0 and Node 7 (1, 9): Check for shared connections...
