Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 2
- Vertex 6 has degree 0
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 10 has degree 0

The sorted vertices are: 6, 0, 4, 7, 8, 1, 9, 2, 3, 5.

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 5):
  - Shared connections with 0: {1}
  - Shared connections with 5: {1, 2}
  - Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

- For edge (1, 2):
  - Shared connections with 1: {4, 5}
  - Shared connections with 2: {5, 9}
  - Triangle: <1, 2, 5>

- For edge (1, 4):
  - Shared connections with 1: {5}
  - Shared connections with 4: {3}
  - Triangle: <1, 3, 4>

- For edge (1, 5):

  - Shared connections with 7: {5, 8}
  - Triangle: <3, 5, 7> 

- For edge (3, 9):
  - Shared connections with 3: {5}
  - Shared connections with 9: {2, 5}
  - Triangle: <3, 5, 9> 

- For edge (4, 1):
