Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Relabeling the vertices:
Vertex 8 (degree 1) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 0 (degree 2) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 1 (degree 3) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will count the triangles by considering each edge:

- Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 have a shared connection, Vertex 2, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 1): Vertex 4, Vertex 1, and Vertex 3 form a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (4, 9): Vertex 4, Vertex 9, and Vertex 5 form a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <1, 3, 4>.
