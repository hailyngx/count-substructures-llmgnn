Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will first apply the Degree-Based Ordering method as described. 

The vertices with their corresponding connections are:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 8 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degrees:
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection 
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 8 connections

Next, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 0, 5, and 2. Triangle: <0, 5, 2>
- Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 1, 5, and 2. Triangle: <1, 5, 2>
- Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 2, 5, and 6. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
- Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 2, 6, and 3. Triangle: <2, 6, 3>
- Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 4, 5, and 2. Triangle: <4, 5, 2>
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 0): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (5, 1): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (5, 2): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with vertex 5, 6, and 2. Triangle: <5, 6, 2>
- Edge (6, 2): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 5): Triangle already counted.
- Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 2>, <1, 5, 2>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 3>, <4, 5, 2>, <5, 6, 2>.
