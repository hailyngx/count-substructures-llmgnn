Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Degree-based ordering:
Node 4: degree 1
Node 6: degree 0
Node 0: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 1: degree 5

Sorted nodes based on degree (ascending): 6, 4, 2, 9, 8, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1

Triangles:
[6] - no triangles
[4] - no triangles
[2] - no triangles
[9] - no triangles
[8] - no triangles
[3] - no triangles
[5] - no triangles
[7] - no triangles
[0] - <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 7>
[1] - <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
