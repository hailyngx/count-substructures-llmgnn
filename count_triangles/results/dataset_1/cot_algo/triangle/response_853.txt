Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 6)
Node 7 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 7. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Nodes 1 and 5. Triangle: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 5. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>
- Edge (4, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Nodes 0 and 6. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
- Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 7. Triangle: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 7. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Nodes 3 and 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 7. Triangle: <5, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 5. Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
- Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 7>.
