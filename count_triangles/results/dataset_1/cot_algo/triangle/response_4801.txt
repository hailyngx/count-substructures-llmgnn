Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
(1) - 1 connection
(9) - 1 connection
(5) - 2 connections
(8) - 2 connections
(6) - 3 connections
(3) - 4 connections
(1) - 4 connections
(2) - 5 connections
(0) - 6 connections
(4) - 7 connections
