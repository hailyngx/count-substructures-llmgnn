Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Nodes 3 and 5 have degree 0
- Nodes 6 and 8 have degree 2
- Nodes 0 and 4 have degree 4
- Nodes 2 and 9 have degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (1, 3) forms a triangle with 0 as <1, 3, 4>
- (1, 4) forms a triangle with 0 as <1, 4, 2>
- (2, 4) forms a triangle with 0 as <2, 4, 7>
- (7, 9) forms a triangle with 0 as <7, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
