Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertices: 
0 - degree 1
1 - degree 4
6 - degree 2
3 - degree 1
4 - degree 2
5 - degree 3
7 - degree 3
8 - degree 4
2 - degree 4
9 - degree 3

Now, we'll relabel the vertices according to their degree in ascending order:
0 - degree 1
3 - degree 1
6 - degree 2
4 - degree 2
5 - degree 3
7 - degree 3
9 - degree 3
1 - degree 4
8 - degree 4
2 - degree 4

Next, we'll proceed with counting the triangles. Since the lower labeled vertex in each edge pair must have fewer connections, we will focus on the following edges:

(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Counting the triangles:
1. <0, 1, 6>
2. <0, 1, 2>
3. <0, 1, 6>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 2, 9>
6. <3, 6, 1>
7. <4, 5, 8>
8. <4, 5, 9>
9. <5, 7, 8>
10. <5, 7, 8>
11. <7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles is [11].
