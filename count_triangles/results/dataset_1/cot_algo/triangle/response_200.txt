Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:  
Vertices: 5, 1, 0, 7, 6, 8, 3, 4, 9, 2  

Edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering:  
(5, 8)  
(1, 0)  
(0, 3)  
(7, 3)  
(6, 2)  
(8, 2)  
(3, 0)  
(4, 0)  
(9, 2)  

Calculating the number of triangles:
- (5, 8): No triangles formed
- (1, 0): No triangles formed
- (0, 3): No triangles formed
- (7, 3): No triangles formed
- (6, 2): No triangles formed
- (8, 2): No triangles formed
- (3, 0): Triangle formed with vertex 4: <0, 3, 4>
- (4, 0): No triangles formed
- (9, 2): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [1]  
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>
