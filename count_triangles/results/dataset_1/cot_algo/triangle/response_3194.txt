Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 1, 8, 9, 0, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 3.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1) - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 5, and 6. Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0 and 4. Shared connection with vertex 0: 1. Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 4> is found.

2. Edge (0, 5) - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 5, and 6. Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 0, 3, 7, and 8. Shared connection with vertex 0: 5. Therefore, triangle <0, 5, 3> is found.

3. Edge (0, 6) - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 5, and 6. Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 0, 2, 4, and 8. Shared connection with vertex 0: 6. Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 2> is found.

4. Edge (1, 4) - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0 and 4. Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Shared connection with vertex 1: 4. Therefore, triangle <1, 4, 2> is found.

5. Edge (2, 4) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 6, and 7. Shared connection with vertex 2: 4. Therefore, triangle <2, 4, 6> is found.

6. Edge (2, 6) - Already found in step 3.

7. Edge (2, 7) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5. Shared connection with vertex 2: 7. Therefore, triangle <2, 7, 4> is found.

8. Edge (2, 9) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 2 and 3. Shared connection with vertex 2: 9. Therefore, triangle <2, 9, 3> is found.

Total number of triangles: [5]
