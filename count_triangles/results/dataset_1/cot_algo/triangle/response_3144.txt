Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding connections:

0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
9: 1 connection
8: 4 connections
3: 4 connections

Now, let's go through each edge and check for triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Both 0 and 1 have 3 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

2. Edge (0, 4): 0 has 3 connections and 4 has 2 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

3. Edge (0, 5): 0 has 3 connections and 5 has 1 connection, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

4. Edge (1, 0): This edge has already been processed.

5. Edge (1, 3): 1 has 4 connections and 3 has 4 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

6. Edge (1, 6): 1 has 4 connections and 6 has 3 connections, so proceed.
   - Triangle formed: <1, 6, 2>.

7. Edge (2, 3): 2 has 2 connections and 3 has 4 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

8. Edge (2, 6): 2 has 2 connections and 6 has 3 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

9. Edge (3, 1): This edge has already been processed.

10. Edge (3, 2): This edge has already been processed.

11. Edge (3, 8): 3 has 4 connections and 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

12. Edge (3, 9): 3 has 4 connections and 9 has 1 connection, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

13. Edge (4, 0): This edge has already been processed.

14. Edge (4, 8): 4 has 2 connections and 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

15. Edge (5, 0): This edge has already been processed.

16. Edge (6, 1): This edge has already been processed.

17. Edge (6, 2): This edge has already been processed.

18. Edge (6, 8): 6 has 3 connections and 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
   - No triangles formed.

19. Edge (8, 3): This edge has already been processed.

20. Edge (8, 4): This edge has already been processed.

21. Edge (8, 6): This edge has already been processed.

22. Edge (9, 3): This edge has already been processed.

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 6, 2>.
