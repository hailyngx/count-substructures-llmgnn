Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 5 connections.
Vertex 4 has 5 connections.
Vertex 2 has 6 connections.
Vertex 5 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
