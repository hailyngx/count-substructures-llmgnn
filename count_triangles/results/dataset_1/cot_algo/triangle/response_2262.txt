Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 4)
Node 6 (degree 4)
Node 8 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 4)
Node 3 (degree 5)
Node 4 (degree 5)
Node 2 (degree 6)
Node 7 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we inspect each edge considering the lower labeled node first.
There are 10 triangles in total: [10]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 8>
