Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their degree: 
Vertices: 4, 3, 2, 8, 5, 7, 6, 0, 1, 9

Considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (0, 1): forms triangle with 6: <0, 1, 6>
2. (0, 6): forms triangle with 4: <0, 6, 4>
3. (0, 7): forms triangle with 2, 3, and 9: <0, 7, 2>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 9>
4. (1, 0): already counted in 1
5. (1, 5): forms triangle with 2: <1, 5, 2>
6. (1, 8): forms triangle with 9: <1, 8, 9>
7. (1, 9): forms triangle with 5: <1, 9, 5>
8. (2, 5): already counted in 5
9. (2, 7): forms triangle with 3 and 9: <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 9>
10. (3, 7): already counted in 9
11. (3, 9): already counted in 2 and 9
12. (4, 6): already counted in 2
13. (5, 1): already counted in 5
14. (5, 2): already counted in 5
15. (5, 8): forms triangle with 1 and 9: <5, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 9>
16. (6, 0): already counted in 1
17. (6, 4): already counted in 2
18. (6, 9): already counted in 1
19. (7, 0): already counted in 3
20. (7, 2): already counted in 9
21. (7, 3): already counted in 9
22. (7, 9): already counted in 3 and 9
23. (8, 1): already counted in 6
24. (8, 5): already counted in 15
25. (8, 9): already counted in 6 and 15
26. (9, 1): already counted in 6
27. (9, 3): already counted in 2 and 9
28. (9, 6): already counted in 1
29. (9, 7): already counted in 3 and 9
30. (9, 8): already counted in 24

Total number of triangles: [7]
