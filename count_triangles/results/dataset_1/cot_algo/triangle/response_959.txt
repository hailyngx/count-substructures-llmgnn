Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 0 - degree 2
Vertex 1 - degree 2
Vertex 2 - degree 1
Vertex 3 - degree 4
Vertex 4 - degree 3
Vertex 5 - degree 6
Vertex 6 - degree 3
Vertex 7 - degree 4
Vertex 8 - degree 4
Vertex 9 - degree 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
- Start with the edge (0, 4): Vertices 0 and 4 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (0, 5): Vertices 0 and 5 share 1 common connection (vertex 4). Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
- Move to the edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (1, 5): Vertices 1 and 5 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (2, 7): Vertices 2 and 7 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (3, 1): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 (degree 4) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6). Vertices 3 and 5 share 2 common connections (vertices 1 and 6). Triangles <1, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>.
- Move to the edge (3, 6): Vertices 3 and 6 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (3, 7): Vertices 3 and 7 share 1 common connection (vertex 6). Triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- Move to the edge (4, 0): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6). Vertices 4 and 5 share 2 common connections (vertices 0 and 8). Triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Move to the edge (4, 8): Vertices 4 and 8 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (5, 0): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (5, 1): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (5, 3): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (5, 4): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 (degree 6) has more connections than vertex 6 (degree 3), so no triangle.
- Move to the edge (5, 8): Vertices 5 and 8 share 1 common connection (vertex 4). Triangle <4, 5, 8>.
- Move to the edge (6, 3): Vertices 6 and 3 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (6, 5): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (6, 7): Vertices 6 and 7 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (7, 2): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (7, 3): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (7, 6): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (7, 8): Vertices 7 and 8 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (7, 9): Vertices 7 and 9 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (8, 4): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (8, 5): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (8, 7): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (8, 9): Vertices 8 and 9 do not share any common connections.
- Move to the edge (9, 7): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
- Move to the edge (9, 8): Proceed with caution due to the degree-based ordering.
