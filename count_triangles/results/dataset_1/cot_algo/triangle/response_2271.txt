Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in non-decreasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertex 1 (Degree = 0): 5   
Vertex 2 (Degree = 2): 4  
Vertex 3 (Degree = 1): 8  
Vertex 4 (Degree = 3): 6  
Vertex 5 (Degree = 0): 9  
Vertex 6 (Degree = 6): 1  
Vertex 7 (Degree = 4): 3  
Vertex 8 (Degree = 4): 2  
Vertex 9 (Degree = 3): 7  
Vertex 10 (Degree = 5): 10  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are as follows:

<0, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
