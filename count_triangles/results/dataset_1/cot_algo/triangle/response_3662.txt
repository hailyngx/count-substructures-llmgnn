Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 3
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles and find the total number of triangles to be 6, which are formed by the following unique triangles:
<4, 0, 2>
<5, 1, 7>
<5, 4, 6>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 7, 4>
<8, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
