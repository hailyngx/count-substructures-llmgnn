Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.  

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 6: 7 connections

Following the method, we analyze each edge. For some of them, both ends are evaluated, while for others, only one side is evaluated:

- Edge (0, 6): Both ends have different numbers of connections (2 and 7), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 0 and 6: 1, 2, 3
    - Triangle <0, 2, 6> found.

- Edge (0, 7): Both ends have different numbers of connections (2 and 2), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 0 and 7: None

- Edge (1, 2): Both ends have different numbers of connections (4 and 4), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 1 and 2: None

- Edge (1, 4): Both ends have different numbers of connections (2 and 4), so we proceed.
    - Shared connections between 1 and 4: None

- Edge (2, 1): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (2, 3):
    - Shared connections between 2 and 3: None

- Edge (2, 4): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (2, 6): 
    - Shared connections between 2 and 6: 0, 3
    - Triangle <0, 2, 6> found again.

- Edge (2, 8): 
    - Shared connections between 2 and 8: None

- Edge (3, 2): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (3, 6): 
    - Shared connections between 3 and 6: 0
    - Triangle <0, 3, 6> found.

- Edge (3, 9):
    - Shared connections between 3 and 9: None

- Edge (4, 1): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (4, 2): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (5, 6):
    - Shared connections between 5 and 6: None

- Edge (6, 0): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (6, 2): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (6, 3): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (6, 5): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (6, 7):
    - Shared connections between 6 and 7: 0
    - Triangle <0, 6, 7> found.

- Edge (6, 8): 
    - Shared connections between 6 and 8: None

- Edge (6, 9): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (7, 0): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (7, 6): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (8, 2): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (8, 6): 
    - Shared connections between 8 and 6: None

- Edge (9, 3): Proceed to the next edge.

- Edge (9, 6):
    - Shared connections between 9 and 6: None

The total number of triangles is [3].
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 6, 7>.
