Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following list: 

Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we analyze the edges to count the number of triangles. 

From the given edges, we find the following triangles:

<0, 8, 4>
<0, 7, 6>
<1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
