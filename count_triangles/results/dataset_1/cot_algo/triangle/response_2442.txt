Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1 (0): 3 connections
Node 2 (2): 3 connections
Node 3 (3): 2 connections
Node 4 (5): 2 connections
Node 5 (6): 3 connections
Node 6 (7): 2 connections
Node 7 (8): 1 connection
Node 8 (9): 3 connections

Now we'll relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

Node 1 (8): 1 connection
Node 2 (3): 2 connections
Node 3 (4): 2 connections
Node 4 (6): 2 connections
Node 5 (2): 3 connections
Node 6 (5): 3 connections
Node 7 (1): 3 connections
Node 8 (7): 3 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
