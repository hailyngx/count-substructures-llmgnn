Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0 (1 connection)
7 (1 connection)
2 (2 connections)
5 (2 connections)
6 (2 connections)
4 (3 connections)
1 (4 connections)
8 (4 connections)
3 (5 connections)
9 (7 connections)

Now, we will check for triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<8, 5, 3>
<8, 9, 6>
[9 triangles]
