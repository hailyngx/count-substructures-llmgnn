Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 4 connections  
Vertex 4: 4 connections  
Vertex 5: 0 connections  
Vertex 6: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 9: 3 connections  
Vertex 10: 2 connections  

Now, let's identify the triangles by examining the edges:

For edge (0, 2):
- Vertex 0 and Vertex 2 share connections with Vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 2, 7>.

For edge (0, 4):
- Vertex 0 and Vertex 4 share connections with Vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 4, 7>.

For edge (0, 7):
- Vertex 0 and Vertex 7 share connections with Vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 7, 4>.

For edge (0, 8):
- No triangles formed.

For edge (1, 4):
- No triangles formed.

For edge (1, 6):
- No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 0):
- No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 3):
- No triangles formed.

For edge (2, 7):
- Vertex 2 and Vertex 7 share connections with Vertex 0, forming a triangle <2, 7, 0>.

Continuing this process for the remaining edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 0>.
