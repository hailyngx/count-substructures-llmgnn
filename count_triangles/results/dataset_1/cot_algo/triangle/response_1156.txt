Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 5 and 8 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 1, 6, and 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 0, 2, and 7 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 3 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

There are 19 triangles in total.
