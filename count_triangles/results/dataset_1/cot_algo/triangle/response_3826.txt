Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows: 

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Using these new labels, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): Node 0 has a connection with Node 2, and they share Node 5 forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- For edge (1, 5): Node 1 has a connection with Node 5, but they do not form a triangle with any common node.
- For edge (2, 5): Node 2 has a connection with Node 5, but they do not form a triangle with any common node.
- For edge (3, 8): Node 3 has a connection with Node 8, but they do not form a triangle with any common node.
- For edge (3, 9): Node 3 has a connection with Node 9, but they do not form a triangle with any common node.
- For edge (5, 7): Node 5 has a connection with Node 7, and they share Node 9 forming a triangle <5, 7, 9>.
- For edge (7, 9): Node 7 has a connection with Node 9, but they do not form a triangle with any common node.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <5, 7, 9>
