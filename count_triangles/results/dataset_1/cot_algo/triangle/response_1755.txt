Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Triangles found using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
[<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>] 

Total number of triangles: [3]
