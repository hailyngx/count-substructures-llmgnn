Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
    Node 1: 3 edges
    Node 2: 4 edges
    Node 3: 3 edges
    Node 4: 3 edges
    Node 5: 2 edges
    Node 6: 2 edges
    Node 7: 3 edges
    Node 8: 4 edges
    Node 9: 1 edge

Next, we relabel the nodes from smallest degree to largest degree:
    Node 9 (1 edge) -> Node 5 (2 edges) -> Node 6 (2 edges) -> Node 1 (3 edges) -> Node 3 (3 edges) -> Node 4 (3 edges) -> Node 7 (3 edges) -> Node 2 (4 edges) -> Node 8 (4 edges)

Now, let's count the triangles by examining each edge:

- Edge (1, 3) connects Node 5 and Node 7, forming a triangle with Node 1: <1, 5, 7>
- Edge (1, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) connects Node 9 and Node 6, forming a triangle with Node 2: <2, 6, 9>
- Edge (2, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) connects Node 3 and Node 1, forming a triangle with Node 2: <2, 3, 1>
- Edge (3, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) connects Node 5 and Node 7, forming a triangle with Node 3: <3, 5, 7>
- Edge (4, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) connects Node 5 and Node 3, forming a triangle with Node 7: <7, 3, 5>
- Edge (8, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) doesn't form a triangle.

The total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <1, 5, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 1>
