Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 3 with 0 connections
- Node 4 with 1 connection
- Node 7 with 1 connection
- Node 5 with 2 connections
- Node 1 with 3 connections
- Node 9 with 3 connections
- Node 6 with 4 connections
- Node 2 with 5 connections
- Node 8 with 5 connections
- Node 0 with 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges in the following order:
1. (3, 4): No triangles
2. (4, 7): No triangles
3. (5, 9): No triangles
4. (6, 9): No triangles
5. (6, 1): No triangles
6. (1, 2): No triangles
7. (9, 5): No triangles
8. (7, 0): No triangles
9. (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 8>
10. (0, 5): No triangles
11. (0, 7): No triangles
12. (0, 8): No triangles
13. (1, 6): No triangles
14. (2, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 8>
15. (2, 1): No triangles
16. (2, 8): No triangles
17. (3, 4): No triangles
18. (4, 3): No triangles
19. (5, 0): No triangles
20. (6, 8): Triangle <0, 6, 8>
21. (6, 1): No triangles
22. (8, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 8>
23. (8, 2): No triangles
24. (8, 6): Triangle <0, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 8>.
