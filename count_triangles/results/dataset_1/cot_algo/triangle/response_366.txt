Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 9), (4, 3), (7, 3), (5, 0), (6, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 8)

Calculating the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 5, 6> formed by nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Triangle <3, 4, 7> formed by nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Triangle <0, 8, 3> formed by nodes 0, 8, and 3.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
