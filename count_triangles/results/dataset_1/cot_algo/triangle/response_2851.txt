Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is:
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

(1, 4) - Forms triangles with 3 and 6
(2, 5) - Forms a triangle with 0
(7, 2) - No triangles formed
(4, 1) - Forms triangles with 3 and 6
(5, 2) - No triangles formed
(7, 4) - Forms a triangle with 6
(6, 1) - No triangles formed
(6, 7) - Forms a triangle with 4
(9, 3) - No triangles formed
(0, 3) - No triangles formed
(0, 5) - No triangles formed
(0, 6) - No triangles formed
(3, 0) - No triangles formed
(3, 4) - Forms a triangle with 1
(3, 9) - No triangles formed
(4, 3) - Forms a triangle with 1
(4, 5) - Forms a triangle with 0
(4, 6) - Forms a triangle with 1
(4, 7) - Forms a triangle with 6
(5, 0) - No triangles formed
(5, 4) - Forms a triangle with 0
(5, 7) - Forms a triangle with 2
(6, 0) - No triangles formed
(6, 4) - Forms a triangle with 1
(6, 7) - Forms a triangle with 4
(7, 5) - Forms a triangle with 2

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 1>, <4, 5, 0>, <6, 7, 4>.
