Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph: 

There are 6 triangles in total:
[6]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
