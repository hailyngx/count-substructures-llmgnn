Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with vertices sorted by their degree:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 4>
2. <0, 1, 7>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <0, 7, 2>
5. <0, 7, 4>
6. <0, 7, 8>
7. <1, 2, 7>
8. <1, 4, 7>
9. <1, 6, 5>
10. <3, 5, 2>
11. <3, 7, 8>
12. <5, 6, 1>
13. <5, 6, 9>
14. <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [14]
