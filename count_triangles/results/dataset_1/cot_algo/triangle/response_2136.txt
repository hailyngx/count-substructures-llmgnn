Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 7 has 1 connection
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have 3 connections
- Nodes 1 and 6 have 4 connections
- Node 8 has 5 connections

Calculating the number of triangles:

- For the edge (2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 share 2 connections (1, 8), forming the triangle <1, 6, 2>.
- For the edge (3, 0): Node 0 and Node 3 share 3 connections (4, 5, 6), forming the triangle <0, 3, 6>.
- For the edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 share 1 connection (0), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share 1 connection (0), no triangle is formed.
- For the edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 share 4 connections (0, 2, 5, 8), forming the triangles <0, 3, 6> and <1, 6, 2>.
