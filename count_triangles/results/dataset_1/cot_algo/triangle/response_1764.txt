Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Next, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

1. Vertex 1
2. Vertex 2
3. Vertex 0
4. Vertex 8
5. Vertex 4
6. Vertex 9
7. Vertex 3 (missing vertex inserted for labeling convenience)
8. Vertex 7
9. Vertex 6
10. Vertex 5

Now, we consider each edge and count the triangles while following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Counting triangles:
1. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections between 0 and 5 are 7. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
2. Edge (0, 9): Shared connections between 0 and 9 are 6. Triangle formed: <0, 9, 6>
3. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7.
4. Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
5. Edge (4, 6): Shared connections between 4 and 6 are 7. Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>
6. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections between 4 and 7 are 5. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 5>
7. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections between 5 and 7 are 4. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 6>
8. Edge (5, 8): Shared connections between 5 and 8 are 6. Triangle formed: <5, 8, 6>
9. Edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2.
10. Edge (6, 4): Shared connections between 6 and 4 are 7. Triangle formed: <6, 4, 7>
11. Edge (6, 8): Shared connections between 6 and 8 are 5. Triangle formed: <6, 8, 5>
12. Edge (6, 9): Shared connections between 6 and 9 are 7. Triangle formed: <6, 9, 0>
13. Edge (7, 1): No triangles can be formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
14. Edge (7, 4): Shared connections between 7 and 4 are 5. Triangle formed: <7, 4, 5>
15. Edge (7, 5): Shared connections between 7 and 5 are 4. Triangle formed: <7, 5, 6>
16. Edge (7, 9): Shared connections between 7 and 9 are 6. Triangle formed: <7, 9, 0>
17. Edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed as vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
18. Edge (8, 6): Shared connections between 8 and 6 are 5. Triangle formed: <8, 6, 5>
19. Edge (9, 0): Shared connections between 9 and 0 are 5. Triangle formed: <9, 0, 5>
20. Edge (9, 6): Shared connections between 9 and 6 are 7. Triangle formed: <9, 6, 4>
21. Edge (9, 7): Shared connections between 9 and 7 are 6. Triangle formed: <9, 7, 0>

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 5, 7>, <0, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 6>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 9, 0>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 5, 6>, <7, 9, 0>, <8, 6, 5>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 7, 0>
