Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph:

- Sort the vertices based on the number of connections:
  - Node 0: 1 connection
  - Node 1: 2 connections
  - Node 3: 2 connections
  - Node 7: 2 connections
  - Node 9: 2 connections
  - Node 8: 2 connections
  - Node 6: 4 connections
  - Node 2: 4 connections
  - Node 4: 5 connections
  - Node 5: 6 connections

Next, we start checking edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 1 connection and Node 5 has 6 connections, forming 1 triangle: <0, 5, 3>
2. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 3 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, forming 1 triangle: <1, 6, 2>
4. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 5 connections, no triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, no triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 8 has 2 connections, forming 1 triangle: <2, 8, 4>
7. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, no triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 5 connections, no triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 has 5 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, forming 1 triangle: <4, 5, 0>
10. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 5 connections and Node 8 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 has 5 connections and Node 9 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 0): Node 0 has 1 connection and Node 5 has 6 connections, no triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 3): Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, no triangle formed.
14. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, forming 1 triangle: <5, 6, 1>
15. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, no triangle formed.
16. Edge (6, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, no triangle formed.
17. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 has 4 connections and Node 7 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 6): Node 7 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, no triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
20. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 8 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
21. Edge (8, 4): Node 4 has 5 connections and Node 8 has 2 connections, no triangle formed.
22. Edge (9, 4): Node 9 has 2 connections and Node 4 has 5 connections, no triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 3>, <1, 6, 2>, and <2, 8, 4>.
