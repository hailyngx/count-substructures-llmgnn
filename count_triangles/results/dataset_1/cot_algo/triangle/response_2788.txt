Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labeling is:  

Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 2 (Degree 1)
Vertex 5 (Degree 1)
Vertex 6 (Degree 1)
Vertex 7 (Degree 1)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
Vertex 0 (Degree 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree 5)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles present in the graph:  
The total number of triangles is [10].  

The unique triangles found in the graph are:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<1, 6, 7>
