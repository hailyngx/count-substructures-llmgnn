Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of vertices sorted by their degree:

Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertices 6 and 9: 1 connection
Vertices 2, 7, and 8: 2 connections
Vertices 0, 1, and 5: 4 connections
Vertices 3 and 4: 5 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 5 (0 connections) -> Vertex A
Vertices 6 and 9 (1 connection each) -> Vertices B and C
Vertices 2, 7, and 8 (2 connections each) -> Vertices D, E, and F
Vertices 0, 1, and 5 (4 connections each) -> Vertices G, H, and I
Vertices 3 and 4 (5 connections each) -> Vertices J and K

Now, we will go through each edge to count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 1): Both vertices 0 and 1 have 4 connections, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
2. (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, which is fewer than vertex 3's 5 connections. We proceed and find a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
3. (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, which is fewer than vertex 4's 5 connections. We proceed and find a triangle <0, 4, 3>.
4. (0, 8): Both vertices 0 and 8 have 4 connections, so we proceed. They share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle <0, 8, 3>.
5. (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, which is fewer than vertex 3's 5 connections. We proceed and find a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
6. (3, 4): Both vertices 3 and 4 have 5 connections, so we proceed. They share connections with vertices 0 and 9 forming two triangles <3, 4, 0> and <3, 4, 9>.
7. (3, 7): Vertex 3 has 5 connections, which is fewer than vertex 7's 2 connections. We proceed and find a triangle <3, 7, 6>.
8. (3, 9): Vertex 3 has 5 connections, which is fewer than vertex 9's 1 connection. We proceed and find a triangle <3, 9, 4>.
9. (4, 9): Vertex 4 has 5 connections, which is fewer than vertex 9's 1 connection. We proceed and find a triangle <4, 9, 3>.

Thus, there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph: [<0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 6>].
