Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 9 has 1 connection
- Nodes 3 and 8 have 2 connections each
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 3 connections each
- Nodes 1 and 4 have 4 connections each
- Nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 5 connections each

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 1): 
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 9
   - Nodes 0 and 1 share node 5, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 4):
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 8
   - Nodes 0 and 4 share node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 5):
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
   - Nodes 0 and 5 share nodes 1 and 7, forming triangles <0, 1, 5> and <0, 5, 7>.
4. Edge (0, 7):
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6
   - Nodes 0 and 7 share node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
   
Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph.
The output is: [4]
