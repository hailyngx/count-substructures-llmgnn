Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Based on the ordering above, we re-label the nodes:
Node 9 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 1 (Degree 2) -> Node 1
Node 5 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Node 3
Node 3 (Degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 5
Node 4 (Degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 8

Now, we check for triangles among the edges (in the re-labeled format):
(0, 2) - No triangle
(0, 7) - No triangle
(1, 4) - No triangle
(1, 5) - No triangle
(3, 2) - No triangle
(3, 4) - No triangle
(3, 7) - Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
(6, 1) - No triangle
(6, 4) - No triangle
(6, 7) - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>
(6, 5) - No triangle
(4, 2) - No triangle
(4, 7) - Triangle formed: <4, 6, 7>
(4, 0) - No triangle
(7, 2) - Triangle formed: <3, 6, 7>
(7, 5) - No triangle
(9, 4) - No triangle

Count of triangles in the graph: [3]
Unique triangles found: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>
