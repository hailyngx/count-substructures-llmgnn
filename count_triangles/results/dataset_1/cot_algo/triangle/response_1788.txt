Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections: 

0: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 1 connection
5: 4 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 4
1 -> 5
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 1
5 -> 4
6 -> 2
7 -> 2
8 -> 2
9 -> 1

Now, we will check for triangles based on the given edges, considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 8, 5>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 7>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 1, 5>
<8, 1, 7>
<8, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [16]
