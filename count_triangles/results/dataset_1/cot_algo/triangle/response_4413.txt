Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 5, 0, 8, 2

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will look at the edges in the following order:
(7, 8), (6, 4), (9, 8), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (0, 5), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 2)

After checking each edge, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>.
