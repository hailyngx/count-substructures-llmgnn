Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 1 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 3 connections
Node 5 has 4 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 8 has 4 connections
Node 3 has 5 connections
Node 2 has 5 connections

With the vertices relabeled, we have the following edges to consider:

(0, 3)
(1, 3)
(1, 8)
(2, 3)
(2, 4)
(2, 5)
(2, 8)
(3, 4)
(3, 7)
(4, 5)
(4, 8)
(5, 9)
(6, 7)
(7, 8)

Analyzing the shared connections between these edges, we find the following triangles:

<1, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
