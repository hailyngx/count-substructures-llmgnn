Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the order is: 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 0, 9, 1.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting triangles formed by shared connections, we find that there are 7 triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <9, 6, 2>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
