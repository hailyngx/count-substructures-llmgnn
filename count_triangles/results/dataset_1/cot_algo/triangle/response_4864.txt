Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertices 9 and 10: 1 connection
Vertices 3, 7, and 8: 2 connections
Vertices 1, 5, and 6: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles. 

After analyzing the graph, the total number of triangles is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
