Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Nodes: [7, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3, 5, 8, 6, 9]

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For edge (0, 1): 
   - 0 shares connections with 3 and 8
   - 1 shares connections with 7 and 8
   Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

2. For edge (0, 3): 
   - 0 shares connections with 1 and 8
   - 3 shares connections with 4 and 5
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

3. For edge (0, 8): 
   - 0 shares connections with 1 and 3
   - 8 shares connections with 1 and 2
   Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

4. For edge (1, 7): 
   - 1 shares connection with 0
   - 7 shares connection with 9
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

5. For edge (2, 5): 
   - 2 shares connection with 8 and 9
   - 5 shares connection with 3
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

6. For edge (2, 8): 
   - 2 shares connection with 5 and 9
   - 8 shares connection with 0 and 1
   Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

7. For edge (2, 9): 
   - 2 shares connection with 5 and 8
   - 9 shares connection with 3 and 7
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

8. For edge (3, 4): 
   - 3 shares connections with 0 and 5
   - 4 shares connection with 3
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

9. For edge (3, 5): 
   - 3 shares connections with 0 and 4
   - 5 shares connection with 2
   Therefore, no triangles are formed.

10. For edge (3, 9): 
    - 3 shares connections with 4 and 5
    - 9 shares connections with 2 and 7
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

11. For edge (4, 3): 
    - 4 shares connection with 3
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

12. For edge (5, 2): 
    - 5 shares connection with 3
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

13. For edge (7, 1): 
    - 7 shares connection with 9
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

14. For edge (7, 9): 
    - 7 shares connection with 1
    - 9 shares connection with 2
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

15. For edge (8, 0): 
    - 8 shares connections with 2 and 1
    Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

16. For edge (8, 1): 
    - 8 shares connections with 2 and 0
    Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

17. For edge (8, 2): 
    - 8 shares connections with 1 and 0
    - 2 shares connection with 5 and 9
    Therefore, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 8>.

18. For edge (9, 2): 
    - 9 shares connection with 7
    - 2 shares connection with 5 and 8
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

19. For edge (9, 3): 
    - 9 shares connections with 7 and 2
    - 3 shares connections with 0 and 4
    Therefore, no triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles are <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 8>.
