Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The list will be as follows: 
Nodes with 1 connection: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
Nodes with 2 connections: 4
Nodes with 3 connections: 3
Nodes with 4 connections: 1, 9
Nodes with 5 connections: 2

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0
5 -> 1
6 -> 2
7 -> 3
8 -> 4
4 -> 5
3 -> 6
1 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge and check for shared connections to count the triangles:
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 9>

Count of triangles: [4]
