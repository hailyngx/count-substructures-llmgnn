Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to first sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections).

The vertices with their degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
- Vertex 5: 0 connections
- Vertex 6: 0 connections
- Vertex 2: 0 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 5 connections
- Vertex 0: 6 connections

Next, we will check each edge, ensuring that the vertex with the lower label comes first:
- <0, 1>: 6 shared connections (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8)
- <0, 3>: 4 shared connections (0, 7, 8, 9)
- <0, 5>: 2 shared connections (0, 9)
- <0, 7>: 3 shared connections (0, 1, 8)
- <1, 7>: 3 shared connections (1, 8, 9)
- <1, 8>: 3 shared connections (1, 8, 9)
- <1, 9>: 3 shared connections (1, 8, 9)
- <3, 7>: 2 shared connections (7, 8)
- <3, 8>: 4 shared connections (8, 6, 9, 2)
- <3, 9>: 3 shared connections (9, 8, 1)

Counting the total number of triangles, we get:
[5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>
