Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0, 5.

After relabeling the vertices, the edges are as follows: (4, 5), (6, 5), (7, 2), (9, 5), (1, 0), (3, 2), (8, 0).

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Triangle <2, 5, 7> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <0, 1, 8> (shared connection: 0)
- Triangle <5, 4, 6> (shared connection: 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
