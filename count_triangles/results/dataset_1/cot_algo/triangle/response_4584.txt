Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 4: 1 connection
   - Vertex 5: 2 connections
   - Vertex 3: 2 connections
   - Vertex 6: 3 connections
   - Vertex 8: 3 connections
   - Vertex 9: 4 connections
   - Vertex 1: 3 connections
   - Vertex 0: 3 connections
   - Vertex 2: 2 connections
   - Vertex 7: 3 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 0 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 1
   - Vertex 2 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 2
   - Vertex 3 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 3
   - Vertex 4 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 4
   - Vertex 5 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 5
   - Vertex 6 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 6
   - Vertex 7 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 7
   - Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 8
   - Vertex 8 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 9
   - Vertex 9 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 10

3. Count the number of triangles:
   - Triangle 1: <0, 1, 2>
   - Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>
   - Triangle 3: <0, 1, 9>
   - Triangle 4: <1, 6, 8>
   - Triangle 5: <6, 8, 9>
   - Triangle 6: <0, 2, 3>
   - Triangle 7: <0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [7].
