Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling: 
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method (considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections), we can count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 3>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
3. Triangle <1, 3, 0>
4. Triangle <1, 8, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
6. Triangle <2, 8, 7>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, there are [7] triangles in total in the given graph.
