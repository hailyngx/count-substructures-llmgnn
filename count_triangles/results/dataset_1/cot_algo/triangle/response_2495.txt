Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Next, we'll relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node A
Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node B
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node C
Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node D
Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node E
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node F
Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node G
Node 4 (degree 4) -> Node H
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node I
Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node J

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges and the shared connections between the vertices:

1. <A, D, G>
2. <A, G, I>
3. <A, G, J>
4. <B, E, J>
5. <C, I, J>
6. <D, G, F>
7. <D, G, I>
8. <D, H, F>
9. <D, H, I>
10. <E, F, I>
11. <E, F, J>
12. <E, H, J>
13. <F, H, I>
14. <G, I, J>
15. <H, I, J>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
