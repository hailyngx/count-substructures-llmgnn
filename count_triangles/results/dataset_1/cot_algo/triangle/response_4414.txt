Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
By listing the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 8: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: 1
