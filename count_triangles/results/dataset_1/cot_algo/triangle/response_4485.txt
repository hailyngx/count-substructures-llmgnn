Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the new labels for the vertices: 
Vertices: 6, 8, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 0, 9, 7

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<4, 0, 7>
<7, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
