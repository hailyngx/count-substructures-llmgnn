Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method in the provided graph:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.

Based on the ordering, we relabel the nodes as:
Nodes with 2 connections: 0, 9
Nodes with 3 connections: 2, 5, 6, 8
Nodes with 4 connections: 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, we identify the triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 4, 9>
<7, 6, 4>
<8, 3, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
