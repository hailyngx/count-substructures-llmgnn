Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph with Degree-Based Ordering:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 0: Degree 4

Edges that satisfy the condition (lower label has fewer connections):
(0, 2) -> Shared connections: 8
(0, 4) -> Shared connections: 
(0, 8) -> Shared connections: 2
(1, 7) -> Shared connections: 8
(1, 8) -> Shared connections: 8
(3, 5) -> Shared connections: 
(3, 7) -> Shared connections: 1
(4, 0) -> Shared connections: 
(5, 9) -> Shared connections: 
(7, 3) -> Shared connections: 

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 5, 7>
