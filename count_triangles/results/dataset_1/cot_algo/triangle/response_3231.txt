Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each vertex by counting the number of connections it has. Then, we will sort the vertices according to their degrees, and assign labels accordingly. 

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, we will assign labels to the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 3, 4, 6, 9 → Label 1
- Node 1, 5, 8 → Label 2
- Node 7 → Label 3
- Node 0 → Label 4

Next, we will list the edges following the condition where we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label comes first:

(3, 0), (4, 5), (4, 5), (4, 8), (6, 0), (3, 0), (6, 0), (6, 7), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 9), (7, 9), (7, 9)

Now, we will look for shared connections to form triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle <1, 7, 9>

Finally, we output the total number of triangles in brackets:
