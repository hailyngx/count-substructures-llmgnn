Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Nodes: 0 (degree 3), 2 (degree 1), 8 (degree 3), 9 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 1 (degree 7), 6 (degree 5).

Using the degree-based ordering method, we look at each edge considering the node with the lower label first if it has fewer connections.

By examining the edges, the triangles found are: 
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
