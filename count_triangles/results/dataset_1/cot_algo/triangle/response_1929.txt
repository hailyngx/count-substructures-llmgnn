Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertices: 5, 7, 1, 6, 8, 3, 0, 2, 4, 9

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 (degree 5) has fewer connections than vertex 2 (degree 6).
Shared connections of vertices 0 and 2: 3, 4, 6, 9
Triangles with edge (0, 2): 
    <0, 2, 3>
    <0, 2, 4>
    <0, 2, 6>
    <0, 2, 9>

For other edges, the lower labeled vertex already has more connections, so no additional triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
