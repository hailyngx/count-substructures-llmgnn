Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted by their number of connections:

Vertices: 3, 6, 5, 8, 9, 1, 0, 4, 7, 2

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 2]
<2, 0, 4>
<4, 1, 7>
