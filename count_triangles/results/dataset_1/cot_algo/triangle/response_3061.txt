Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes based on the number of connections each node has:

Node 7: 0 connections
Node 9: 0 connections
Nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8: 1 connection each
Node 6: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 3: 4 connections each

Next, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 1): Node 1 has 4 connections, so we count the number of triangles formed through Node 1. No triangles are formed in this case.
- Edge (0, 2): Node 2 has 1 connection. Since Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection through Node 5, we have a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 share connections through Node 3, so we have a triangle <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (1, 0): Node 1 has 4 connections. No new triangles.
- Edge (1, 3): Node 3 has 4 connections. No new triangles.
- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 4 connections. No new triangles.
- Edge (2, 0): Node 2 has 1 connection. No new triangles.
- Edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 1 connection. No new triangles.
- Edge (3, 1): Node 1 already considered.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 4 has 1 connection. No new triangles.
- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 already considered.
- Edge (3, 8): Node 8 has 1 connection. No new triangles.
- Edge (4, 3): Node 3 already considered.
- Edge (4, 5): Node 5 has 1 connection. No new triangles.
- Edge (5, 2): Node 2 already considered.
- Edge (5, 4): Node 4 already considered.
- Edge (6, 0): Node 6 already considered.
- Edge (6, 3): Node 3 already considered.
- Edge (8, 3): Node 8 already considered.
- Edge (9, 1): Node 9 has 0 connections. No new triangles.

In total, we have counted 2 triangles: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 3, 6>.

The total number of triangles is [2].
