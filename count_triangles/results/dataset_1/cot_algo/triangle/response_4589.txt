Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: 1, 5, 8
1: 0, 5, 9
2: 3, 5, 8, 9
3: 2, 4
4: 3, 6, 8, 9
5: 0, 1, 2, 9
6: 4, 8, 9
8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
```

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degree:
```
0: 3
3: 2
1: 3
4: 4
2: 4
5: 4
6: 3
8: 5
9: 6
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will process the edges:
1. Check (0, 1) - Proceed
   Shared connections: 5
2. Check (0, 5) - Proceed
   Shared connections: 1
3. Check (0, 8) - Proceed
   Shared connections: None
4. Check (1, 5) - Proceed
   Shared connections: 0
5. Check (1, 9) - Proceed
   Shared connections: None
6. Check (3, 2) - Proceed
   Shared connections: None
7. Check (3, 4) - Proceed
   Shared connections: None
8. Check (4, 6) - Proceed
   Shared connections: 9
9. Check (4, 8) - Proceed
   Shared connections: 2
10. Check (6, 8) - Proceed
    Shared connections: 4
11. Check (8, 9) - Proceed
    Shared connections: 4, 5
12. Check (9, 5) - Proceed
    Shared connections: 1, 2
13. Check (9, 6) - Proceed
    Shared connections: 4
14. Check (9, 8) - Proceed
    Shared connections: 5

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>
