Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 - Label 0
Node 8 - Label 1
Node 7 - Label 2
Node 1 - Label 3
Node 5 - Label 4
Node 4 - Label 5
Node 6 - Label 6
Node 9 - Label 7
Node 3 - Label 8
Node 0 - Label 9

Based on the given edges and the new labels, we will now count the number of triangles.
There are [4] triangles in total.

Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
