Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 5 has degree 0.
- Vertices 1, 3, 5, and 10 have degree 1.
- Vertices 4 and 7 have degree 2.
- Vertices 2, 6, and 8 have degree 4.
- Vertex 9 has degree 3.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections:
Vertices: 5, 1, 10, 3, 7, 4, 9, 2, 6, 8

Next, we will count the triangles by going through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (1, 2): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
- For edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7. Vertex 1 -> 7 is a triangle, as they share vertex 1.
- For edge (2, 1): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (2, 3): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
- For edge (2, 6): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
- For edge (2, 8): Both vertices have the same degree, so we proceed.
- For edge (3, 2): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 6. Vertex 4 -> 6 is a triangle, as they share vertex 6.
- For edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 7. Vertex 4 -> 7 is a triangle, as they share vertex 4.
- For edge (6, 2): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 8. Vertex 6 -> 8 is a triangle, as they share vertex 6.
- For edge (7, 1): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (7, 4): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has fewer connections than vertex 9. Vertex 7 -> 9 is a triangle, as they share vertex 7.
- For edge (8, 2): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (8, 6): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9. Vertex 8 -> 9 is a triangle, as they share vertex 8.
- For edge (9, 7): This edge was already counted.
- For edge (9, 8): This edge was already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are:
<1, 7, 2>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 9>.
