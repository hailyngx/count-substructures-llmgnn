Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we have the following labels:

Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge:

1. Edge (0, 3) forms triangles with shared connections 9 and 6.
2. Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
3. Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
5. Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
6. Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 1.
8. Edge (3, 0) forms triangles with shared connections 9 and 6.
9. Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
11. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (6, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
13. Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
14. Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (6, 9) forms triangles with shared connections 0 and 3.
16. Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
17. Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 2.
19. Edge (9, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 6.
20. Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 0.
21. Edge (9, 6) forms triangles with shared connections 0 and 3.
22. Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 2>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 9, 2>, <2, 0, 6>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 6, 0>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 0, 9>, <3, 6, 0>, <6, 0, 2>.
