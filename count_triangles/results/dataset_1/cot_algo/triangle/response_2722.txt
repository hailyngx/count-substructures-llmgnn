Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have, the new order is as follows: 

Vertex 6 (0 connections)  
Vertex 4 (1 connection)  
Vertex 5 (1 connection)  
Vertex 2 (2 connections)  
Vertex 0 (2 connections)  
Vertex 9 (3 connections)  
Vertex 3 (4 connections)  
Vertex 8 (4 connections)  
Vertex 7 (5 connections)  
Vertex 1 (6 connections)  

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can now count the triangles in the graph. 

There are 8 triangles in total inside brackets []: [15]

The unique triangles found are as follows:

<3, 7, 8>  
<3, 7, 5>  
<3, 1, 7>  
<8, 7, 5>  
<8, 7, 1>  
<0, 1, 9>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<3, 1, 9>
