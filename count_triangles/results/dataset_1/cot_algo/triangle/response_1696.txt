Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 -> Degree 4
Node 1 -> Degree 2
Node 5 -> Degree 1
Node 4 -> Degree 1
Node 9 -> Degree 2
Node 6 -> Degree 3
Node 2 -> Degree 3
Node 8 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 5
Node 3 -> Degree 5

Following the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges with the node having the lower label having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangle with node 3 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 1 and 2 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 8 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (1, 3): Forms triangle with node 0 -> Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 3 -> Triangle <2, 7, 3>
- Edge (3, 4): Forms triangle with node 7 -> Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Edge (3, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 0, 1, 2 and 4 -> Triangles <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (4, 3): Forms triangle with node 7 -> Triangle <3, 4, 7>
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 0): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 8 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 7 -> Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0, 1, and 4 -> Triangles <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 4>
- Edge (7, 6): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6 -> Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 7 and 3 -> Triangle <2, 7, 3>
- Edge (8, 6): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 7 -> Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 7): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6 -> Triangle <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
