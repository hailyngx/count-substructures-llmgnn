Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by their degree:
0 (degree 3)
2 (degree 2)
4 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)
1 (degree 5)
8 (degree 4)
3 (degree 5)
7 (degree 5)
