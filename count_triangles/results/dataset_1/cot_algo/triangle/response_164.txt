Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on the number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we will check the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

Edges to check:
(1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4)
