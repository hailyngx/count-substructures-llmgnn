Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
(5, 1) (8, 2) (4, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (7, 6) (3, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7)

Now, we will go through the edges in the graph where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (4, 6): Shared connection with vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 0): Shared connection with vertex 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (3, 6): Shared connection with vertex 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 9): Shared connection with vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 6, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4].
