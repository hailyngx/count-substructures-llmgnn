Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Sort nodes by their degree in ascending order.
Node 1: degree 0
Node 6: degree 0
Node 7: degree 0
Node 8: degree 0
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6

Step 2: Relabel nodes according to their degree.
Node 1: 0
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 1: 6
Node 4: 7
Node 0: 8
Node 2: 9

Step 3: Count the number of triangles.
Triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>

Total number of triangles: [2]
