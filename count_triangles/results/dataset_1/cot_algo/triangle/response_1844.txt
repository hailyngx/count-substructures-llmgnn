Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 3 connections: 4
2. 4 connections: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
3. 2 connections: 2, 7, 9

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
0 -> 1
1 -> 2
5 -> 3
6 -> 4
8 -> 5
2 -> 6
7 -> 7
9 -> 8

Next, we will examine each edge while considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Checking (0, 4): Both have 4 connections, so we skip.
Checking (0, 5): (0, 5, 6) forms a triangle.
Checking (0, 6): (0, 6, 5) forms a triangle.
Checking (1, 4): (1, 4, 8) forms a triangle.
Checking (2, 7): Both have 2 connections, so we skip.
Checking (4, 8): (4, 8, 6) forms a triangle.
Checking (5, 7): (5, 7, 6) forms a triangle.
Checking (5, 9): Both have 4 connections, so we skip.

There are a total of [4] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, and <5, 7, 6>.
