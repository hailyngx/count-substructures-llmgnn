Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is as follows:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges based on the new ordering of the nodes:

<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
