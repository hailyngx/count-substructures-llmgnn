Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices based on their degree:
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Using the relabeled vertices, the edges are:
(2, 0) (2, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (7, 4) (3, 5) (4, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (8, 9) (5, 3) (3, 0) (5, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 8) (8, 3)

Calculating the number of triangles:
[] Total number of triangles: 12
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, <1, 7, 4>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 1>, <4, 6, 3>, <5, 8, 9>, <9, 5, 8>
