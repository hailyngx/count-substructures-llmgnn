Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new order is: 7, 6, 0, 2, 6, 8, 4, 9, 1, 5. 

Analyzing the given edges based on the new ordering, we find the following triangles: 
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
