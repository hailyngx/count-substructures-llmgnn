Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. 8 (Degree: 0)
2. 1 (Degree: 2)
3. 4 (Degree: 2)
4. 5 (Degree: 1)
5. 7 (Degree: 2)
6. 6 (Degree: 3)
7. 9 (Degree: 4)
8. 2 (Degree: 5)
9. 4 (Degree: 5)
10. 0 (Degree: 6)

Based on the sorting, we will now count the triangles by checking shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <8, 9, 0>

Therefore, there are 10 triangles in total:
