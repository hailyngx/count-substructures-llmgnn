Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we relabel them as follows: 
Node 1 (degree 2), Node 5 (degree 2), Node 3 (degree 2), Node 6 (degree 2), Node 0 (degree 3), Node 7 (degree 3), Node 2 (degree 5), Node 4 (degree 5), Node 8 (degree 1), Node 9 (degree 4).

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph: 
- Node 1 (1) and Node 6 (6) share a connection with Node 7 (7) forming triangle <1, 6, 7>.
- Node 2 (2) and Node 0 (0) share a connection with Node 9 (9) forming triangle <2, 0, 9>.
- Node 2 (2) and Node 4 (4) share connections with Node 6 (6) forming two triangles <2, 4, 6> and <2, 6, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
