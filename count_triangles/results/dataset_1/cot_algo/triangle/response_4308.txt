Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 5 connections.
Vertex 1 has 6 connections.
Vertex 2 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles:
- Triangle <6, 7, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
