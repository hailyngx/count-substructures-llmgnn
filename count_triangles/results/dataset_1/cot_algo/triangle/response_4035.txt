Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertices 3 and 4: 1 connection
Vertices 2 and 5: 2 connections
Vertices 1 and 9: 3 connections
Vertices 0, 7, and 8: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 6 (0 connections): Label as 0
Vertices 3 and 4 (1 connection): Label as 1 and 2
Vertices 2 and 5 (2 connections): Label as 3 and 4
Vertices 1 and 9 (3 connections): Label as 5 and 6
Vertices 0, 7, and 8 (4 connections): Label as 7, 8, and 9

Now, we will check each edge to count the triangles:
- (0, 1): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>
- (0, 4): No triangle
- (0, 7): No triangle
- (0, 8): Forms triangle <0, 7, 8>
- (1, 0): Forms triangle <0, 1, 7>
- (1, 7): No triangle
- (1, 9): No triangle
- (2, 8): No triangle
- (2, 9): No triangle
- (3, 5): No triangle
- (3, 8): No triangle
- (4, 0): No triangle
- (5, 3): No triangle
- (5, 8): No triangle
- (7, 0): No triangle
- (7, 1): No triangle
- (7, 8): No triangle
- (8, 0): Forms triangle <0, 7, 8>
- (8, 2): No triangle
- (8, 3): No triangle
- (8, 5): No triangle
- (8, 7): No triangle
- (8, 9): No triangle
- (9, 1): No triangle
- (9, 2): No triangle
- (9, 8): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 7, 8>
