Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections: 

Vertices: 
0 - Degree 1
1 - Degree 3
2 - Degree 3
3 - Degree 3
4 - Degree 2
5 - Degree 4
6 - Degree 5
7 - Degree 1
8 - Degree 2
9 - Degree 2

Looking at the edges with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we can count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

Triangles:
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 6, 4>
<1, 6, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 8, 0>
<4, 6, 5>
<6, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
