Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by number of connections (degree):
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
