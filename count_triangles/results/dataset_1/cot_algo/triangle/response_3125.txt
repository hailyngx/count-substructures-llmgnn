Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 1 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 6)
Node 2 (Degree 6)
Node 4 (Degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges using the sorted vertices. 

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (0, 1): Shared connections with 2 and 4 forming triangles <0, 1, 2> and <0, 1, 4>.
- (0, 2): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- (0, 4): No new triangles.
- (0, 7): No triangle with Node 7 having only one connection.
- (1, 3): No new triangles.
- (1, 5): Shared connection with 2 forming triangle <1, 5, 2>.
- (1, 8): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <1, 8, 4>.
- (2, 4): No new triangles.
- (2, 5): No new triangles.
- (2, 9): Shared connection with 4 forming triangle <2, 9, 4>.
- (3, 6): No new triangles.
- (3, 9): No new triangles.
- (4, 8): Shared connection with 1 forming triangle <4, 8, 1>.
- (4, 9): No new triangles.

Counting the total number of triangles = 5
The unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 8, 4>

The final output is [5].
