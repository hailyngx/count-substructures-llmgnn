Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting nodes by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. Then, we relabel the nodes accordingly. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their degrees:

Node 4: 1
Node 6: 1
Node 1: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 5: 3
Node 9: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 3: 5
Node 0: 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Starting from edges with nodes of lower degree:

1. Edge (0, 4) (with nodes 0 and 4) has no triangles.
2. Edge (0, 9) (with nodes 0 and 9) forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
3. Edge (1, 7) (with nodes 1 and 7) forms a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
4. Edge (2, 5) (with nodes 2 and 5) has no triangles.
5. Edge (2, 6) (with nodes 2 and 6) has no triangles.
6. Edge (3, 5) (with nodes 3 and 5) has no triangles.
7. Edge (4, 0) (with nodes 4 and 0) has no triangles.
8. Edge (5, 2) (with nodes 5 and 2) has no triangles.
9. Edge (6, 2) (with nodes 6 and 2) has no triangles.
10. Edge (7, 1) (with nodes 7 and 1) forms a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
11. Edge (8, 0) (with nodes 8 and 0) forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
12. Edge (9, 0) (with nodes 9 and 0) forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.

There are 5 triangles in total, which are:

<0, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
