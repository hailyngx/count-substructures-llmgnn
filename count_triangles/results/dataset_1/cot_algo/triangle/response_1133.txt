Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge based on the ordering of vertices:

<1, 5> does not form a triangle.
<5, 9> does not form a triangle.
<1, 9> does not form a triangle.
<2, 1> does not form a triangle.
<5, 1> does not form a triangle.
<9, 1> does not form a triangle.
<5, 2> does not form a triangle.
<2, 6> does not form a triangle.
<6, 8> does not form a triangle.
<1, 3> forms triangle <1, 3, 4>.
<1, 7> does not form a triangle.
<5, 4> forms triangle <1, 4, 5>.
<2, 0> does not form a triangle.
<5, 6> does not form a triangle.
<6, 0> does not form a triangle.
<9, 0> does not form a triangle.
<9, 1> does not form a triangle.
<3, 2> does not form a triangle.
<9, 4> forms triangle <1, 4, 9>.
<6, 3> forms triangle <1, 3, 6>.
<6, 0> does not form a triangle.
<6, 8> does not form a triangle.
<7, 0> forms triangle <0, 4, 7>.
<7, 1> does not form a triangle.
<5, 4> does not form a triangle.
<8, 2> does not form a triangle.
<3, 2> does not form a triangle.
<8, 6> does not form a triangle.
<7, 8> does not form a triangle.
<0, 9> does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, and <0, 4, 7>.
