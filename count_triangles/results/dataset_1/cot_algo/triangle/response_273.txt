Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 1: 6 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections
- Node 2: 6 connections

Now, we can count the triangles by examining each edge:

For edge (0, 2):
- Shared connections are with node 6
- Triangle: <0, 2, 6>

For edge (0, 6):
- Shared connections are with nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>

For edge (0, 7):
- Shared connection is with node 4
- Triangle: <0, 6, 4>

For edge (1, 2):
- No triangles are formed

For edge (1, 4):
- Shared connection is with node 6
- Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

For edge (1, 5):
- No triangles are formed

For edge (1, 6):
- Shared connection is with node 4
- Triangle: <1, 4, 6>

For edge (1, 8):
- No triangles are formed

For edge (2, 5):
- Shared connection is with node 1
- Triangle: <2, 1, 5>

For edge (3, 5):
- No triangles are formed

For edge (4, 7):
- Shared connection is with node 6
- Triangle: <4, 6, 7>

For edge (6, 8):
- No triangles are formed

For edge (7, 9):
- No triangles are formed

Counting the total number of triangles: [6]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 1, 5>, <4, 6, 7>.
