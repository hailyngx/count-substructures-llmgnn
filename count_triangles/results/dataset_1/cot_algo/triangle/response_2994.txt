Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices in order:
1. Vertex 6 (no connections)
2. Vertex 1 (2 connections)
3. Vertex 4 (2 connections)
4. Vertex 2 (2 connections)
5. Vertex 9 (2 connections)
6. Vertex 7 (3 connections)
7. Vertex 3 (3 connections)
8. Vertex 8 (3 connections)
9. Vertex 5 (4 connections)
10. Vertex 10 (5 connections)

Next, we will go through each edge (u, v) and check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Count the triangles formed by shared connections.

Triangles found: 
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
