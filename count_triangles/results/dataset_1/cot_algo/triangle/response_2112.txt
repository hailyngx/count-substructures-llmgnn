Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's rearrange the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 0 has degree 1
Vertex's 1, 4, and 9 have degree 1
Vertex's 2 and 6 have degree 1
Vertex's 3 and 8 have degree 2
Vertex's 7 has degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of their degree:
Vertex 0 (degree 1) will become vertex 0
Vertices 1, 4, and 9 will become vertices 1, 2, and 3
Vertices 2 and 6 will become vertices 4 and 5
Vertices 3 and 8 will become vertices 6 and 7
Vertex 7 will become vertex 8

The edges in the updated graph are now: (0, 3) (1, 5) (4, 6) (4, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 6) (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles based on the new vertex labeling:
- Vertex 0 (0) is connected to Vertex 3 (6) and forms a triangle with Vertex 1 (1) via Vertex 5 (4) <0, 1, 5>
- Vertex 1 (1) is connected to Vertex 5 (4) and forms a triangle with Vertex 3 (6) via Vertex 4 (6) <1, 3, 4>
- Vertex 3 (6) is connected to Vertex 7 (8) and forms two triangles with Vertex 1 (1) and Vertex 5 (4) via Vertex 4 (6) and Vertex 5 (4) <1, 3, 5> <1, 3, 4>
- Vertex 4 (7) is connected to Vertex 6 (8) and forms a triangle with Vertex 1 (2) via Vertex 2 (3) <1, 2, 3>
- Vertex 6 (8) is connected to Vertex 7 (8) and forms two triangles with Vertex 1 (1) and Vertex 5 (4) via Vertex 3 (6) and Vertex 4 (6) <1, 5, 6> <1, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 3, 6>
