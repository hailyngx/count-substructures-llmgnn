Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled based on their number of connections:

Vertex 5 (Degree 1)
Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 1 (Degree 0)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
Vertex 7 (Degree 5)
Vertex 8 (Degree 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree 6)

Now, starting with the edge with the vertex of lower label having fewer connections, we will count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [8]
