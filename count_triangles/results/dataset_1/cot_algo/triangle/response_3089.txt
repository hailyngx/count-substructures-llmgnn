Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 1: 0 connections  
Vertex 7: 1 connection  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 4 connections  
Vertex 4: 5 connections  
Vertex 3: 6 connections  
Vertex 9: 7 connections  
Vertex 0: 7 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles and list them in <>.

There are 16 triangles in total:
[16]  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 4, 8>  
<0, 7, 9>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<2, 3, 9>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<3, 0, 9>  
<3, 1, 5>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 9>  
<4, 0, 5>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<4, 5, 8>  
<5, 2, 8>  
<5, 3, 9>  
<7, 0, 9>
