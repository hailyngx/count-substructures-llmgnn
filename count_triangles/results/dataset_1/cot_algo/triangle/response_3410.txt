Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new numbering of the nodes is as follows:  

Vertex 0 has degree 4  
Vertex 1 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 3 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 4  
Vertex 4 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  

Following the degree-based ordering method, we analyze the edges in the order given.

Analyzing edge (0, 3): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (0, 5): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (0, 6): They share a connection at vertex 3.  
Analyzing edge (0, 7): They share connections at vertices 4 and 9.  
Analyzing edge (1, 8): They share a connection at vertex 4.  
Analyzing edge (1, 9): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (2, 3): They share connections at vertices 0 and 5.  
Analyzing edge (2, 4): They share connections at vertices 5 and 3.  
Analyzing edge (2, 5): They share connections at vertices 0, 4, and 9.  
Analyzing edge (2, 9): They share connections at vertices 5 and 1.  
Analyzing edge (3, 0): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (3, 2): They share connections at vertices 0 and 5.  
Analyzing edge (3, 5): They share connections at vertices 0, 2, and 4.  
Analyzing edge (3, 6): They share a connection at vertex 0.  
Analyzing edge (4, 2): They share connections at vertices 5 and 3.  
Analyzing edge (4, 5): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (4, 7): They share a connection at vertex 0.  
Analyzing edge (4, 8): They share a connection at vertex 1.  
Analyzing edge (5, 0): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (5, 2): They share connections at vertices 0 and 4.  
Analyzing edge (5, 3): They share connections at vertices 0, 2, and 4.  
Analyzing edge (5, 4): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (5, 9): They share connections at vertices 0, 2, and 7.  
Analyzing edge (6, 0): They share a connection at vertex 3.  
Analyzing edge (6, 3): They share a connection at vertex 0.  
Analyzing edge (7, 0): They share connections at vertices 4 and 9.  
Analyzing edge (7, 4): They share a connection at vertex 0.  
Analyzing edge (7, 8): They share a connection at vertex 1.  
Analyzing edge (7, 9): They share a connection at vertex 0.  
Analyzing edge (8, 1): They share a connection at vertex 4.  
Analyzing edge (8, 4): They share a connection at vertex 1.  
Analyzing edge (8, 7): They share a connection at vertex 1.  
Analyzing edge (9, 1): They share a connection at vertex 2.  
Analyzing edge (9, 2): They share a connection at vertex 5.  
Analyzing edge (9, 5): They share connections at vertices 0, 2, and 7.  
Analyzing edge (9, 7): They share a connection at vertex 0.  

Thus, there are a total of [9] triangles in the graph:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 9>, <0, 4, 7>.
