Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their number of connections are:  
Node 9: connects with 1 other node.  
Node 0: connects with 4 other nodes.  
Node 6: connects with 4 other nodes.  
Node 8: connects with 4 other nodes.  
Node 5: connects with 5 other nodes.  
Node 3: connects with 6 other nodes.  
Node 2: connects with 6 other nodes.  
Node 1: connects with 7 other nodes.  
Node 4: connects with 7 other nodes.  
Node 7: connects with 8 other nodes.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
Total number of triangles: [24]
List of unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 5, 7>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 5>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 6, 9>, <8, 5, 9>, <9, 7, 8>
