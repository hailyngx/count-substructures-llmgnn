Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new numbering of the vertices is as follows:  

0 -> 5 connections  
1 -> 5 connections  
2 -> 3 connections  
3 -> 3 connections  
4 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 2 connections  
6 -> 5 connections  
7 -> 2 connections  
8 -> 2 connections  
9 -> 4 connections  

Using this ordering, we will check for triangles based on the shared connections between vertices:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle 3: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle 5: <1, 9, 3>
- Triangle 6: <2, 6, 4>
- Triangle 7: <4, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
