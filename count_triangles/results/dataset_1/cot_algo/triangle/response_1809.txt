Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method will be applied on the given graph with 10 nodes and 48 edges.

After sorting the nodes based on their degrees from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 0: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6
Node 3: degree 7
Node 8: degree 7

Going through the edges based on the degree ordering, we find the following triangles:
<3, 0, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
