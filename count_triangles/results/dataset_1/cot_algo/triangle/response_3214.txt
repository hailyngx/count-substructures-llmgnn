Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices and their degrees:  
1. 1 (degree 1)  
2. 3, 7, 8 (degree 2)  
3. 0, 4, 5, 9 (degree 4)  
4. 6 (degree 3)  

We will now relabel the vertices accordingly:  
1 → 0  
3, 7, 8 → 1  
0, 4, 5, 9 → 2  
6 → 3  

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  
Considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
(1, 9): No triangle formed  
(3, 6): No triangle formed  
(5, 6): No triangle formed  
(1, 2): Triangle formed <1, 2, 9>  
(1, 7): No triangle formed  
(2, 8): No triangle formed  
(0, 4): Triangle formed <0, 4, 5>  
(0, 7): No triangle formed  

Total number of triangles: [2]  
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 5>
