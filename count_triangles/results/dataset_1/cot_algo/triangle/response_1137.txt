Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:
- The vertices are sorted based on the number of connections:
    - Vertex 6 has 0 connections.
    - Vertices 7 and 0 have 1 connection each.
    - Vertices 1, 6, and 9 have 2 connections each.
    - Vertices 3 and 8 have 3 connections each.
    - Vertex 4 has 7 connections.
    - Vertex 2 has 8 connections.
- We will now check the edges in the order that ensures we count each triangle only once.

Starting with the edges:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have 1 connection and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Both vertices have 1 connection and share vertex 2, forming a triangle <0, 4, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 has 1 connection while vertex 8 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertices 0 and 2, forming two triangles <1, 4, 0> and <1, 4, 2>.
6. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 2 connections while vertex 8 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
8. Edge (2, 4): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertices 0 and 1, forming two triangles <2, 4, 0> and <2, 4, 1>.
9. Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <2, 5, 4>.
10. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 2 connections while vertex 9 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (3, 1): Both vertices have 3 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <3, 1, 4>.
12. Edge (3, 2): Both vertices have 3 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <3, 2, 4>.
13. Edge (3, 4): Both vertices have 3 connections and share vertices 0 and 1, forming two triangles <3, 4, 0> and <3, 4, 1>.
14. Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has 3 connections while vertex 9 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (4, 0): Both vertices have 7 connections and share vertices 2 and 3, forming two triangles <4, 0, 2> and <4, 0, 3>.
16. Edge (4, 1): Both vertices have 7 connections and share vertex 3, forming a triangle <4, 1, 3>.
17. Edge (4, 2): Both vertices have 7 connections and share vertices 0 and 3, forming two triangles <4, 2, 0> and <4, 2, 3>.
18. Edge (4, 3): Both vertices have 7 connections and share vertices 1 and 2, forming two triangles <4, 3, 1> and <4, 3, 2>.
19. Edge (4, 5): Both vertices have 7 connections and share vertex 2, forming a triangle <4, 5, 2>.
20. Edge (5, 2): Both vertices have 3 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <5, 2, 4>.
21. Edge (5, 4): Both vertices have 3 connections and share vertices 0 and 2, forming two triangles <5, 4, 0> and <5, 4, 2>.
22. Edge (5, 8): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertex 4, forming a triangle <5, 8, 4>.
23. Edge (8, 0): Vertex 8 has 2 connections while vertex 0 has 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
24. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 8 has 2 connections while vertex 1 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
25. Edge (8, 5): Vertex 8 has 2 connections while vertex 5 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
26. Edge (9, 2): Both vertices have 2 connections and share vertex 3, forming a triangle <9, 2, 3>.
27. Edge (9, 3): Vertex 9 has 2 connections while vertex 3 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
