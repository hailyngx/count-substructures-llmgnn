Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 

Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 1 has degree 4  
Vertex 2 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 4  
Vertex 5 has degree 2  
Vertex 6 has degree 2  
Vertex 7 has degree 2  
Vertex 8 has degree 5  
Vertex 9 has degree 2  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing the given edges based on the method mentioned, we find the following triangles:

- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Triangle <8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
