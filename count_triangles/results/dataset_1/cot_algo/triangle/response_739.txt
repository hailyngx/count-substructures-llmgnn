Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 with 5 connections
- Vertex 1 with 4 connections
- Vertex 3 with 4 connections
- Vertex 4 with 5 connections
- Vertex 6 with 4 connections
- Vertex 5 with 4 connections
- Vertex 7 with 5 connections
- Vertex 8 with 4 connections
- Vertex 2 with 1 connection

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges only from vertices with lower labels to vertices with higher labels. Checking these edges for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
