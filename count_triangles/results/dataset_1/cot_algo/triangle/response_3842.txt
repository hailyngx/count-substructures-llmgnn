Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 2, 7, 9, 0, 7, 3, 6, 6, 6, 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertices: 0(2), 1(7), 2(5), 3(6), 4(6), 5(6), 6(7), 7(0), 8(7), 9(3)

Next, we will count the number of triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<6, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 5>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
