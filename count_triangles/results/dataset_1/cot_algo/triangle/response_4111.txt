Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 7 connections.

Using the sorted list of nodes by the number of connections, we can now count the triangles:

1. Node 0 - Node 7: Forms 0 triangles.
2. Node 3 - Node 5: Forms 2 triangles: <3, 5, 2>, <3, 5, 8>.
3. Node 6 - Node 1: Forms 1 triangle: <6, 1, 4>.
4. Node 6 - Node 9: Forms 1 triangle: <6, 9, 1>.
5. Node 5 - Node 2: Forms 2 triangles: <5, 2, 7>, <5, 2, 8>.
6. Node 5 - Node 8: Forms 2 triangles: <5, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 2>.
7. Node 4 - Node 1: Forms 1 triangle: <4, 1, 7>.
8. Node 8 - Node 4: Forms 1 triangle: <8, 4, 1>.
9. Node 8 - Node 5: Forms 2 triangles: <8, 5, 3>, <8, 5, 2>.
10. Node 2 - Node 7: Forms 2 triangles: <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 3>.
11. Node 2 - Node 8: Forms 2 triangles: <2, 8, 1>, <2, 8, 4>.
12. Node 2 - Node 9: Forms 1 triangle: <2, 9, 1>.
13. Node 9 - Node 1: Forms 1 triangle: <9, 1, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
