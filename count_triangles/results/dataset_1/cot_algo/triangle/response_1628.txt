Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:  
Node 3 < Node 6 < Node 9 < Node 4 < Node 8 < Node 5 < Node 1 < Node 0 < Node 2 < Node 7

After sorting the edges according to the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections, we get:
(3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7)

Counting the triangles formed by the shared connections for the given graph, we find:
[9]

The unique triangles are:
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 5>
<9, 1, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<3, 8, 0>
<9, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 0>
