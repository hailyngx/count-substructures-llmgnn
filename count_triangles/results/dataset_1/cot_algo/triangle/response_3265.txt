Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 has degree 2,
Node 4 has degree 2,
Node 9 has degree 2,
Node 5 has degree 3,
Node 3 has degree 4,
Node 8 has degree 4,
Node 1 has degree 5,
Node 7 has degree 5, and
Node 2 has degree 6.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <1, 7, 2>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 8) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (2, 3) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (2, 7) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <1, 2, 8>.
- Edge (3, 4) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (5, 7) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (7, 2) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (7, 5) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (8, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 2, 8>.
- Edge (8, 2) does not add any triangles.
- Edge (8, 9) does not add any triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <1, 7, 2>, <1, 2, 8>.
