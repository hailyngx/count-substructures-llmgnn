Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
1. Node 1 - 1 connection
2. Node 7 - 1 connection
3. Node 5 - 2 connections
4. Node 8 - 3 connections
5. Node 4 - 3 connections
6. Node 6 - 4 connections
7. Node 9 - 5 connections
8. Node 2 - 5 connections
9. Node 3 - 5 connections
10. Node 0 - 6 connections
