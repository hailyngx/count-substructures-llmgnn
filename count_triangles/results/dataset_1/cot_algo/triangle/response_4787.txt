Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Let's do that:

Vertex 2 has 0 connection(s).
Vertex 4 has 1 connection(s).
Vertices 3, 5, and 8 have 2 connection(s).
Vertices 0, 6, and 7 have 3 connection(s).
Vertex 1 has 5 connection(s).
Vertex 9 has 6 connection(s).

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and Vertex 1 has 5 connections.
2. Edge (0, 9): Only Vertex 0 has fewer connections, so we check for shared connections.
   Shared connections: 5
   Triangle: <0, 1, 9>
3. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 5 connections, which is more than Vertex 3's 2 connections.
4. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has 5 connections and Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
5. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has 5 connections and Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
6. Edge (1, 6): This has already been considered.
7. Edge (3, 1): This has already been considered.
8. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 has 1 connection and Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections: None
9. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 2 connections and Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
10. Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have 2 connections, no triangles from this edge.
11. Edge (6, 4): This has already been considered.
12. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 3 connections and Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
   Shared connections: None
13. Edge (7, 5): This has already been considered.
14. Edge (7, 6): This has already been considered.
15. Edge (7, 9): Both vertices have 3 connections, no triangles from this edge.
16. Edge (8, 1): This has already been considered.
17. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 2 connections and Vertex 9 has 6 connections.
   Shared connections: 1
   Triangle: <8, 1, 9>
18. Edge (9, 0): Vertex 9 has 6 connections, which is more than Vertex 0's 3 connections.
19. Edge (9, 5): Both vertices have 2 connections, no triangles from this edge.
20. Edge (9, 7): Both vertices have 3 connections, no triangles from this edge.
21. Edge (9, 8): This has already been considered.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 9>, <8, 1, 9>
