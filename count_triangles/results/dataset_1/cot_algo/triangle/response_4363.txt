Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 5 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0, 5, and 8 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 7 and 2 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 3 and 8 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 4 and 6 have 5 connections each.

Now, let's count the number of triangles:
- Triangle <1, 9, 4> (formed by edge (1, 4), (1, 9), and (4, 9)).
- Triangle <6, 7, 1> (formed by edge (6, 1), (6, 7), and (1, 7)).
- Triangle <6, 7, 9> (formed by edge (6, 7), (6, 9), and (7, 9)).

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
