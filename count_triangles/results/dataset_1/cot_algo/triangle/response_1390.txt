Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees:

Vertices: 
0 - Degree 5
1 - Degree 3
2 - Degree 2
3 - Degree 6
4 - Degree 6
5 - Degree 4
6 - Degree 4
7 - Degree 4
8 - Degree 4
9 - Degree 5

Since vertex 2 has the lowest degree, it will be relabeled as 0. 
Vertices: 
2 -> 0
1 -> 1
5 -> 2
6 -> 3
7 -> 4
8 -> 5
9 -> 6
0 -> 7
3 -> 8
4 -> 9

The relabeled edges: 
(0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7)

We can now count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [24]

Unique triangles:

<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
