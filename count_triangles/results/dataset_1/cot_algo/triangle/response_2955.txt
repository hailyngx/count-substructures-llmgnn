Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
1. Vertex 1: Degree: 1
2. Vertex 6: Degree: 1
3. Vertex 7: Degree: 1
4. Vertex 4: Degree: 2
5. Vertex 9: Degree: 2
6. Vertex 5: Degree: 3
7. Vertex 0: Degree: 4
8. Vertex 8: Degree: 4
9. Vertex 3: Degree: 5
10. Vertex 2: Degree: 3

Now, we will examine each edge, making sure to consider only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
