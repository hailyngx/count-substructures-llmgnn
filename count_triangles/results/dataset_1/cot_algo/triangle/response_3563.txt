Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by the number of connections:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 4 and 7 have 0 connections.
- Nodes 5 and 7 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, and 8 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 2 and 6 have 4 connections.
