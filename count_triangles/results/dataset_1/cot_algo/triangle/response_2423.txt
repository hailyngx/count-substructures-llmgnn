Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we'll calculate the degree of each vertex:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, we'll sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Sorted nodes: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4, 7, 0, 8

Next, we'll relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on the sorted order:
Node 1 -> 0
Node 2 -> 1
Node 3 -> 2
Node 6 -> 3
Node 9 -> 4
Node 5 -> 5
Node 4 -> 6
Node 7 -> 7
Node 0 -> 8
Node 8 -> 9

Now, we'll go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
- Edge (0, 1): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with node 7 -> triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (0, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (1, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with node 0 -> triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (4, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 3): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with node 0 -> triangle <0, 4, 7>
- Edge (8, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 5): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 2): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 5): Does not form a triangle

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>
