Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in increasing order and relabeling them accordingly, the new edge list is as follows:
(8, 1) (5, 8) (0, 8) (6, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (7, 3) (2, 2) (1, 1) (9, 2) (2, 2) (6, 2) (1, 5) (0, 5) (8, 5) (4, 6) (8, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (8, 7) (0, 8) (5, 8) (1, 8) (7, 8) (2, 8) (8, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (8, 9)

By examining the new edge list, we can find the triangles formed by shared connections:
1. <0, 5, 8>
2. <0, 7, 8>
3. <0, 8, 5>
4. <2, 7, 8>
5. <2, 8, 7>
6. <5, 8, 0>
7. <7, 0, 8>
8. <8, 0, 7>
9. <8, 2, 7>
10. <8, 5, 0>
11. <8, 7, 0>
12. <8, 7, 2>
13. <8, 8, 5>
14. <8, 8, 6>
15. <8, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
