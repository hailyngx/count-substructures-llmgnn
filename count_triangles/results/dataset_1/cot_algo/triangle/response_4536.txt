Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 7 is the least connected with degree 2
- Nodes 1, 5, 9 are next with degree 3
- Nodes 0, 8 are next with degree 4
- Nodes 4, 6 are next with degree 5
- Node 3 has the most connections with degree 6

Now, we examine each edge starting from the one with the vertex with the lowest degree:

1. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 6>.
6. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (5, 8): Forms triangle <5, 6, 8>.
8. Edge (0, 4): Forms triangle <0, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 6): Forms triangle <3, 6, 8>.
11. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle <2, 0, 4>.
14. Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle <2, 3, 6>.
15. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (4, 0): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (6, 3): Forms triangle <6, 3, 5>.
21. Edge (6, 8): Forms triangle <6, 5, 8>.
22. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] with unique triangles <0, 3, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 4>, <3, 6, 8>, and <2, 3, 6>.
