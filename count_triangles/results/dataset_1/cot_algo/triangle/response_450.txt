Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 9 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering approach to count the number of triangles, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 2) (1, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 5) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5)

With this method, we identify the following triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
