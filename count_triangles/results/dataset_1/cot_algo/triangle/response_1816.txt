Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 2 connections
1: 0 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 6 connections
9: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their sorted degrees:

0: 1 connections
1: 0 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 1 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 3 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Since we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will focus on the following edges:
(0, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (8, 9)

By checking for shared connections for each of these edges, we can find the total number of triangles and list them uniquely:

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>
