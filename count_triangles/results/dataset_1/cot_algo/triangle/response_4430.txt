Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method steps are as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
   Vertices in order: 7, 0, 7, 9, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Sorted vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Now we can count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 6):
   No shared connections.

2. Edge (1, 4):
   Shared connection with vertex 5.
   Triangle <1, 4, 5>.

3. Edge (1, 5):
   No shared connections.

4. Edge (1, 8):
   No shared connections.

5. Edge (1, 9):
   No shared connections.

6. Edge (2, 3):
   No shared connections.

7. Edge (2, 4):
   Shared connection with vertex 5.
   Triangle <2, 4, 5>.

8. Edge (2, 5):
   No shared connections.

9. Edge (3, 2):
   No shared connections.

10. Edge (3, 5):
    Shared connection with vertex 8.
    Triangle <3, 5, 8>.

11. Edge (3, 8):
    No shared connections.

12. Edge (4, 1):
    Shared connection with vertex 5.
    Triangle <1, 4, 5>.

13. Edge (4, 2):
    Shared connection with vertex 5.
    Triangle <2, 4, 5>.

14. Edge (5, 1):
    No shared connections.

15. Edge (5, 2):
    No shared connections.

16. Edge (5, 3):
    Shared connection with vertex 8.
    Triangle <3, 5, 8>.

17. Edge (5, 8):
    No shared connections.

18. Edge (6, 0):
    No shared connections.

19. Edge (6, 9):
    No shared connections.

20. Edge (8, 1):
    No shared connections.

21. Edge (8, 3):
    No shared connections.

22. Edge (8, 5):
    No shared connections.

23. Edge (9, 1):
    No shared connections.

24. Edge (9, 6):
    No shared connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is: [3]
The unique triangles found are: <1, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 8>.
