Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most connections):
- Node 2 ⟶ Node 0
- Node 3 ⟶ Node 1
- Node 7 ⟶ Node 2
- Node 8 ⟶ Node 3
- Node 9 ⟶ Node 4
- Node 1 ⟶ Node 5
- Node 6 ⟶ Node 6
- Node 5 ⟶ Node 7
- Node 4 ⟶ Node 8
- Node 0 ⟶ Node 9

Next, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 6>

Therefore, there are [5] triangles in the given graph.
