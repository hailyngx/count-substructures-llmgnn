Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 7

After arranging the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:

Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Node 5 (Degree 3) -> Node 8 (Degree 3) -> Node 1 (Degree 4) -> Node 6 (Degree 4) -> Node 7 (Degree 4) -> Node 2 (Degree 5) -> Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Node 4 (Degree 5) -> Node 9 (Degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles: 

<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 9, 1>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [17]
