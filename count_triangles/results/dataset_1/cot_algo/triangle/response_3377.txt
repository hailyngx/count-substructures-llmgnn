Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labeling of vertices is:
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 1  
Node 8 has degree 2  
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 4  
Node 7 has degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider the edges starting with vertices with lower labels and fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles, we get:
[]
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
