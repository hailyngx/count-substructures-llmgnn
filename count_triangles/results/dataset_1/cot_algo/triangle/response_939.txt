Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 4 - 2 connections
Nodes 6, 8 - 3 connections
Nodes 5, 7, 9 - 4 connections
Nodes 1, 3 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections
Node 0 - 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): The shared connection is with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (0, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (0, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 0): The shared connection is with node 3, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (1, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 3): The shared connection is with node 5, forming a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- For edge (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (3, 0): The shared connection is with node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (3, 1): The shared connection is with node 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (3, 2): The shared connection is with node 5, forming a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- For edge (3, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- For edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed.
