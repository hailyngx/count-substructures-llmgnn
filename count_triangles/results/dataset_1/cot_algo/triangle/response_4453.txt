Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, we get the following relabeling:  
Vertices: 0, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 4, 7, 2

After sorting the edges based on the vertices with the lower label having fewer connections, we have the following connections to examine for triangles:

(0, 9), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)

There are 3 triangles in this graph:
[6, 2, 4], [6, 3, 7], [8, 5, 7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
