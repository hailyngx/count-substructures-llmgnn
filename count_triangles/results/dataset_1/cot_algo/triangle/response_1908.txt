Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labels are as follows:
0 - 4 connections
1 - 1 connection
2 - 3 connections
3 - 4 connections
4 - 5 connections
5 - 6 connections
6 - 3 connections
8 - 3 connections
9 - 5 connections

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges involving vertices with lower labels having fewer connections. 

Proceeding with the edges:
(0, 4) - common connections with 5, 8
(0, 5) - common connection with 4
(0, 8) - common connection with 3, 4
(2, 5) - common connection with 0
(2, 6) - no triangles
(2, 9) - common connection with 3
(3, 4) - common connections with 0, 5, 8
(3, 5) - common connections with 0, 4
(3, 8) - common connections with 0, 4
(4, 5) - common connections with 0, 3
(5, 6) - no triangles
(5, 9) - common connection with 0
(8, 3) - common connection with 0
(9, 6) - no triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 9, and the unique triangles are:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 8, 3>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 4>
