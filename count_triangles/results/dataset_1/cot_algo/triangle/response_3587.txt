Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting triangles efficiently. First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5 has 1 connection.
Nodes 3 and 5 have 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 have 2 connections.
Nodes 0 and 8 have 4 connections.
Node 7 has 8 connections.

Next, relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 3 (0 connections) → Node 0
Node 5 (1 connection) → Node 1
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 (2 connections) → Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Nodes 0, 8 (4 connections) → Nodes 7, 8
Node 7 (8 connections) → Node 9

Now, let's list the edges according to the relabeling:
(0, 9) (7, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7)

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 4>
