Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 0 and 1 are 9 and 7. So, the triangle is <0, 1, 7>.
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0 and 2 are 9. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 9>.
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles as node 6 has only 2 connections.
- Edge (0, 7): Shared connection with 0 and 7 is 3. So, the triangle is <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (0, 9): Shared connection with 0 and 9 is 2. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 9>.
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with 1 and 3 is 7. So, the triangle is <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles as node 4 has only 1 connection.
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles as node 5 has only 2 connections.
- Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with 2 and 8 are 3 and 9. So, the triangle is <2, 3, 9>.
- Edge (2, 9): Shared connection with 2 and 9 is 0. So, the triangle is <0, 2, 9>.
- Edge (3, 7): Shared connection with 3 and 7 is 0. So, the triangle is <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connection with 3 and 8 is 2. So, the triangle is <2, 3, 8>.
- Edge (5, 7): No triangles as node 5 has only 2 connections.
- Edge (6, 9): Shared connection with 6 and 9 is 0. So, the triangle is <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles as node 5 has only 2 connections.
- Edge (8, 3): Shared connection with 8 and 3 is 2. So, the triangle is <2, 3, 8>.
- Edge (8, 9): Shared connection with 8 and 9 is 2. So, the triangle is <2, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 6): Shared connection with 9 and 6 is 0. So, the triangle is <0, 6, 9>.

Count of triangles = 9
Total number of triangles: [9]
