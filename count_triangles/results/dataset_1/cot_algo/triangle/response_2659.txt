Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 4: 0 edges
- Node 5: 1 edge
- Node 6: 1 edge
- Node 9: 1 edge
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges

Now, we will proceed by checking the edges starting from the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections:
1. Node 1 (2 edges) - Node 6 (1 edge): No triangle formed.
2. Node 1 (2 edges) - Node 7 (2 edges): Formed triangle <1, 6, 7>.
3. Node 2 (3 edges) - Node 3 (2 edges): No triangle formed.
4. Node 2 (3 edges) - Node 8 (4 edges): Formed triangle <2, 3, 8>.
5. Node 3 (2 edges) - Node 9 (1 edge): No triangle formed.
6. Node 5 (1 edge) - Node 8 (4 edges): No triangle formed.

Count of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 8>
