Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have the following labels for each node:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we observe the following edges to count triangles:
(0, 5):
   - Shared connections with 5: 3, 6
   - Shared connections with 0: 9
   - Triangle found with nodes: <0, 5, 6>
(0, 6):
   - Shared connections with 6: 8
   - Triangle found with nodes: <0, 5, 6>
(0, 9):
   - Shared connections with 9: 2
   - Triangle found with nodes: <0, 5, 9>
(1, 4):
   - No triangles found
(1, 7):
   - Shared connections with 7: 3
   - Triangle found with nodes: <1, 7, 3>
(2, 8):
   - Shared connections with 8: 5
   - Triangle found with nodes: <2, 8, 5>
(2, 9):
   - Shared connections with 9: 3
   - Triangle found with nodes: <2, 9, 3>
(3, 5):
   - Shared connections with 5: 0, 7
   - Shared connections with 3: 9
   - Triangle found with nodes: <3, 5, 0> and <3, 5, 7> and <3, 5, 9>
(3, 7):
   - Shared connections with 7: 1, 5
   - Shared connections with 3: 9
   - Triangle found with nodes: <3, 7, 1> and <3, 7, 5> and <3, 7, 9>
(3, 9):
   - Shared connections with 9: 0, 2, 3
   - Triangle found with nodes: <3, 5, 9> and <3, 7, 9>
(5, 7):
   - Shared connections with 7: 1, 3
   - Triangle found with nodes: <5, 7, 1> and <5, 7, 3>
(5, 8):
   - Shared connections with 8: 2
   - Triangle found with nodes: <5, 8, 2>
(6, 8):
   - Shared connections with 8: 5
   - Triangle found with nodes: <6, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11], and the unique triangles are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 7, 3>, <2, 8, 5>, <2, 9, 3>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 7, 5>, and <3, 7, 9>.
