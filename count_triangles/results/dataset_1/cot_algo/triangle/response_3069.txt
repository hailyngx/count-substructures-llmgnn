Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertices: 7, 4, 8, 0, 3, 1, 5, 9, 2

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
