Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles. Let's begin by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices: \[2, 1, 9, 6, 7, 5, 3, 8, 4, 0\]

Based on the given edges, we can identify the shared connections and count the triangles:

1. Vertex 2 - No triangles
2. Vertex 1 - No triangles
3. Vertex 9 - No triangles
4. Vertex 6 - No triangles
5. Vertex 7 - No triangles
6. Vertex 5 - No triangles
7. Vertex 3 - No triangles
8. Vertex 8 - No triangles
9. Vertex 4 - <0, 3, 5>
10. Vertex 0 - <3, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is \[2\] and the unique triangles found are \[<0, 3, 5>, <4, 6, 7>\].
