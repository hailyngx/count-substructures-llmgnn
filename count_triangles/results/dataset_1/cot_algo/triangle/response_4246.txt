Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is: 
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 5 connections

Based on the ordering, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (5, 7)

Now, let's find the triangles formed by the shared connections in the edges:

1. <1, 2, 4>
2. <1, 3, 5>
3. <2, 3, 9>
4. <3, 5, 7>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
