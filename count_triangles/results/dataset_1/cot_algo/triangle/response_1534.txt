Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling will be:
Node 4 has degree 1,
Nodes 2 and 6 have degree 2,
Nodes 5 and 8 have degree 3,
Nodes 1 and 9 have degree 5,
Nodes 0 and 7 have degree 6,
Node 3 has degree 7.

Following the degree-based ordering, we will check each edge based on the condition that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Upon checking the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
