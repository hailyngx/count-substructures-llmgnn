Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, the sorted vertices are:
```
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 1: 8 connections
```

By following the edges and considering only the cases where the lower labeled node has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles.

The total number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [6].
The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
