Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degrees:
0: 1
1: 3
2: 3
3: 3
4: 1
5: 3
6: 3
7: 4
8: 2
9: 3

Now, we will relabel the vertices in increasing order of degrees:

Vertices by labels:
0 → 0
4 → 1
8 → 2
5 → 3
9 → 4
2 → 5
6 → 6
1 → 7
3 → 8
7 → 9

Next, we will count the number of triangles:

Triangles: 3

[3] 
Unique triangles: <1, 7, 9> <2, 5, 6> <3, 6, 7>
