Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabel them accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are:
Node 4 --> Degree: 0
Node 1 --> Degree: 1
Node 9 --> Degree: 1
Node 3 --> Degree: 1
Node 7 --> Degree: 2
Node 0 --> Degree: 3
Node 6 --> Degree: 3
Node 8 --> Degree: 3
Node 2 --> Degree: 4
Node 5 --> Degree: 5

Now, we examine each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Edge (0, 5): Node 0 is connected to Nodes 5, 7, and 1. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, 8, and 1. They share Node 1. 
Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 is connected to Nodes 5, 7, and 1. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 0, 6, and 6. They share Node 6. 
Triangle: <0, 6, 7>

- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 is connected to Nodes 5, 0, and 2. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, 8, and 1. They share Nodes 0 and 1. 
Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

- Edge (2, 5): Node 2 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, 8, and 1. They share Nodes 2 and 8. 
Triangle: <2, 5, 8>

- Edge (2, 6): Node 2 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 6. They share Node 2. 
Triangle: <2, 6, 9>

- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 5, and 5. They share Node 5. 
Triangle: <2, 5, 8>

- Edge (2, 9): Node 2 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2. They share Node 2.
Triangle: <2, 6, 9>

- Edge (3, 6): Node 3 is connected to Nodes 6. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 6. They share Node 3. 
Triangle: <2, 3, 6>

- Edge (5, 8): Node 5 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, 8, and 1. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 5, and 5. They share Nodes 2 and 5.
Triangle: <2, 5, 8>

- Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 6. Node 7 is connected to Nodes 0, 6, and 6. They share Node 6. 
Triangle: <0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [8]
