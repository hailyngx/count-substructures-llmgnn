Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most gives us the following order: 
Nodes: 7, 8, 0, 1, 6, 3, 5, 4, 9, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we proceed with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking the edges: 
(0, 1): Forms a triangle with node 2. 
(0, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9.
(0, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 3.
(0, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4.
(1, 0): Skipped since node 1 has more connections than node 0.
(1, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4.
(2, 1): Skipped since node 2 has more connections than node 1.
(2, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5.
(2, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9.
(2, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.
(2, 6): Skipped since node 2 has more connections than node 6.
(3, 2): Skipped since node 3 has more connections than node 2.
(3, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.
(3, 6): Skipped since node 3 has more connections than node 6.
(4, 0): Skipped since node 4 has more connections than node 0.
(4, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9.
(4, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.
(5, 0): Skipped since node 5 has more connections than node 0.
(5, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.
(5, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.
(9, 0): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4.
(9, 1): Skipped since node 9 has more connections than node 1.
(9, 3): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 5.
(9, 4): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 2.
(9, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 3.

Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>
