Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be used to count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Vertex 5: 2 connections
   - Vertices 1, 2, 6: 3 connections
   - Vertices 3, 7: 4 connections
   - Vertices 0, 4: 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   - Vertex 5 -> 0
   - Vertices 1, 2 -> 1, 2
   - Vertices 3, 7 -> 3, 4
   - Vertices 0, 4 -> 5, 6

3. Count triangles by considering each edge:
   - (0, 1) forms triangles with (0, 2) and (1, 5) (total: 2 triangles)
   - (0, 2) forms a triangle with (2, 4) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (0, 3) forms triangles with (3, 7) and (5, 6) (total: 2 triangles)
   - (0, 4) forms triangles with (4, 7) and (6, 5) (total: 2 triangles)
   - (0, 6) forms a triangle with (6, 7) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (0, 7) forms a triangle with (4, 1) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (1, 4) forms a triangle with (4, 7) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (1, 5) does not form any triangles
   - (2, 3) forms a triangle with (3, 7) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (2, 4) forms a triangle with (4, 1) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (3, 5) does not form any triangles
   - (3, 7) forms a triangle with (4, 1) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (4, 7) forms a triangle with (6, 5) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (5, 6) forms a triangle with (6, 7) (total: 1 triangle)
   - (6, 7) does not form any triangles

4. Total number of triangles = 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 1>, <3, 4, 1>, <4, 6, 5>, <5, 6, 7>
