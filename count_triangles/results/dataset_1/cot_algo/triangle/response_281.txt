Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 5 is connected to 0 nodes.
- Vertex 2 is connected to 1 node.
- Vertex 8 is connected to 1 node.
- Vertex 4 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Vertex 6 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Vertex 7 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Vertex 9 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Vertex 3 is connected to 5 nodes.
- Vertex 0 is connected to 6 nodes.
- Vertex 1 is connected to 6 nodes.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will explore the edges only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 1): Shared connections: 3, 7, 9. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>.
- For edge (0, 3): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <0, 3, 1>.
- For edge (0, 6): No additional triangle.
- For edge (0, 7): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <0, 7, 1>.
- For edge (1, 3): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <1, 3, 0>.
- For edge (1, 4): No additional triangle.
- For edge (1, 7): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <1, 7, 0>.
- For edge (1, 9): Shared connections: 0, 3. Triangles: <1, 9, 3>, <1, 9, 0>.
- For edge (3, 9): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <3, 9, 1>.
- For edge (3, 4): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <3, 4, 1>.
- For edge (6, 9): No additional triangle.
- For edge (7, 9): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <7, 9, 0>.
