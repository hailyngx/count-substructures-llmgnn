Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph and edges, we will first sort the vertices by their degrees:

Node 2: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection (with node 9)
Node 1: 2 connections (with nodes 7 and 9)
Node 5: 2 connections (with nodes 3 and 9)
Node 6: 2 connections (with nodes 0 and 4)
Node 4: 2 connections (with nodes 3 and 6)
Node 0: 2 connections (with nodes 3 and 6)
Node 7: 2 connections (with nodes 1 and 3)
Node 3: 6 connections (with nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 9)
Node 9: 6 connections (with nodes 1, 3, 5, 8)

We will go through the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has fewer connections than node 3. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 0 and 3: {6}

- Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has fewer connections than node 6. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 0 and 6: {}
  
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 7. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 1 and 7: {}

- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has fewer connections than node 9. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 1 and 9: {}

- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 4. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 3 and 4: {}
  
- Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 5. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 3 and 5: {9}

- Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 7. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 3 and 7: {}

- Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has fewer connections than node 9. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 3 and 9: {5}

- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has fewer connections than node 6. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 4 and 6: {}

- Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has fewer connections than node 9. Check for shared connections.
  Shared connections for nodes 5 and 9: {3}

Based on the shared connections, the triangles formed are:
<0, 3, 6>
<3, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is: [2]
