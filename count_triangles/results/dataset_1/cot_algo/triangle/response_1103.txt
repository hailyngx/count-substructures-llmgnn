Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices by their degree:
   - Node 3: 2 connections
   - Node 2: 2 connections
   - Node 7: 4 connections
   - Node 8: 3 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 1: 5 connections
   - Node 5: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 7 connections
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 8 connections

2. Renumber the nodes accordingly:
   - Node 3 (2 connections) --> Node 0
   - Node 2 (2 connections) --> Node 1
   - Node 7 (4 connections) --> Node 2
   - Node 8 (3 connections) --> Node 3
   - Node 9 (4 connections) --> Node 4
   - Node 1 (5 connections) --> Node 5
   - Node 5 (4 connections) --> Node 6
   - Node 4 (7 connections) --> Node 7
   - Node 0 (4 connections) --> Node 8
   - Node 6 (8 connections) --> Node 9

3. Count the triangles based on the renumbered nodes:
   - Triangles: [<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 7>] 

In total, there are [10] triangles in the given graph.
