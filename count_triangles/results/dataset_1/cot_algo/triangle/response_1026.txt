Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following order: 

Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 1 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 0 (Degree 6)
Node 3 (Degree 7)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Triangles:
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
