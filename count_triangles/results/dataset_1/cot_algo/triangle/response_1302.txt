Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in order from least to most connections: 5, 8, 9, 3, 5, 0, 2, 1, 7, 4, 6

After relabeling the vertices, the edges to be considered are: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (7, 1), (7, 4)

Calculating the triangles formed:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
