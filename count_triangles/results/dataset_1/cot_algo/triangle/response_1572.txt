Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes in increasing order of their degrees:

Node 8: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

1. (0, 2):
   - Node 0 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 6, forming a triangle. (0, 2, 6)

2. (0, 6):
   - Node 0 and Node 6 have a shared connection with Node 1, forming a triangle. (0, 6, 1)

3. (1, 3):
   - Node 1 and Node 3 have a shared connection with Node 5, forming a triangle. (1, 3, 5)

4. (1, 5):
   - Node 1 and Node 5 have a shared connection with Node 2, forming a triangle. (1, 5, 2)

5. (1, 6):
   - Node 1 and Node 6 have a shared connection with Node 0, forming a triangle. (1, 6, 0)

6. (1, 7):
   - Node 1 and Node 7 have shared connections with Nodes 2 and 5, forming two triangles: (1, 7, 2) and (1, 7, 5)

7. (2, 0):
   - Node 2 and Node 0 have a shared connection with Node 6, forming a triangle. (2, 0, 6)

8. (2, 3):
   - Node 2 and Node 3 have a shared connection with Node 5, forming a triangle. (2, 3, 5)

9. (2, 5):
   - Node 2 and Node 5 have shared connections with Nodes 1, 3, and 7, forming three triangles: (2, 5, 1), (2, 5, 3), and (2, 5, 7)

10. (2, 7):
    - Node 2 and Node 7 have shared connections with Nodes 1 and 6, forming two triangles: (2, 7, 1) and (2, 7, 6)

11. (3, 1):
    - Node 3 and Node 1 have a shared connection with Node 5, forming a triangle. (3, 1, 5)

12. (3, 2):
    - Node 3 and Node 2 have a shared connection with Node 5, forming a triangle. (3, 2, 5)

13. (3, 5):
    - Node 3 and Node 5 have shared connections with Node 1, 2, and 7, forming three triangles: (3, 5, 1), (3, 5, 2), and (3, 5, 7)

14. (3, 9):
    - Node 3 and Node 9 have shared connections with Node 4, forming a triangle. (3, 9, 4)

15. (4, 6):
    - Nodes 4 and 6 have shared connections with Nodes 1 and 7, forming two triangles: (4, 6, 1) and (4, 6, 7)

16. (4, 9):
    - Node 4 and Node 9 have a shared connection with Node 3, forming a triangle. (4, 9, 3)

17. (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7):
    - Similar to above results, we get additional triangles: (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 7), (5, 6, 1), (5, 6, 7)

18. (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7):
    - Similar to above results, we get additional triangles: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 2), (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 7), (6, 4, 7)

19. (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6):
    - Similar to above results, we get additional triangles: (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 5), (7, 2, 5), (7, 6, 1), (7, 6, 2), (7, 6, 4)

20. (8, 9):
    - Node 8 and Node 9 have a shared connection, but there are no triangles formed from this edge.

21. (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8):
    - Similar to above results, we get additional triangles: (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 6), (9, 8, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [34].
