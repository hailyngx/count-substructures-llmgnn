Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by number of connections are as follows:
Vertices: 2, 9, 0, 7, 4, 8, 1, 6, 5, 3

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connections are 3
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connections are 0
- Edge (0, 9): Shared connections are 6
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connections are 4
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections are 3
- Edge (1, 7): Shared connections are 1
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections are 7
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connections are 1
- Edge (6, 8): Shared connections are 3
- Edge (6, 9): Shared connections are 0

Calculating the total number of triangles using the shared connections:
Total triangles: [7]
