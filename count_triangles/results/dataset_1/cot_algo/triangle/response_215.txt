Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

Vertices: 2 < 5 < 8 < 9 < 7 < 3 < 1 < 0 < 4 < 6

Now, we can count the triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Triangles: [25]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 8>
