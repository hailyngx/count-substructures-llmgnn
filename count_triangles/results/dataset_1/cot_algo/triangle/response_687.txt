Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 1 and 6: 1 connection
Nodes 3 and 7: 2 connections
Nodes 2 and 9: 3 connections
Nodes 4 and 8: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Nodes 5: 7 connections

After sorting the nodes, we relabel them as follows:
0 -> 0
5 -> 1
6 -> 2
8 -> 3
9 -> 4
1 -> 5
3 -> 6
4 -> 7
2 -> 8

Now, we check for triangles based on the edges provided:
- (0, 5): No triangle
- (0, 6): No triangle
- (0, 8): No triangle
- (0, 9): No triangle
- (1, 3): No triangle
- (1, 4): No triangle
- (2, 4): No triangle
- (2, 8): No triangle
- (3, 1): No triangle
- (3, 8): No triangle
- (4, 1): No triangle
- (4, 2): No triangle
- (4, 5): Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- (4, 8): Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- (4, 9): No triangle
- (5, 0): No triangle
- (5, 4): Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- (6, 0): No triangle
- (8, 0): No triangle
- (8, 2): No triangle
- (8, 3): No triangle
- (8, 4): Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- (8, 9): No triangle
- (9, 0): No triangle
- (9, 4): No triangle
- (9, 8): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>.
