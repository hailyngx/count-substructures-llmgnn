Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:

0: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
8: 5 connections

Now, we'll label the vertices accordingly:

0: 0
2: 1
6: 2
9: 3
7: 4
5: 5
4: 6
3: 7
1: 8
8: 9

Next, we'll go through the edges in the graph:

<0, 2>
<0, 6>
<0, 9>
<2, 4>
<2, 7>
<6, 8>
<4, 5>
<7, 5>
<7, 8>
<3, 1>
<3, 8>
<3, 9>
<1, 4>
<1, 5>
<1, 8>

Now we will find the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices of each edge. 

The triangles found are: 

<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 1>
<7, 5, 8>
<0, 9, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
