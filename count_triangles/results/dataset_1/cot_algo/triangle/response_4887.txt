Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree (number of connections):

Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 1
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 3: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6
Node 4: degree 6

Next, let's relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 1 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 5 (degree 2) -> Node 2
Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 3
Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 4
Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 5
Node 8 (degree 4) -> Node 6
Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 7
Node 2 (degree 6) -> Node 8
Node 4 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Now, let's count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
