Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 6 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 0 has degree 4

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 6 (Degree 2) = A
Node 4 (Degree 2) = B
Node 2 (Degree 2) = C
Node 7 (Degree 3) = D
Node 1 (Degree 3) = E
Node 8 (Degree 3) = F
Node 5 (Degree 4) = G
Node 9 (Degree 4) = H
Node 3 (Degree 4) = I
Node 0 (Degree 4) = J

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

- For edge (A, F), there are 0 triangles since A doesn't share connections with F.
- For edge (A, J), there are 0 triangles since A doesn't share connections with J.
- For edge (B, D), there are 0 triangles since B doesn't share connections with D.
- For edge (C, H), there are 0 triangles since C doesn't share connections with H.
- For edge (D, E), there is 1 triangle: <D, E, I>.
- For edge (D, F), there is 1 triangle: <D, F, J>.
- For edge (E, D), there is 1 triangle: <E, D, I>.
- For edge (E, G), there are 0 triangles since E doesn't share connections with G.
- For edge (G, I), there is 1 triangle: <G, I, F>.
- For edge (G, H), there is 1 triangle: <G, H, F>.
- For edge (I, F), there is 1 triangle: <I, F, J>.
- For edge (J, F), there is 1 triangle: <J, F, D>.

Counting the total number of triangles, we get:
