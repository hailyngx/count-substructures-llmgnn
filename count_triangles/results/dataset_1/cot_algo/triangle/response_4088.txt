Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees in increasing order:
- Node 0 (degree 3) -> Node 0
- Node 2 (degree 3) -> Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 2
- Node 5 (degree 5) -> Node 3
- Node 8 (degree 5) -> Node 4
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 5
- Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 6
- Node 9 (degree 1) -> Node 7
- Node 3 (degree 1) -> Node 8

Now, we will list the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1)

Using the degree-based ordering and considering only cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can identify the triangles:

There are no triangles found in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [0].
