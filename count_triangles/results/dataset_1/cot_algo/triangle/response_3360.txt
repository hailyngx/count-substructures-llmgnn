Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, we have the following order: 

Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges. 

We will start with the edges involving the nodes with lower labels and fewer connections. 

1. Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 3>.
5. Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle <2, 9, 1>.
8. Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle <3, 5, 2>.
10. Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [2].
