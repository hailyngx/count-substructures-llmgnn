Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Nodes 4 and 7 have degree 2
- Nodes 6 and 8 have degree 3
- Nodes 2 and 5 have degree 4
- Nodes 0 and 1 and 9 have degree 5

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we start with the edges involving nodes with the smallest degree (nodes 3, 4, and 7). Since they do not have enough connections, we move on to nodes 6 and 8 next. 

We find the following triangles:
- <6, 8, 9>

Moving on to nodes 2 and 5, we find another triangle:
- <2, 5, 8>

Finally, we consider nodes 0, 1, and 9 to find the remaining triangles:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
