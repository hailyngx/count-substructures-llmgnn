Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels are:

Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  
Node 2: 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 1>, <4, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 4>
