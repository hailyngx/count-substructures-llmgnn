Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
By applying Degree-Based Ordering method and sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel the vertices as follows:
Vertices: 3, 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 0, 4, 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1):
   Shared connections: None

2. Edge (0, 2):
   Shared connections: None

3. Edge (0, 3):
   Shared connections: None

4. Edge (0, 4):
   Shared connections: 9
   Triangle: <0, 4, 9>

5. Edge (0, 9):
   Shared connections: None

6. Edge (1, 2):
   Shared connections: None

7. Edge (1, 4):
   Shared connections: None

8. Edge (2, 8):
   Shared connections: None

9. Edge (3, 9):
   Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 9>
