Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves the following steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   - Node 6: Degree 1
   - Nodes 4, 9, 3: Degree 2
   - Nodes 0, 6: Degree 3
   - Nodes 1, 5: Degree 4
   - Nodes 2, 8: Degree 5
   - Node 7: Degree 6

2. Relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
   - Node 6: Label 1
   - Nodes 4, 9, 3: Label 2
   - Nodes 0, 6: Label 3
   - Nodes 1, 5: Label 4
   - Nodes 2, 8: Label 5
   - Node 7: Label 6

3. Check each edge based on the vertices' labels and count triangles:
   - <0, 5, 7> is a triangle.
   - <1, 7, 8> is a triangle.
   - <1, 7, 9> is a triangle.
   - <1, 2, 7> is a triangle.
   - <2, 1, 7> is a triangle.
   - <2, 7, 8> is a triangle.
   - <7, 4, 8> is a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <7, 4, 8>.
