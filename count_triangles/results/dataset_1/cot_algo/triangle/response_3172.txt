Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, from least to most connections. 

The degrees of the vertices are as follows:  
0: 3 connections  
2: 2 connections  
5: 2 connections  
7: 1 connection  
9: 3 connections  
4: 3 connections  
6: 3 connections  
8: 5 connections  
3: 5 connections  

Based on the degree-based ordering, the vertices will be relabeled as follows:  
0 -> 7  
2 -> 1  
5 -> 2  
7 -> 3  
9 -> 4  
4 -> 5  
6 -> 6  
8 -> 8  
3 -> 9  

Now, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(2, 3) (2, 9) (4, 5) (7, 3) (9, 8)

Now, we will check for shared connections to find the triangles:
- Triangle involving vertices 2, 3, and 9: <2, 3, 9>
- Triangle involving vertices 4, 5, and 8: <4, 5, 8>

Count of triangles: [2]
