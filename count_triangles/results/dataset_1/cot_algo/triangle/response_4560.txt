Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Degrees: 2, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2

Now, we relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

Vertices: 3, 0, 6, 7, 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9

Next, we examine each edge following the rule of proceeding only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles formed by shared connections between the vertices, we find the following unique triangles:
<1, 4, 8> and <5, 6, 7>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
