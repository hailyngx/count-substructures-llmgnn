Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

(0, 2): Both have 2 connections, no triangle.
(0, 5): 0 shares connections with 9 and 7 shares connections with 8, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
(0, 7): No triangle formed.
(0, 9): No triangle formed.
(1, 4): Both have 2 connections, no triangle.
(2, 0): No triangle formed.
(3, 5): 3 shares connections with 9 and 5 shares connections with 0, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
(3, 9): 3 shares connections with 5, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
(4, 1): No triangle formed.
(5, 0): No triangle formed.
(5, 3): 5 shares connections with 0 and 3 shares connections with 9, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
(5, 6): No triangle formed.
(5, 8): No triangle formed.
(5, 9): 5 shares connections with 0 and 9 shares connections with 3 and 6, forming two triangles: <0, 5, 9> and <3, 5, 9>.
(6, 5): 6 shares connections with 9, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
(6, 9): 6 shares connections with 5, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
(7, 0): No triangle formed.
(7, 8): No triangle formed.
(7, 9): 7 shares connections with 0 and 9 shares connections with 5, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
(8, 5): No triangle formed.
(8, 7): No triangle formed.
(9, 0): No triangle formed.
(9, 3): 9 shares connections with 5, forming a triangle: <3, 5, 9>.
(9, 5): 9 shares connections with 0, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 7>.
(9, 6): 9 shares connections with 5, forming one more triangle: <0, 5, 7>.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 9>
