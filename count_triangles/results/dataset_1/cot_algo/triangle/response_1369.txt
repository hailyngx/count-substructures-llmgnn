Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels will be:
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 2

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now check each edge for shared connections and count the triangles:

Triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 3>
