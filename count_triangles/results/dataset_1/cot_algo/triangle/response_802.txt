Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are as follows:
Node 7 with 2 connections, Node 0 with 2 connections, Node 1 with 3 connections, Node 3 with 3 connections, Node 6 with 3 connections, Node 4 with 4 connections, Node 2 with 5 connections, Node 5 with 5 connections, Node 8 with 5 connections, and Node 9 with 5 connections.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are as follows:
[8 triangles] 
<1, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <5, 9, 7>
