Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices sorted by their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- Starting with vertices with the least connections, we focus on nodes 0, 9, 3, 5, 8.
- Nodes 0, 3, and 4 form a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
- Nodes 1, 2, and 7 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Nodes 1, 5, and 6 form a triangle <1, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
