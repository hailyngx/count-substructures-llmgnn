Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 4
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 3
Node 9 - degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 
Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Found triangle(s):
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
