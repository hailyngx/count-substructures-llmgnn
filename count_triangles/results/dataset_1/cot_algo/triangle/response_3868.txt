Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the degree-based ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted vertices based on their degrees are:
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex:

Considering vertices 7 and 3:
- No triangles formed between vertices 7 and 3.

Considering vertices 9 and 3:
- No triangles formed between vertices 9 and 3.

Considering vertices 2 and 0:
- Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.

Considering vertices 6 and 0:
- No triangles formed between vertices 6 and 0.

Considering vertices 8 and 4:
- Triangle formed: <4, 5, 8>.

Considering vertices 3 and 7:
- No triangles formed between vertices 3 and 7.

Considering vertices 5 and 1:
- Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.

Considering vertices 1 and 6:
- Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, and <1, 4, 5>.
