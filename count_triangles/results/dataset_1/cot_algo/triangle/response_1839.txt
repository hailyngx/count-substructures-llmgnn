Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows: 
Vertices: 3, 0, 4, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 1, 2

With this new labeling, we can count the triangles:

1. Triangles involving vertex 3:
   - <0, 2, 3>

2. Triangles involving vertex 0:
   - <2, 0, 3>
   - <2, 0, 5>
   - <0, 1, 6>

3. Triangles involving vertex 4:
   - <1, 4, 6>

4. Triangles involving vertex 7:
   - None

5. Triangles involving vertex 8:
   - None

6. Triangles involving vertex 5:
   - <2, 5, 7>

7. Triangles involving vertex 9:
   - None

8. Triangles involving vertex 6:
   - <1, 6, 4>
   - <2, 6, 4>
   - <1, 6, 9>
   - <2, 6, 9>

9. Triangles involving vertex 1:
   - <6, 1, 4>
   - <6, 1, 9>

10. Triangles involving vertex 2:
   - <6, 2, 4>
   - <6, 2, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13].
