Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will label the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order. 

Vertices: 
0 (Degree: 1)
2 (Degree: 0)
4 (Degree: 0)
8 (Degree: 1)
4 (Degree: 1)
1 (Degree: 3)
7 (Degree: 3)
3 (Degree: 4)
6 (Degree: 4)
5 (Degree: 4)

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified, only counting triangles where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Triangles:
<1, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
