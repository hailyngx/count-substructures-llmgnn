Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 -> 0 connections
Node 6 -> 1 connection
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 8 -> 3 connections
Node 0 -> 4 connections
Node 7 -> 4 connections
Node 4 -> 5 connections
Node 9 -> 5 connections
Node 2 -> 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (0, 1):
   Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 shared connections: 8, 2, 4, 9
   This forms a triangle: <0, 1, 4>

2. For edge (0, 2):
   Node 0 and Node 2 have 3 shared connections: 8, 4, 9
   This forms a triangle: <0, 2, 4>

3. For edge (0, 3):
   Node 0 and Node 3 have 1 shared connection: 7
   No triangle formed.

4. For edge (0, 8):
   Node 0 and Node 8 have 1 shared connection: 4
   No triangle formed.

5. For edge (1, 4):
   Node 1 and Node 4 have 2 shared connections: 9, 2
   No triangle formed.

6. For edge (2, 6):
   Node 2 and Node 6 have 1 shared connection: 7
   No triangle formed.

7. For edge (3, 7):
   Node 3 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection: 4
   No triangle formed.

8. For edge (4, 7):
   Node 4 and Node 7 have 3 shared connections: 1, 2, 9
   This forms a triangle: <1, 4, 7>

9. For edge (8, 9):
   Node 8 and Node 9 have 2 shared connections: 4, 9
   No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4> <0, 2, 4> <1, 4, 7>
