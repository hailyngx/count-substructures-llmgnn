Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their number of connections:

Nodes in order of connections: 8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 9, 0, 4

After sorting, the edges are processed by checking if the lower label vertex has fewer connections:

Triangles formed: 
<0, 4, 9>
