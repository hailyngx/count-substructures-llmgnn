Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 6
Vertex 7: Degree 6

Since we have 10 nodes, we will now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by identifying unique triangles through shared connections.

There are [21] triangles in the given graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
