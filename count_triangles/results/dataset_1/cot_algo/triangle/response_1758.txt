Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order: 
Nodes with their respective connections: 
0: 1 
4: 0 
7: 1 
8: 1 
$(2, 4)$ $(0, 5)$ $(7, 4)$ $(7, 8)$ $(0, 2) (2, 5)$ $(4, 2) (0, 4)$ 
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 5>.
