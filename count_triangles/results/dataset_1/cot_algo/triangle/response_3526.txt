Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertices with their connections:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 0 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
6: 3 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections

Vertices sorted for labeling:
2, 4, 5, 3, 8, 0, 9, 6, 1, 7

Now, reassign labels to the vertices:
2: 0
4: 1
5: 2
3: 3
8: 4
0: 5
9: 6
6: 7
1: 8
7: 9

Now, we check for triangles based on the sorted labels:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>

Output: [6]
