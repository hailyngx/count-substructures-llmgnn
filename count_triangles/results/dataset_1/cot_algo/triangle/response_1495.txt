Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:

- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 6 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections:

- Vertex 0 (1 connection) becomes Vertex A
- Vertex 6 (1 connection) becomes Vertex B
- Vertex 8 (1 connection) becomes Vertex C
- Vertex 2 (2 connections) becomes Vertex D
- Vertex 4 (3 connections) becomes Vertex E
- Vertex 5 (3 connections) becomes Vertex F
- Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex G
- Vertex 9 (3 connections) becomes Vertex H
- Vertex 7 (4 connections) becomes Vertex I
- Vertex 3 (6 connections) becomes Vertex J

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Consider edge (0, 3): Vertex A (0) and Vertex J (3) share no connections.
- Consider edge (1, 3): Vertex G (1) and Vertex J (3) share no connections.
- Consider edge (1, 7): Vertex G (1) and Vertex I (7) share no connections.
- Consider edge (1, 9): Vertex G (1) and Vertex H (9) share no connections.
- Consider edge (2, 4): Vertex D (2) and Vertex E (4) share no connections.
- Consider edge (2, 5): Vertex D (2) and Vertex F (5) share no connections.
- Consider edge (2, 9): Vertex D (2) and Vertex H (9) share no connections.
- Consider edge (3, 4): Vertex J (3) and Vertex E (4) share 1 connection with Vertex D (2), forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Consider edge (3, 5): Vertex J (3) and Vertex F (5) share no connections.
- Consider edge (3, 7): Vertex J (3) and Vertex I (7) share no connections.
- Consider edge (3, 8): Vertex J (3) and Vertex C (8) share no connections.
- Consider edge (4, 9): Vertex E (4) and Vertex H (9) share no connections.
- Consider edge (5, 7): Vertex F (5) and Vertex I (7) share no connections.
- Consider edge (7, 6): Vertex I (7) and Vertex B (6) share no connections.

The total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangles found are <2, 3, 4>.
