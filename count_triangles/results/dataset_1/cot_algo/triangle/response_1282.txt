Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we obtain the following order: 

Node 5: degree 1
Node 1: degree 0
Node 2: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 3: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 6

Now, we will check each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 0 and 8: <0, 2, 8>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 0 and 9: <0, 8, 9>
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 6: <3, 9, 6>
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] (triangles <0, 2, 8>, <0, 8, 9>, and <3, 9, 6>).
