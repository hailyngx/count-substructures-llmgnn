Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method with vertices labelled accordingly, the sorted vertices are: 
Vertices with connections [0]: 7, 8, 9 
Vertices with connections [1]: 5, 6 
Vertices with connections [2]: 2, 3 
Vertices with connections [3]: 1 
Vertices with connections [4]: 0, 4 

Using the given edges and starting from the vertex with the smallest degree, the triangles found are: 
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 0>
<7, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 0, 2>
<4, 0, 3>
<4, 2, 3>
<5, 1, 0>
<6, 5, 3>
<9, 5, 1>
<9, 5, 3>
<8, 4, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [15].
