Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new node labels are as follows:  
Node 0 has degree 3  
Node 1 has degree 5  
Node 2 has degree 2  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 5  
Node 6 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 8 has degree 5  
Node 9 has degree 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.  

There are a total of [10] triangles in the graph.  

The unique triangles found are:  
<1, 8, 9>  
<1, 5, 9>  
<1, 5, 8>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 1>  
<3, 8, 9>  
<3, 2, 5>  
<3, 2, 9>
