Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The sorted list of nodes based on their degree is as follows: 7, 4, 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 3, 8, 1.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

- Starting with edge (0, 1): Node 0 has 3 connections and node 1 has 6 connections. Since 0 < 1 and 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 0 and 1: 1, 6
  - Triangle found: <0, 1, 6>

- Moving on to edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 3 connections and node 2 has 4 connections. Since 0 < 2 and 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 0 and 2: None

- Next, edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 3 connections and node 6 has 4 connections. Since 0 < 6 and 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 0 and 6: 1, 3
  - Triangle found: <0, 6, 1>

- Skipping the remaining edges involving node 0 as the other nodes have more connections.

Now, looking at the other nodes:
- Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has 4 connections and node 3 has 4 connections. Since 2 < 3 and 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 2 and 3: 1, 8
  - Triangle found: <2, 3, 1>

- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has 4 connections and node 8 has 5 connections. Since 2 < 8 and 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 2 and 8: 1, 9
  - Triangle found: <2, 8, 1>

- Edge (2, 9): Node 2 has 4 connections and node 9 has 4 connections. Since 2 < 9 and 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between 2 and 9: 1, 8
  - Triangle found: <2, 9, 1>

- Proceeding in the same manner for the remaining edges, we have the following triangles: <3, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 1>, <3, 8, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
