Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 - degree 2
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 4 - degree 3
Node 9 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 4

Based on the given edges and the new labels, we have the following triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
