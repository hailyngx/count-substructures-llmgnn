Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the degrees, the vertices are reordered as follows:
Nodes: 4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 1

Now, when we examine each edge while ensuring that the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we can count the triangles by looking for shared connections:

1. Edge (0, 5): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (1, 9): Forms triangle with node 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
8. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (3, 2): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
14. Edge (5, 2): Forms triangle with node 0. Triangle: <0, 2, 5>
15. Edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (7, 9): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
20. Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (9, 1): Forms triangle with node 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 9>
23. Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
24. Edge (9, 7): Forms triangle with node 1. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, and <1, 7, 9>.
