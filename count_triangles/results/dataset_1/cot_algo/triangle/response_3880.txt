Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Upon sorting the vertices by their degree, the labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Node 0 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 6 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 5 connections
Node 2 - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges based on the labels of the nodes involved.
