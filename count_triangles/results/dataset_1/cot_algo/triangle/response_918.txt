Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
- Node 0 connects to nodes 5.
- Node 1 connects to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 2 connects to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 3 connects to nodes 2, 8.
- Node 4 connects to nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 5 connects to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 6 connects to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9.
- Node 7 connects to nodes 2, 4, 8.
- Node 8 connects to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 9 connects to nodes 1, 6, 8.

Considering the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 4, 5>.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 8: <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 8>.
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9: <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 9>.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 8: <1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 8>.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
