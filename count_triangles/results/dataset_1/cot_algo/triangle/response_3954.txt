Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degrees of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 1) is relabeled as 0
- Node 2 (degree 1) is relabeled as 1
- Node 3 (degree 1) is relabeled as 2
- Node 9 (degree 1) is relabeled as 3
- Node 0 (degree 2) is relabeled as 4
- Node 5 (degree 2) is relabeled as 5
- Node 7 (degree 2) is relabeled as 6
- Node 6 (degree 4) is relabeled as 7
- Node 8 (degree 4) is relabeled as 8

Next, we will list the edges in the order of the vertices with lower labels having fewer connections:
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 9), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (5, 6), (7, 8), (6, 8), (8, 9)

Now, we will find the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 2: <2, 6, 8>

Counting the triangles, we get a total of [2] triangles.
