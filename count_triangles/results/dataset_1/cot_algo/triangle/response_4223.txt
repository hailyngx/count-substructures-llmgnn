Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their degrees: 
Node 3 -> degree 0
Node 4 -> degree 3
Node 5 -> degree 2
Node 6 -> degree 2
Node 7 -> degree 4
Node 8 -> degree 2
Node 9 -> degree 4
Node 0 -> degree 3
Node 1 -> degree 3
Node 2 -> degree 3

Edges to consider: 
(0, 4)
