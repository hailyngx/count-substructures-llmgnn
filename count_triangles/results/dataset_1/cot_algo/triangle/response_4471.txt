Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method sorts the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted vertices are: 

0 - 2 connections  
1 - 1 connection  
4 - 3 connections  
6 - 1 connection  
9 - 2 connections  
5 - 3 connections  
7 - 4 connections  
3 - 4 connections  
8 - 4 connections  
2 - 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we iterate through the edges: 
1. (1, 3) - Proceed as 1 has fewer connections than 3, but there are no triangles.  
2. (3, 1) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
3. (6, 9) - Proceed as 6 has fewer connections than 9, but there are no triangles.  
4. (9, 0) - Proceed as 9 has fewer connections than 0, but there are no triangles.  
5. (0, 8) - Proceed as 0 has fewer connections than 8. We find the triangle <0, 2, 8>.  
6. (8, 0) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
7. (0, 9) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
8. (2, 7) - Proceed as 2 has fewer connections than 7, but there are no triangles.  
9. (7, 5) - Proceed as 7 has fewer connections than 5. We find the triangle <2, 5, 7>.  
10. (5, 4) - Proceed as 5 has fewer connections than 4. We find the triangle <2, 4, 5>.  
11. (4, 2) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
12. (2, 3) - Proceed as 2 has fewer connections than 3, but there are no triangles.  
13. (3, 7) - Proceed as 3 has fewer connections than 7. We find the triangle <2, 3, 7>.  
14. (7, 2) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
15. (2, 5) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
16. (5, 7) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
17. (7, 3) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
18. (2, 4) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
19. (4, 5) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
20. (5, 2) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  
21. (2, 8) - Proceed as 2 has fewer connections than 8. We find the triangle <0, 2, 8>.  
22. (8, 4) - Proceed as 8 has fewer connections than 4. We find the triangle <2, 4, 8>.  
23. (4, 8) - We have already considered this edge. Skip.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
