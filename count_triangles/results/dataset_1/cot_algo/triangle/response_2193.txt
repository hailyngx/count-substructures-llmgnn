Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

1. Node 0: 2 connections
2. Node 1: 3 connections
3. Node 4: 2 connections
4. Node 6: 2 connections
5. Node 7: 3 connections
6. Node 9: 2 connections
7. Node 3: 3 connections
8. Node 8: 4 connections
9. Node 2: 4 connections
10. Node 5: 4 connections

Now, we will consider each edge based on the lower labeled node:

- Edge (0, 3): forms triangle <0, 3, 2>.
- Edge (0, 6): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4): forms triangle <1, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 5): forms triangle <1, 5, 2>.
- Edge (1, 7): forms triangle <1, 7, 8>.
- Edge (2, 3): forms triangle <2, 3, 0>.
- Edge (2, 5): forms triangle <2, 5, 1>.
- Edge (2, 8): forms triangle <2, 8, 1>.
- Edge (3, 4): forms triangle <3, 4, 1>.
- Edge (3, 2): forms triangle <3, 2, 5>.
- Edge (3, 5): forms triangle <3, 5, 1>.
- Edge (4, 5): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3): forms triangle <4, 3, 0>.
- Edge (5, 1): forms triangle <5, 1, 4>.
- Edge (5, 2): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8): forms triangle <5, 8, 2>.
- Edge (5, 9): forms triangle <5, 9, 8>.
- Edge (6, 0): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 6): does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8): forms triangle <7, 8, 5>.
- Edge (8, 2): forms triangle <8, 2, 5>.
- Edge (8, 5): forms triangle <8, 5, 1>.
- Edge (8, 7): forms triangle <8, 7, 1>.
- Edge (8, 9): forms triangle <8, 9, 5>.
- Edge (9, 5): forms triangle <9, 5, 1>.

By counting the number of unique triangles, we find that there are a total of [16] triangles in the given graph.
