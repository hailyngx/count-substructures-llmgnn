Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Node 6: 0 connections
   Nodes 3 and 9: 1 connection
   Nodes 5 and 8: 3 connections
   Nodes 1 and 2: 4 connections
   Nodes 4 and 7: 5 connections
   Node 0: 6 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
   Node 6 (0 connections) becomes Node 0
   Nodes 3 and 9 (1 connection each) become Nodes 1 and 2
   Nodes 5 and 8 (3 connections each) become Nodes 3 and 4
   Nodes 1 and 2 (4 connections each) become Nodes 5 and 6
   Nodes 4 and 7 (5 connections each) become Nodes 7 and 8
   Node 0 (6 connections) becomes Node 9

3. Since we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will check for triangles for each edge:
- (0, 1): No triangle
- (0, 2): No triangle
- (0, 8): No triangle
- (0, 9): No triangle
- (1, 3): No triangle
- (1, 4): No triangle
- (1, 5): Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- (3, 5): No triangle
- (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- (4, 5): No triangle
- (4, 6): No triangle
- (4, 7): No triangle
- (5, 1): Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- (5, 3): No triangle
- (5, 7): No triangle
- (7, 4): No triangle
- (7, 5): No triangle
- (7, 8): No triangle
- (7, 9): No triangle
- (8, 7): No triangle
- (9, 7): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 5>
