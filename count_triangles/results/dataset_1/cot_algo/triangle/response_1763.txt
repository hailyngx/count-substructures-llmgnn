Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Nodes 2, 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 4 connections
Nodes 4, 7: 5 connections
Nodes 5, 6, 8: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by checking shared connections between edges:
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connection with Node 6 -> Triangle <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connection with Nodes 4, 8 -> Triangles <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>
- Edge (0, 7): No triangles
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles
- Edge (4, 6): Shared connection with Node 8 -> Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles
- Edge (4, 8): No triangles

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles are <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, and <4, 6, 8>.
