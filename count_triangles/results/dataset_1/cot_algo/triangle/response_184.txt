Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 3: 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
