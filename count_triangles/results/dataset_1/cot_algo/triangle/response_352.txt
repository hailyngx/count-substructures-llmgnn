Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 1 connection
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 3 connections
Node 3 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 1 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking Node 5:
  - Nodes 2 and 5 share Node 4, forming a triangle <2, 4, 5>.

Checking Node 3:
  - Nodes 1 and 3 share Nodes 9 and 1, forming two triangles <1, 3, 9> and <1, 3, 4>.
  - Nodes 4 and 3 share Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 4>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
