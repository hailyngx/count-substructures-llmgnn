Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 1 -> Degree 3
Node 7 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 4
Node 3 -> Degree 5
Node 4 -> Degree 5
Node 9 -> Degree 5
Node 6 -> Degree 6
Node 2 -> Degree 7
Node 5 -> Degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we process the edges in the following order based on the new labeling:
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 9)

By counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>
