Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, we have the following new labels for each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2.
- Node 1 has degree 2.
- Node 3 has degree 2.
- Node 4 has degree 2.
- Node 7 has degree 2.
- Node 9 has degree 3.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 5.
- Node 2 has degree 5.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we find the triangles and count them:

Triangles:
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
