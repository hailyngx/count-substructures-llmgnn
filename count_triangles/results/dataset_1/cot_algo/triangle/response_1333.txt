Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method begins by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Node 3 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Nodes 7 and 9 have 2 connections each
Nodes 1 and 8 have 3 connections each
Nodes 2 and 6 have 4 connections each
Node 4 has 5 connections
Node 0 has 6 connections

Now, we will apply the method to count the triangles.

Starting with the edge list and the sorted vertices:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8)
(1, 9)
(2, 3) (2, 9)
(3, 7)
(4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7)
(5, 8)
(6, 7)
(9, 2)

Here, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Now, by checking for shared connections:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 4, 5>
4. <0, 4, 6>
5. <0, 4, 7>
6. <0, 8, 5>
7. <0, 8, 2>
8. <0, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
