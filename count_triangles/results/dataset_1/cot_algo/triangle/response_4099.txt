Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, then relabeling them accordingly. 

Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding connections:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 8>, 
<1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>,
<2, 3, 6>,
<3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, 
<4, 5, 8>,
<5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 9>, 
<6, 8, 9>, 
<7, 8, 9>
