Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we analyze the edges:
1. (0, 2) - shared connections: None
2. (0, 6) - shared connections: None
3. (1, 3) - shared connections: None
4. (1, 8) - shared connections: None
5. (2, 4) - shared connections: None
6. (3, 5) - shared connections: None
7. (4, 9) - shared connections: None
8. (5, 6) - shared connections: None
9. (6, 7) - shared connections: None
10. (6, 8) - shared connections: None
11. (6, 9) - shared connections: None
12. (7, 9) - shared connections: None
13. (8, 9) - shared connections: None

Based on the shared connections in the graph, we identify the following triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 6, 5>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <4, 9, 6>
- <4, 9, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
