Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:  

0: degree 2  
4: degree 2  
7: degree 2  
1: degree 5  
2: degree 4  
8: degree 4  
3: degree 4  
5: degree 6  
6: degree 6  
9: degree 7  

Next, let's traverse through the edges in the graph, from least to most connected nodes, counting triangles that form.
