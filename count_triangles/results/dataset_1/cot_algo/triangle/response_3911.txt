Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Since Node 4 (degree 4) has a lower degree than Node 0 (degree 6), we will check the shared neighbors of Node 4 (0, 5, 9):
- Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>

Since Node 5 (degree 5) has a lower degree than Node 0 (degree 6), we will check the shared neighbors of Node 5 (1, 3, 4, 7, 8):
- Triangle <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>

The final list of triangles is <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 8>. 
Total number of triangles: [5]
