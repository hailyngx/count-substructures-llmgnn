Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the order becomes: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 0, 6, 4, 7, 2.

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 5) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle <0, 7, 2>.
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle <0, 8, 3>.
- Edge (1, 9) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle <2, 7, 0>.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle <2, 8, 0>.
- Edge (3, 7) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 8) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 2) forms a triangle <4, 2, 9>.
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle <4, 5, 0>.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle <4, 9, 6>.
- Edge (5, 0) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 4) forms a triangle <5, 4, 9>.
- Edge (5, 7) forms a triangle <5, 7, 0>.
- Edge (6, 0) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle <6, 2, 9>.
- Edge (6, 9) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle <7, 0, 2>.
- Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle <7, 2, 0>.
- Edge (7, 3) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle <7, 5, 4>.
- Edge (7, 9) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 0) forms a triangle <8, 0, 2>.
- Edge (8, 2) forms a triangle <8, 2, 0>.
- Edge (8, 3) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 1) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 4) forms a triangle <9, 4, 5>.
- Edge (9, 6) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 7) doesn't form any triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [16].
