Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the nodes by their number of connections:

Nodes by degree: <1, 7, 8, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 2, 5>

Now, we will check the edges in increasing order of degree:

1. Check edge (1, 0): No triangles since node 1 doesn't have any common connections with node 0.
2. Check edge (7, 5): No triangles since node 7 doesn't have any common connections with node 5.
3. Check edge (8, 3): Triangle <3, 8, 0> found.
4. Check edge (0, 1): No triangles since node 0 and node 1 already checked.
5. Check edge (3, 8): Triangle <3, 8, 0> already counted.
6. Check edge (6, 9): No triangles since node 6 doesn't have any common connections with node 9.
7. Check edge (9, 5): No triangles since node 9 doesn't have any common connections with node 5.
8. Check edge (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 0> found.
9. Check edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 0> found.
10. Check edge (5, 7): No triangles since node 5 and node 7 already checked.
11. Check edge (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 3> found.
12. Check edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 0> already counted.
13. Check edge (4, 5): Triangle <4, 5, 0> found.
14. Check edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 0> found.
15. Check edge (5, 9): Triangle <5, 9, 0> found.

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<3, 8, 0>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 3, 0>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 6, 0>
