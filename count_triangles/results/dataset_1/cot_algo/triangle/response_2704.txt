Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are re-labeled based on their degree in ascending order. The vertices are numbered as follows:

0 -> 2 connections
3 -> 2 connections
6 -> 2 connections
7 -> 2 connections
9 -> 3 connections
1 -> 6 connections
8 -> 6 connections
4 -> 7 connections
2 -> 8 connections
5 -> 8 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge and looking for shared connections between the vertices:

- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 5, 6> is found.
- Edge (0, 6): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.
- Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 4. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.

- Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <3, 4, 8> is found.
- Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <2, 3, 5> is found.
- Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 4. Triangle <3, 4, 8> is found.
- Edge (4, 1): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <4, 1, 7> is found.
- Edge (4, 3): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <3, 4, 8> is found.
- Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 9. Triangle <4, 6, 9> is found.
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.
- Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 6. Triangle <4, 6, 9> is found.
- Edge (5, 0): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 5, 6> is found.
- Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (5, 2): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 1. Triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (5, 3): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 2. Triangle <2, 3, 5> is found.
- Edge (6, 0): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 9. Triangle <4, 6, 9> is found.
- Edge (6, 9): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 4. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.
- Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle <1, 4, 7> is found.
- Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle with 3 shared connections with vertices 4 and 9. Triangle <1, 4, 9> is found.
- Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 1. Triangle <1, 2, 8> is found.
- Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with 1 shared connection with vertex 4. Triangle <3, 4, 8> is found.
- Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 1. Triangle <1, 8, 9> is found.
- Edge (9, 1): Forms a triangle with 3 shared connections with vertices 4 and 8. Triangle <1, 4, 8> is found.
- Edge (9, 4): Forms a triangle with 2 shared connections with vertex 6. Triangle <4, 6, 9> is found.
- Edge (9, 6): Does not form a triangle.

After examining all edges, we have found the following unique triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
