Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the updated labels for the vertices are:  
0 - degree 1  
4 - degree 0  
8 - degree 0  
2 - degree 2  
7 - degree 3  
3 - degree 3  
5 - degree 4  
1 - degree 5  
6 - degree 7  
9 - degree 4  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  
Based on the given edges, we find the following triangles:  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
