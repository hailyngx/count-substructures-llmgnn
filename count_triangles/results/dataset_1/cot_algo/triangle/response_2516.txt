Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the relabeled graph would be:
- Node 1 has 0 connection(s)
- Node 7 has 1 connection(s)
- Node 2 has 2 connection(s)
- Node 6 has 2 connection(s)
- Node 4 has 3 connection(s)
- Node 5 has 4 connection(s)
- Node 3 has 4 connection(s)
- Node 8 has 4 connection(s)
- Node 0 has 6 connection(s)
- Node 9 has 6 connection(s)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge to count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 do not share any connections, so no triangles.
- Edge (1, 5): Node 1 and Node 5 do not share any connections, so no triangles.
- Edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <2, 5, 9>.
- Edge (3, 0): Node 3 and Node 0 share connections with Node 5 and Node 9, forming two triangles <0, 3, 5> and <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <4, 5, 9>.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 do not share any connections, so no triangles.
- Edge (7, 0): Node 7 and Node 0 do not share any connections, so no triangles.
- Edge (7, 8): Node 7 and Node 8 do not share any connections, so no triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
