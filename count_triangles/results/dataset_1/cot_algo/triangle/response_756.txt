Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 
Node 5 - degree 1
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 - degree 2
Nodes 0, 7, 8 - degree 6

Considering edges only where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will find the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is: [4]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 9, 5>
