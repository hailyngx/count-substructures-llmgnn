Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree of connectivity, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 8

Now, we will count the triangles formed by each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections. 

The total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are as follows:
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
