Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 5 (Degree: 1)
- Node 1 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 3 (Degree: 3)
- Node 4 (Degree: 3)
- Node 0 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6 (Degree: 5)
- Node 9 (Degree: 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle <0, 6, 2>.
4. Edge (0, 9): Forms a triangle <0, 9, 6>.
5. Edge (1, 2): Not considered (node 1 has fewer connections than node 2).
6. Edge (2, 1): Not considered (node 1 has fewer connections than node 2).
7. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle <4, 2, 6>.
8. Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle <6, 2, 0>.
9. Edge (2, 9): Forms a triangle <9, 2, 0>.
10. Edge (3, 0): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 7): Forms a triangle <7, 3, 6>.
12. Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
13. Edge (4, 2): Forms a triangle <4, 2, 6>.
14. Edge (5, 8): Not considered (node 5 has fewer connections than node 8).
15. Edge (5, 9): Not considered (node 5 has fewer connections than node 9).
16. Edge (6, 0): Forms a triangle <0, 6, 4>.
17. Edge (6, 2): Forms a triangle <6, 2, 0>.
18. Edge (6, 7): Forms a triangle <7, 6, 3>.
19. Edge (6, 8): Forms a triangle <8, 6, 9>.
20. Edge (6, 9): Forms a triangle <9, 6, 0>.
21. Edge (7, 3): Forms a triangle <7, 3, 0>.
22. Edge (7, 6): Forms a triangle <7, 6, 3>.
23. Edge (8, 5): Not considered (node 5 has fewer connections than node 8).
24. Edge (8, 6): Forms a triangle <8, 6, 9>.
25. Edge (8, 9): Forms a triangle <9, 8, 6>.
26. Edge (9, 0): Forms a triangle <9, 0, 6>.
27. Edge (9, 2): Forms a triangle <9, 2, 6>.
28. Edge (9, 5): Not considered (node 5 has fewer connections than node 9).
29. Edge (9, 6): Forms a triangle <9, 6, 0>.
30. Edge (9, 8): Forms a triangle <9, 8, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [17].
