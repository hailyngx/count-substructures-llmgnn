Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their degrees we get: 
Node 7 (degree 0)
Node 5 (degree 1)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 1 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 3)
Node 4 (degree 4)
Node 2 (degree 4)
Node 0 (degree 4)
Node 9 (degree 5)

Following the degree-based ordering, we iterate through the edges:
- Edge (0, 1) is ignored because both vertices have degree 4.
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with node 1: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge (1, 2) is ignored because both vertices have degree 4.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 9: <3, 4, 9>.
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 4, 8>.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with node 0: <0, 4, 9>.
- Edge (5, 9) is ignored because both vertices have degree 1.
- Edge (6, 8) is ignored because both vertices have degree 2.
- Edge (8, 9) is ignored because both vertices have degree 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
