Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0: 7 8 
1: 2 4 
2: 1 6 7 8 
3: 5 6 
4: 1 6 
5: 3 7 9 
6: 2 3 4 
7: 0 2 5 8 9 
8: 0 2 7 
9: 5 7 
```

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degree:
```
0: 2 
1: 2 
3: 2 
4: 2 
9: 2 
8: 3 
5: 3 
6: 4 
7: 5 
2: 4 
```

Next, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 6, 7> (sharing connections: 2-6, 2-7, 6-7)
- Triangle <2, 6, 4> (sharing connections: 2-6, 2-4, 4-6)
- Triangle <2, 7, 5> (sharing connections: 2-7, 2-5, 5-7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
