Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are: 3, 5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 6, 7, 9, 0. 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph are:
- <3, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
