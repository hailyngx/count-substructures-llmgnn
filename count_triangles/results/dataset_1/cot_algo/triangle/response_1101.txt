Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are:
2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 6, 7, 0

Based on the given edges, we can count the triangles. 
The total number of triangles [] = 3

Therefore, the unique triangles are listed as:
<0, 1, 5>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
