Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most:
Vertices: 6, 7, 10, 4, 9, 7, 1, 2, 6, 3

Calculating the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
2. Edge (1, 8): No triangles.
3. Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
4. Edge (2, 4): No triangles.
5. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
6. Edge (3, 1): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
7. Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
8. Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
9. Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
10. Edge (4, 2): No triangles.
11. Edge (4, 5): No triangles.
12. Edge (5, 2): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
13. Edge (5, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 5.
14. Edge (5, 4): No triangles.
15. Edge (5, 8): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
16. Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
17. Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
18. Edge (8, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, and 8.
19. Edge (8, 9): No triangles.
20. Edge (9, 8): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 5>
