Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their connection degrees, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 3 [Degree: 2]  
Node 1 [Degree: 2]  
Node 6 [Degree: 2]  
Node 5 [Degree: 3]  
Node 8 [Degree: 3]  
Node 9 [Degree: 4]  
Node 2 [Degree: 5]  
Node 7 [Degree: 5]  
Node 4 [Degree: 6]  
Node 0 [Degree: 6]  
  
Now, we will find the triangles in the graph:  
- For edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (0, 4): Triangle <0, 4, 5>  
- For edge (0, 7): Triangle <0, 7, 2>  
- For edge (1, 0): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (4, 0): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 9>  
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (6, 4): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (7, 8): Triangle <7, 8, 3>  
- For edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.  
- For edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.  
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
