Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices:
Vertex 2 (1 connection) -> Vertex 0
Vertex 0 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1
Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> Vertex 3
Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
Vertex 6 (2 connections) -> Vertex 5
Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> Vertex 6
Vertex 7 (5 connections) -> Vertex 7
Vertex 9 (5 connections) -> Vertex 8
Vertex 1 (3 connections) -> Vertex 9

Now we list the edges using the new labels:
(0, 1) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 7) (0, 4) (4, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 8) (8, 9) (1, 9) (5, 7) (7, 9)

Now we count the triangles:
From the sorted list of edges, we find the triangles: <1, 3, 4>, <4, 7, 9>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
