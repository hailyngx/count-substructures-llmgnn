Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertices in ascending order of connections: 1, 6, 7, 0, 3, 4, 8, 5, 9, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
1 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 2
0 -> 3
3 -> 4
4 -> 5
8 -> 6
5 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Next, we will check for triangles:
Checking edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(3, 5) shares connection 9
(3, 8) shares connection 2
(3, 9) shares connection 0, 2, 4
(5, 8) shares connection 7
(5, 9) shares connection 0
(7, 8) shares connection 4
(0, 9) shares connection 2
(2, 9) shares connection 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
The unique triangles found are <3, 5, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 0>, <0, 9, 2>, <0, 9, 4>, <2, 9, 3>.
