Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new labeling will be: 
Nodes: 5, 8, 9, 7, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2, 6

Edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are: 
(5, 6) (5, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) 

Counting the triangles formed by shared connections, we find:
Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 1>
