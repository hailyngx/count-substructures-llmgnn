Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
1. 1 -> connections: 2
2. 3 -> connections: 2
3. 8 -> connections: 2
4. 9 -> connections: 2
5. 0 -> connections: 3
6. 7 -> connections: 3
7. 5 -> connections: 4
8. 6 -> connections: 4
9. 2 -> connections: 5
10. 4 -> connections: 5

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering the edges in the order given:

1. Edge between 1 and 4: (1, 4) -> No triangles.
2. Edge between 3 and 5: (3, 5) -> No triangles.
3. Edge between 8 and 9: (8, 9) -> No triangles.
4. Edge between 9 and 7: (9, 7) -> No triangles.
5. Edge between 0 and 6: (0, 6) -> Triangle: <0, 2, 6>.
6. Edge between 7 and 1: (7, 1) -> No triangles.
7. Edge between 8 and 0: (8, 0) -> No triangles.
8. Edge between 5 and 7: (5, 7) -> No triangles.
9. Edge between 6 and 3: (6, 3) -> Triangle: <2, 3, 6>.
10. Edge between 9 and 4: (9, 4) -> Triangle: <2, 4, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>.
