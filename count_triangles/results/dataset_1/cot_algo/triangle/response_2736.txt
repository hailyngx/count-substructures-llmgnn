Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): Node 1 has 2 connections which is less than Node 0's 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (0, 7): Node 7 has 5 connections which is more than Node 0's 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 0's 4 connections. Triangle <0, 2, 8> is formed.
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has 2 connections which is less than Node 7's 5 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 4 has 3 connections which is less than Node 2's 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 3 connections which is less than Node 2's 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (2, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 2's 3 connections. Triangle <2, 0, 8> is formed.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 6 has 2 connections which is less than Node 4's 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (5, 7): Node 5 has 3 connections which is less than Node 7's 5 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (5, 8): Node 8 has 3 connections which is less than Node 5's 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
- Edge (7, 9): Node 9 has 2 connections which is less than Node 7's 5 connections. No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <2, 0, 8>.
