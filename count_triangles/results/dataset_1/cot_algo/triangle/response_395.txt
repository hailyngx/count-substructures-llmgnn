Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:  
0 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 2)  
8 (degree 3)  
6 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 4)  
4 (degree 5)  
7 (degree 5)  
1 (degree 7)  
3 (degree 7)  

Identifying triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, resulting in the triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 8) does not result in any triangle as vertex 8 has a higher degree than vertex 0.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7, resulting in the triangle <1, 7, 2>.
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9, resulting in the triangle <1, 9, 2>.
- Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7, resulting in the triangle <2, 7, 1>.
- Edge (3, 6) does not result in any triangle as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 8) does not result in any triangle as vertex 8 has a higher degree than vertex 3.
- Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, resulting in the triangle <4, 1, 3>.
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9, resulting in the triangle <4, 9, 1>.
- Edge (5, 6) does not result in any triangle as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7, resulting in the triangle <6, 7, 1>.
- Edge (6, 8) does not result in any triangle as both vertices have the same degree.
- Edge (7, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 9, resulting in the triangle <7, 9, 1>.

The total number of triangles is [6].
