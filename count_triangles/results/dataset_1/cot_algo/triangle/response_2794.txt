Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degree:

Node 6: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Node 6: 0
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 4: 3
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 6
Node 5: 7
Node 7: 8
Node 0: 9

Now, let's check for triangles based on the given edges:

- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 7>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Counting the total number of triangles inside brackets [], we find that there are [8] triangles in the given graph.
