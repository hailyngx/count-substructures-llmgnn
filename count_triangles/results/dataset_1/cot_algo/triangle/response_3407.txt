Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 (Degree 1)  
Node 7 (Degree 1)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 8 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 4 (Degree 6)  
Node 9 (Degree 6)  
Node 3 (Degree 6)  
Node 2 (Degree 6)  
Node 1 (Degree 7)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle <2, 4, 1>.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle <3, 4, 1>.
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 2) forms a triangle <4, 2, 1>.
- Edge (4, 3) forms a triangle <4, 3, 1>.
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <2, 4, 1>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 2, 1>
