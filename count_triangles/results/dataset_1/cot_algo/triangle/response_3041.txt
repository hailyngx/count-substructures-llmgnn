Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first re-label the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Vertex 5 has 1 connection  
Vertex 8 has 1 connection  
Vertices 1, 6, 8 have 2 connections  
Vertices 2, 5, 7 have 3 connections  
Vertices 3, 9, 4 have 4 connections  
Vertex 0 has 6 connections  

Now, we will count the number of triangles by considering edges where the vertex with the lesser label has fewer connections. 

For this given graph, the total number of triangles is: [10]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>
