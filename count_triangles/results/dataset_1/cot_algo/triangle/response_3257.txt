Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (1 connection)
3 (1 connection)
7 (1 connection)
2 (2 connections)
6 (2 connections)
5 (0 connections)
1 (3 connections)
4 (3 connections)
8 (5 connections)
9 (6 connections)

Triangles found:
