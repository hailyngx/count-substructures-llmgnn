Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling the nodes accordingly. Here are the nodes sorted by degree:

Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Nodes 4, 9: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 2: 3 connections
Nodes 3, 6: 4 connections
Nodes 0, 5: 5 connections

Now, let's count the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle with nodes 0, 2, 5:
   - Shared connections: 3 (node 0), 1 (node 2), 2 (node 5)
   
2. Triangle with nodes 0, 3, 6:
   - Shared connections: 3 (node 0), 1 (node 3), 1 (node 6)

3. Triangle with nodes 0, 5, 6:
   - Shared connections: 5 (node 0), 2 (node 5), 1 (node 6)

4. Triangle with nodes 0, 5, 9:
   - Shared connections: 5 (node 0), 2 (node 5), 3 (node 9)

5. Triangle with nodes 1, 5, 9:
   - Shared connections: 1 (node 1), 2 (node 5), 3 (node 9)

6. Triangle with nodes 3, 5, 9:
   - Shared connections: 5 (node 3), 2 (node 5), 3 (node 9)

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6], and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 9>.
