Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices in order of degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 0 connections
2: 5 connections
3: 4 connections
4: 1 connection
5: 3 connections
6: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the vertices as follows:
0 → 1 connections → Vertex 0
4 → 1 connection → Vertex 1
8 → 2 connections → Vertex 2
5 → 3 connections → Vertex 3
3 → 4 connections → Vertex 4
6 → 4 connections → Vertex 5
7 → 4 connections → Vertex 6
9 → 4 connections → Vertex 7
2 → 5 connections → Vertex 8

Next, we will check for triangles:
1. Edge (0, 9): Check for shared connections.
2. Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>.
3. Edge (2, 4): Proceed to next edge as node 4 has fewer connections than node 2.
4. Edge (2, 6): Proceed to next edge as node 6 has fewer connections than node 2.
5. Edge (2, 8): Proceed to next edge as node 8 has fewer connections than node 2.
6. Edge (3, 2): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>.
8. Edge (3, 9): Proceed to next edge as node 9 has fewer connections than node 3.
9. Edge (4, 2): Proceed to next edge as node 4 has fewer connections than node 2.
10. Edge (5, 6): Proceed to next edge as node 6 has fewer connections than node 5.
11. Edge (5, 7): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.
12. Edge (6, 2): Proceed to next edge as node 2 has fewer connections than node 6.
13. Edge (6, 5): Proceed to next edge as node 5 has fewer connections than node 6.
14. Edge (6, 7): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.
15. Edge (6, 8): Proceed to next edge as node 8 has fewer connections than node 6.
16. Edge (7, 3): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>.
17. Edge (7, 5): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.
18. Edge (7, 6): Check for shared connections. Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>.
19. Edge (7, 9): Proceed to next edge as node 9 has fewer connections than node 7.
20. Edge (8, 2): Proceed to next edge as node 8 has fewer connections than node 2.
21. Edge (8, 6): Proceed to next edge as node 8 has fewer connections than node 6.
22. Edge (9, 0): Check for shared connections.
23. Edge (9, 3): Proceed to next edge as node 3 has fewer connections than node 9.
24. Edge (9, 7): Proceed to next edge as node 7 has fewer connections than node 9.
