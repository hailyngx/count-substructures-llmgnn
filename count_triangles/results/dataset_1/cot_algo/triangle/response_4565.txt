Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new node labels are as follows: 
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following:
- Triangle <3, 8, 9>
- Triangle <4, 8, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 3, 8>
- Triangle <4, 0, 8>
- Triangle <7, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <7, 6, 4>
- Triangle <3, 6, 4>
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
