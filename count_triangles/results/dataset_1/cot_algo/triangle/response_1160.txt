Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order: 

Nodes:
0 - degree 2
3 - degree 2
7 - degree 2
9 - degree 2
4 - degree 3
8 - degree 3
5 - degree 3
1 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
2 - degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
0 ⟶ 0
3 ⟶ 1
7 ⟶ 2
9 ⟶ 3
4 ⟶ 4
8 ⟶ 5
5 ⟶ 6
1 ⟶ 7
6 ⟶ 8
2 ⟶ 9

Now, considering the edges in the order specified, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [8]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
