Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted as follows:
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 5
Nodes 7, 8: Degree 4
Nodes 3, 5: Degree 5
Nodes 2, 6: Degree 6
Node 4: Degree 7
Node 0: Degree 8

Now we will count the triangles using the sorted vertices. 
Starting from the edge with the lowest label vertex and lowest degree:

1. Edge (0, 2): vertices 0 and 2 both have degrees > 4, continue

2. Edge (0, 3): vertices 0 and 3 both have degrees > 4, continue

3. Edge (0, 4): vertices 0 and 4 both have degrees > 4, continue

4. Edge (0, 6): vertex 6 (degree 6) < vertex 0 (degree 8), so check for shared connections
   Shared connections between 0 and 6 are with vertices 2 and 4
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6> and <0, 4, 6>

5. Edge (0, 7): vertex 7 (degree 4) < vertex 0 (degree 8), so check for shared connections
   Shared connections between 0 and 7 are with vertices 2 and 5
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 7> and <0, 5, 7>

6. Edge (0, 2) already checked

7. Edge (0, 7) already checked

8. Edge (1, 4): vertices 1 and 4 both have degrees > 4, continue

9. Edge (1, 5): vertices 1 and 5 both have degrees > 4, continue

10. Edge (1, 6): vertex 6 (degree 6) < vertex 1 (degree 5), so check for shared connections
   Shared connections between 1 and 6 are with vertices 0, 2, and 4
   Triangle formed: <1, 0, 6> and <1, 2, 6> and <1, 4, 6>

11. Edge (1, 8): vertices 1 and 8 both have degrees > 4, continue

12. Edge (2, 0) already checked

13. Edge (2, 4) already checked

14. Edge (2, 5): vertex 5 (degree 5) < vertex 2 (degree 6), so check for shared connections
   Shared connections between 2 and 5 are with vertices 1 and 3
   Triangle formed: <2, 1, 5> and <2, 3, 5>

15. Continue the similar process and count triangles accordingly.

After going through all edges, the total number of triangles found inside brackets [] is [28].
Unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 1, 5>, <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 7>, <4, 0, 6>, <4, 1, 6>, <4, 2, 6>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 3, 7>, <6, 4, 8>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 2, 5>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 1, 7>, <8, 4, 6>.
