Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their degrees, from the least connected to the most connected. 

The degrees of the vertices in this graph are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 6
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 0 --> Vertex 7 (degree 1)
- Vertex 1 --> Vertex 8 (degree 1)
- Vertex 2 --> Vertex 0 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 --> Vertex 9 (degree 4)
- Vertex 4 --> Vertex 1 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 --> Vertex 4 (degree 3)
- Vertex 6 --> Vertex 2 (degree 4)
- Vertex 7 --> Vertex 5 (degree 6)
- Vertex 8 --> Vertex 6 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 --> Vertex 3 (degree 3)

Now, let's look at the edges following the degree-based ordering:

- Vertex 7 - Vertex 5 (Shared connections with Vertex 4)
- Vertex 7 - Vertex 6 (Shared connections with Vertex 4)
- Vertex 7 - Vertex 4 (Shared connections with Vertex 5 and Vertex 6)
- Vertex 5 - Vertex 4 (Shared connections with Vertex 7 and Vertex 6)
- Vertex 6 - Vertex 4 (Shared connections with Vertex 7 and Vertex 5)
- Vertex 6 - Vertex 2 (Shared connections with Vertex 0)
- Vertex 6 - Vertex 0 (Shared connections with Vertex 2)

Therefore, there are a total of 7 triangles in the given graph. 

The triangles are:
<7, 5, 4>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 5>, <5, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 5>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 0, 2>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
