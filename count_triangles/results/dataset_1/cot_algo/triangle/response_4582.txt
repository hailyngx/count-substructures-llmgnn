Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph after the degree-based ordering would have the following vertices ordering: 2, 8, 1, 3, 4, 9, 5, 6, 7, 0.

By following the degree-based ordering and the shared connections between the vertices, we find the following triangles: 
<4, 5, 7> 
<4, 5, 6> 
<4, 6, 7> 
<5, 6, 7> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
