Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, we get the following numbering: 

Vertices: [2, 8, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7, 1, 0]

Using this numbering, the edges that meet the condition where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections are: 
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 9)

Counting the triangles formed by these edges, we find:
[13]

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 9>
