Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then labeling them in that order. The connections for each vertex are as follows:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

The vertices in increasing order of connections are: 1, 5, 9, 3, 2, 6, 7, 0, 4, 8.

Now we look at the edges and identify the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle <0, 3, 1>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle <0, 8, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle <2, 4, 6>.
8. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 0): Forms a triangle <3, 0 ,7>.
11. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 2): Forms a triangle <4, 2, 6>.
13. Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
14. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (5, 0): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle <6, 4, 8>.
20. Edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (7, 9): Forms a triangle <7, 9, 4>.
24. Edge (8, 0): Forms a triangle <8, 0, 3>.
25. Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
27. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (9, 7): Forms a triangle <9, 7, 0>.

The total number of triangles identified is 8, and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <0, 8, 4>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <7, 9, 4>, <8, 0, 3>, and <9, 7, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
