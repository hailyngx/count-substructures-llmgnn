Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new numbering of the vertices is as follows:
```
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge to count the triangles formed. We only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
