Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

By sorting the nodes according to their connections from least to most, we get:
- Node 4: 0 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 0: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method by considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 2: <0, 1, 2>
2. (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
3. (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
4. (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
5. (1, 2) does not form a triangle.
6. (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
7. (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
8. (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
9. (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
10. (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
11. (2, 8) forms a triangle with node 6: <2, 6, 8>.
12. (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
13. (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
14. (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
15. (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
16. (6, 8) does not form a triangle.
17. (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
18. (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
19. (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
20. (8, 2) forms a triangle with node 6: <2, 6, 8>.
21. (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
22. (9, 3) does not form a triangle.
23. (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <2, 6, 8>
