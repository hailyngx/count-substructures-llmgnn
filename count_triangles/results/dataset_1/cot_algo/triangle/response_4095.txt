Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 6 is connected to 1 node.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 5 are connected to 2 nodes each.
- Nodes 3 and 6 are connected to 3 nodes each.
- Nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to 5 nodes each.

By relabeling the nodes accordingly, we get:
- Node 6 -> 0 (smallest degree)
- Node 2 -> 1
- Node 4 -> 2
- Node 5 -> 3
- Node 3 -> 4
- Node 6 -> 5
- Node 1 -> 6
- Node 7 -> 7
- Node 8 -> 8
- Node 9 -> 9 (largest degree)

Now, we will check for triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (1, 2): Proceed.
    - Node 1 (degree 5) shares edges with nodes 2, 7, 8, 9.
        - Nodes 2, 8, 9 do not share a connection.
    - No triangles found.

- Edge (1, 3): Proceed.
    - Node 1 shares edges with nodes 3, 7, 9.
        - Nodes 3, 7 form a triangle with Node 1: <1, 3, 7>.
    - Found 1 triangle.

- Edge (1, 7): Skip (Node 1 has larger degree).

- Edge (1, 8): Skip (Node 1 has larger degree).

- Edge (1, 9): Skip (Node 1 has larger degree).

- Edge (3, 5): Proceed.
    - Node 3 shares edges with nodes 5, 9.
        - Nodes 5, 9 do not share a connection.
    - No triangles found.

- Edge (3, 9): Proceed.
    - Node 3 shares edges with nodes 9.
        - Node 9 shares an edge with Node 1 (previously checked).
    - No triangles found.

- Other edges will not lead to the formation of new triangles based on the previous analysis.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 3, 7>.
