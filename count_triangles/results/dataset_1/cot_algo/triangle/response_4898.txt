Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Nodes 1, 3, and 6 have degree 2
- Nodes 4 and 7 have degree 3
- Nodes 0 and 9 have degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5

Next, we will go through the edges based on the degree-based ordering:

1. Consider edge (0, 6):
   - Node 0 and Node 6 share nodes 7 and 8.
   - Triangle: <0, 6, 7>

2. Consider edge (0, 7):
   - Node 0 and Node 7 share nodes 6, 8, and 1.
   - Triangles: <0, 7, 6>, <0, 7, 1>, <7, 1, 0>

3. Consider edge (0, 8):
   - Node 0 and Node 8 share nodes 6, 7, and 9.
   - Triangles: <0, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 8, 9>, <8, 9, 0>

4. Consider edge (0, 9):
   - Node 0 and Node 9 share nodes 6, 8, and 4.
   - Triangle: <0, 9, 8>

5. Consider edge (1, 7):
   - Node 1 and Node 7 share node 0.
   - Triangle: <1, 7, 0>

6. Consider edge (2, 4):
   - Node 2 and Node 4 do not share any nodes.

7. Consider edge (3, 8):
   - Node 3 and Node 8 share node 0.
   - Triangle: <3, 8, 0>

8. Consider edge (4, 2):
   - Node 4 and Node 2 do not share any nodes.

9. Consider edge (4, 9):
   - Node 4 and Node 9 share nodes 0 and 8.
   - Triangle: <4, 9, 8>

10. Consider edge (6, 0):
   - Node 6 and Node 0 share nodes 7 and 8.
   - Triangle: <6, 0, 7>

11. Consider edge (7, 0):
   - Node 7 and Node 0 share nodes 6, 8, and 1.
   - Triangles: <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 6>, <0, 1, 7>

12. Consider edge (7, 1):
   - Node 7 and Node 1 share node 0.
   - Triangle: <7, 1, 0>

13. Consider edge (8, 0):
   - Node 8 and Node 0 share nodes 6, 7, and 9.
   - Triangles: <8, 0, 6>, <8, 0, 7>, <8, 0, 9>, <0, 9, 8>

14. Consider edge (8, 3):
   - Node 8 and Node 3 share node 0.
   - Triangle: <8, 3, 0>

15. Consider edge (8, 9):
   - Node 8 and Node 9 share nodes 0 and 4.
   - Triangle: <8, 9, 0>

16. Consider edge (9, 0):
   - Node 9 and Node 0 share nodes 6, 8, and 4.
   - Triangle: <9, 0, 8>

17. Consider edge (9, 4):
   - Node 9 and Node 4 share nodes 0 and 8.
   - Triangle: <9, 4, 8>

18. Consider edge (9, 8):
   - Node 9 and Node 8 share nodes 0 and 4.
   - Triangle: <9, 8, 0>

From this process, we find a total of 16 triangles, configured as follows within brackets []:
