Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given graph, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections (degree):

Vertex 0: Degree 2  
Vertex 1: Degree 3  
Vertex 3: Degree 2  
Vertex 5: Degree 2  
Vertex 2: Degree 4  
Vertex 7: Degree 4  
Vertex 9: Degree 4  
Vertex 6: Degree 5  

Based on this relabeling, the edges are now:  
(0, 2)  
(1, 2)  
(3, 5)  
(0, 2)  
(2, 1)  
(5, 9)  
(2, 7)  
(3, 6)  
(2, 0)  
(1, 7)  
(3, 6)  
(6, 9)  
(5, 3)  

Counting the triangles that form in this graph:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <1, 2, 7>
3. <2, 7, 6>
4. <2, 0, 1>
5. <2, 0, 6>
6. <5, 3, 6>
7. <5, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
