Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each vertex:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1

Ordering the vertices by their degree from least to most:

Nodes in order: 7, 3, 9, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6

Now, let's find the triangles:

- (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share Node 6 -> Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- (0, 5): No triangle
- (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 share Node 6 -> Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 share Node 4 -> Triangle <1, 6, 4>
- (2, 5): No triangle
- (2, 8): No triangle
- (3, 6): No triangle
- (4, 0): Already counted
- (4, 1): Already counted
- (4, 6): Already counted
- (5, 0): Already counted
- (5, 2): Already counted
- (6, 1): Already counted
- (6, 3): Already counted
- (6, 4): Already counted
- (6, 9): No triangle
- (7, 8): No triangle
- (8, 2): No triangle
- (8, 7): No triangle
- (9, 6): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [3]

The unique triangles found:
<0, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 4>
