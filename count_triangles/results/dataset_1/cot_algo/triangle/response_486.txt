Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have:
Vertices: 0(2), 7(2), 4(2), 5(2), 1(3), 3(3), 8(3), 6(4), 2(4), 9(6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:
1. Edge (0, 1) cannot form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connections 2 and 5: <0, 2, 5>.
3. Edge (1, 0) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 2).
4. Edge (1, 6) cannot form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connections 2 and 4: <1, 2, 4>.
6. Edge (2, 4) cannot form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 5) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 2).
8. Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with shared connections 1 and 9: <1, 2, 9>.
9. Edge (2, 9) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5 or step 8).
10. Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with shared connections 2 and 5: <0, 2, 5>.
11. Edge (3, 5) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 10).
12. Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections 6 and 9: <3, 6, 9>.
13. Edge (4, 2) cannot form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 9) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5).
15. Edge (5, 2) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 2 or step 10).
16. Edge (5, 3) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 10).
17. Edge (6, 1) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 4 or step 8).
18. Edge (6, 2) forms a triangle with shared connections 1 and 9: <1, 2, 9>.
19. Edge (6, 7) cannot form a triangle.
20. Edge (6, 9) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5 or step 8).
21. Edge (7, 6) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 19).
22. Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with shared connections 3 and 9: <3, 7, 9>.
23. Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with shared connections 6 and 9: <3, 6, 9>.
24. Edge (8, 7) forms a triangle with shared connections 3 and 9: <3, 7, 9>.
25. Edge (8, 9) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 12, step 22, or step 24).
26. Edge (9, 1) forms a triangle with shared connections 2 and 4: <1, 2, 4>.
27. Edge (9, 2) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5, step 8, or step 26).
28. Edge (9, 4) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5 or step 26).
29. Edge (9, 6) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 5 or step 8).
30. Edge (9, 8) cannot form a triangle (already counted in step 12, step 22, or step 24).

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 9>.
