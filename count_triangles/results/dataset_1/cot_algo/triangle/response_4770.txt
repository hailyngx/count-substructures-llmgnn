Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with nodes and edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes by degree: 
0: 2 edges
1: 2 edges
5: 2 edges
6: 3 edges
8: 3 edges
4: 4 edges
7: 4 edges
3: 4 edges
9: 4 edges
2: 6 edges

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on degrees and the number of connections they have, and then count the triangles:

New node labels: 
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
5 -> 2
6 -> 3
8 -> 4
4 -> 5
7 -> 6
3 -> 7
9 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we count the triangles based on the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
Triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [17]
