Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 6
- Node 9: degree = 3

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 6 (degree 1) -> Node 0
- Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 2
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 3
- Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 4
- Node 9 (degree 3) -> Node 5
- Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 6
- Node 2 (degree 5) -> Node 7
- Node 3 (degree 5) -> Node 8
- Node 8 (degree 6) -> Node 9

The sorted list of edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(6, 2) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the shared connections between the endpoints of each edge:
- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle 2: <0, 8, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle 5: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 6: <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
