Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 3: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 3 (1 connection) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 4 (1 connection) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (1 connection) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 5 (4 connections) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 6 (4 connections) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 (5 connections) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 7 (5 connections) -> Vertex 9

Now we will count the triangles based on the relabeled vertices:
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [2]
