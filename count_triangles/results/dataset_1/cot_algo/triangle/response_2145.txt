Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
0 -> 1  
1 -> 5  
2 -> 0  
3 -> 2  
4 -> 4  
5 -> 3  
6 -> 6  
7 -> 7  
8 -> 8  
9 -> 9  

The edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are:  
(0, 2) (2, 4) (4, 5) (6, 0) (3, 6) (7, 3) (8, 6)  

Analyzing these edges, we find the following triangles:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 6, 3>  
<3, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
