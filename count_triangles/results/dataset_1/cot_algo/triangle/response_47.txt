Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
7: 1 connection
9: 2 connections

Next, we relabel the vertices:

0: A
1: B
2: C
4: D
5: E
6: F
7: G
9: H

Now, we can go through the edges, starting from the one with the vertex of lower degree:

(0, 4): A (0) and D (1) do not form a triangle.
(0, 9): A (0) and H (2) do not form a triangle.
(1, 2): B (1) and C (1) do not form a triangle.
(1, 6): B (1) and F (2) do not form a triangle.
(2, 1): This edge is skipped because we only proceed when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
(4, 0): This edge is skipped for the same reason.
(5, 9): E (1) and H (2) do not form a triangle.
(6, 1): This edge is skipped.
(6, 7): F (2) and G (1) do not form a triangle.
(7, 6): This edge is skipped.
(9, 0): This edge is skipped.
(9, 5): H (2) and E (1) form a triangle: <5, 9, 0>.

Finally, we output the total number of triangles and the unique triangles found:

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <5, 9, 0>
