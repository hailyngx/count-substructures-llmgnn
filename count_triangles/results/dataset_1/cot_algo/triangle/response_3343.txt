Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling is as follows: 

Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
Vertices 6 and 7 have 1 connection each.
Vertices 8 and 2 have 1 connection each.
Vertices 4 and 6 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 1 and 8 have 2 connections each.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 4 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 9 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles and list them as follows:
  
Triangles: 
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 5]
