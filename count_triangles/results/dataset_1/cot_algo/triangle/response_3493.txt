Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:
Vertices: 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 2, 6, 0, 4, 8

Now, we can count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 2]
