Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 1 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 2 connections
Node 8 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 3 connections
Node 3 has 3 connections
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

For each edge, we will check for shared connections to find triangles. 

Counting the triangles, we get:

Total number of triangles is: [9]
Unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
