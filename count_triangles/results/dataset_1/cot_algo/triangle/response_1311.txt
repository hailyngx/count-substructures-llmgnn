Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the number of triangles and identify them:
1. <0, 2, 3>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <0, 2, 9>
4. <2, 6, 7>
5. <2, 7, 8>
6. <2, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
