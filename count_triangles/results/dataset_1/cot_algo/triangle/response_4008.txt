Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Nodes 4 and 8 have degree 3
- Nodes 5 and 6 have degree 4
- Nodes 1 and 7 have degree 5
- Nodes 2 and 3 have degree 6
- Node 0 has degree 7

We will now check for triangles based on the connections:

For edge (0, 1):
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8
- Shared neighbor: 1
Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 2> is found.

For edge (0, 2):
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 5, 7
- Shared neighbor: 0
Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 2> is found again.

For edge (0, 9):
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 6
- Shared neighbor: 0
Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 9> is found.

For edge (1, 3):
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 6, 7
- Shared neighbor: 1
Therefore, triangle <1, 3, 0> is found.

For edge (1, 5):
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2
- Shared neighbor: 1
Therefore, triangle <1, 5, 0> is found.

For edge (1, 8):
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 4, 7
- Shared neighbor: 1
Therefore, triangle <1, 8, 0> is found.

For edge (2, 5):
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 5, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2
- Shared neighbor: 2
Therefore, triangle <2, 5, 0> is found.

For edge (2, 7):
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 3, 8
- Shared neighbor: 2
Therefore, triangle <2, 7, 0> is found.

For edge (3, 7):
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 6, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 3, 8
- Shared neighbor: 3
Therefore, triangle <3, 7, 2> is found.

For edge (6, 9):
- Node 6 has neighbors 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 6
- Shared neighbor: 6
Therefore, triangle <6, 9, 0> is found.

Counting the unique triangles found, we have: [8].
