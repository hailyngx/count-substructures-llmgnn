Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 3, 7, 5, 9, 1, 0, 7, 4, 8, 2 

Calculating the triangles in the graph:
1. Edge (0, 2):
   Shared connections: 8
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>

2. Edge (0, 8):
   Shared connections: 2
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>

3. Edge (1, 5):
   No triangle formed

4. Edge (1, 6):
   No triangle formed

5. Edge (2, 6):
   No triangle formed

6. Edge (2, 7):
   No triangle formed

7. Edge (2, 8):
   Shared connections: 0
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>

8. Edge (4, 6):
   No triangle formed

9. Edge (4, 8):
   No triangle formed

10. Edge (4, 9):
   No triangle formed

11. Edge (5, 6):
   No triangle formed

12. Edge (6, 7):
   No triangle formed

13. Edge (6, 8):
   No triangle formed

14. Edge (6, 4):
   Shared connections: 8
   Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>

15. Edge (7, 8):
   No triangle formed

16. Edge (8, 0):
   Shared connections: 2
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>

17. Edge (8, 4):
   Shared connections: 6
   Triangle formed: <0, 4, 8>

18. Edge (9, 4):
   No triangle formed

Total number of triangles: [3]
