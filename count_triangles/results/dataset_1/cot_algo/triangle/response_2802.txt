Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 1 connection
Node 5 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 6 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 5), (7, 2), (6, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 4), (9, 8), (9, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 0), (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 0), (0, 3), (0, 2)

By checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<5, 1, 8>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 4, 8>
<9, 4, 3>
<3, 0, 2>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 2, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
