Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are:  
Node 0 -> degree: 3  
Node 1 -> degree: 3  
Node 6 -> degree: 2  
Node 8 -> degree: 3  
Node 3 -> degree: 3  
Node 5 -> degree: 3  
Node 7 -> degree: 4  
Node 2 -> degree: 4  
Node 4 -> degree: 3  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>  
Triangle 2: <0, 2, 4>  
[Total number of triangles: 2]
