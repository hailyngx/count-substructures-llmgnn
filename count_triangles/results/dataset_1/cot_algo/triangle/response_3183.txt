Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections
- Vertex 9 has 3 connections
- Vertex 1 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 2 has 4 connections
- Vertex 7 has 5 connections
- Vertex 3 has 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles based on the edges provided:
- Triangle <1, 3, 2> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <1, 3, 5> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <1, 4, 2> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <1, 4, 5> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle <1, 4, 9> (shared connection: 4)
- Triangle <3, 2, 7> (shared connection: 3)
- Triangle <3, 5, 4> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <3, 5, 9> (shared connection: 5)
- Triangle <4, 2, 7> (shared connection: 2)
- Triangle <4, 5, 9> (shared connection: 5)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10] inside brackets.
