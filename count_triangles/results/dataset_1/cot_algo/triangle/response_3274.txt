Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabeling them. 

The number of connections for each vertex in this graph are:  
Vertex 0: 3 connections  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertex 3: 1 connection  
Vertex 4: 1 connection  
Vertex 5: 1 connection  
Vertex 6: 1 connection  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 1 connection  
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Relabeling the vertices from lowest to highest connections:  
Vertex 2: 0 connections  
Vertex 3: 1 connection  
Vertex 4: 1 connection  
Vertex 5: 1 connection  
Vertex 6: 1 connection  
Vertex 1: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 0: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
1. (0, 2): Vertex 2 does not have any connections.
2. (0, 6): Vertex 6 does not have any connections.
3. (0, 7): Shared connection with vertex 0 at vertex 9. => Triangle <0, 7, 9>.
4. (1, 5): Vertex 5 does not have any connections.
5. (1, 9): Shared connection with vertex 1 at vertex 9. => Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
6. (2, 0): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
7. (3, 9): Vertex 3 does not have any connections.
8. (4, 8): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
9. (5, 1): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
10. (6, 0): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
11. (7, 0): Shared connection with vertex 0 at vertex 9. => Triangle <0, 7, 9>.
12. (7, 9): Shared connection with vertex 7 at vertex 0. => Triangle <0, 7, 9>.
13. (8, 4): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
14. (9, 1): Shared connection with vertex 9 at vertex 7. => Triangle <1, 7, 9>.
15. (9, 3): Does not meet the condition of the lower label having fewer connections.
16. (9, 7): Shared connection with vertex 9 at vertex 0. => Triangle <0, 7, 9>.

Finally, the total number of triangles inside brackets is: [2].
