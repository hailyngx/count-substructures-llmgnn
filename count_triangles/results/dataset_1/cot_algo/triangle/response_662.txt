Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 1 (degree 2): 1
Node 3 (degree 2): 2
Node 2 (degree 2): 3
Node 4 (degree 2): 4
Node 8 (degree 2): 5
Node 7 (degree 3): 6
Node 5 (degree 3): 7
Node 6 (degree 4): 8
Node 9 (degree 4): 9
Node 0 (degree 5): 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
<7, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 6>

Total number of triangles: [2]
