Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees from least to most connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 

Node 5 - Degree: 0  
Node 2 - Degree: 0  
Node 1 - Degree: 1  
Node 4 - Degree: 1  
Node 9 - Degree: 3  
Node 0 - Degree: 5  
Node 8 - Degree: 5  
Node 6 - Degree: 5  
Node 3 - Degree: 6  
Node 7 - Degree: 4  

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between the nodes based on the degree-based ordering.

Count of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 1>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
