Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Node 5 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 2 and 5 have 1 connection.
- Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 3, 6, 8 have 2 connections.
- Nodes 0, 1, 7 have 3 connections.
- Nodes 9 and 3 have 3 connections.
- Node 4 has 5 connections.

Based on the ordering above, we can count triangles as follows:

1. (0, 1, 4)
2. (0, 4, 7)
3. (3, 6, 7)
4. (3, 6, 8)
5. (4, 1, 0)
6. (4, 1, 2)
7. (4, 2, 0)
8. (4, 7, 0)
9. (4, 9, 5)
10. (4, 9, 8)

Count of Triangles: [10]
Unique Triangles: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 1, 0>, <4, 1, 2>, <4, 2, 0>, <4, 7, 0>, <4, 9, 5>, <4, 9, 8>
