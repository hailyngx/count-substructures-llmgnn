Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their number of connections from least to most:
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections

Next, we will go through the edges in the graph starting from the one involving the node with the lowest label:
1. Edge: (4, 0) - Not considered as node 4 has the lowest label but has fewer connections.
2. Edge: (7, 6) - Not considered as both nodes have the same number of connections.
3. Edge: (8, 3) - Considered as node 8 has the lowest label and fewer connections. We check shared connections and find a triangle with node 5: <3, 5, 8>.
4. Edge: (9, 1) - Considered as node 9 has the lowest label and fewer connections. We check shared connections and find a triangle with node 5: <1, 5, 9>.
5. Edge: (0, 2) - Considered as node 0 has the lowest label and fewer connections. We check shared connections and find a triangle with node 5: <0, 2, 5>.
6. Edge: (6, 0) - Considered as node 6 has the lowest label and fewer connections. We check shared connections and find a triangle with node 2: <0, 2, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <3, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <0, 2, 5>.
