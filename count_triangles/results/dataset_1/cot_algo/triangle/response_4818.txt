Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
- Vertex 4: 0 connections
- Vertex 8: 0 connections
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections

The number of triangles inside brackets [] is: [4]

The unique triangles are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 9>
