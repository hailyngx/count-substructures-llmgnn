Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Vertices: (0:4), (2:2), (3:4), (4:3), (5:2), (6:6), (7:3), (8:4), (9:3)

Now, we will count the triangles present in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): Check shared connections: 6
2. Edge (0, 5): No action
3. Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections: 3, 5
4. Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections: 3, 7
5. Edge (2, 4): Check shared connections: None
6. Edge (2, 9): Check shared connections: 6
7. Edge (3, 6): Check shared connections: 0, 4, 5
8. Edge (3, 7): Check shared connections: 4
9. Edge (3, 8): Check shared connections: 0, 7
10. Edge (4, 6): Check shared connections: 0, 7
11. Edge (4, 7): Check shared connections: 3, 6, 8
12. Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections: 0
13. Edge (6, 9): Check shared connections: 0, 2
14. Edge (7, 8): Check shared connections: 3
15. Edge (8, 9): Check shared connections: 2, 6

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 7, 8>
<2, 6, 9>
