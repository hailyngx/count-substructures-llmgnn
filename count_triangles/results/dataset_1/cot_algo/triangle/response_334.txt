Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 2 has 1 connection.
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 0 has 4 connections.
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
Vertex 6 has 5 connections.
Vertex 4 has 9 connections.

Based on these labels, we will now check each edge to count the number of triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [23]
