Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 5: Degree 5  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 9: Degree 3  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph. Here is the calculation:  
1. Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <0, 3, 4>  
2. Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 5, 2>  
3. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 3, 4>  
4. Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.  
5. Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <2, 4, 7>  
6. Edge (2, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <2, 5, 0>  
7. Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.  
8. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.  
9. Edge (3, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <3, 1, 4>  
10. Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <3, 4, 7>  
11. Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <4, 7, 5>  
12. Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <5, 0, 3>  
13. Edge (5, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <5, 2, 4>  
14. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.  
15. Edge (5, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <5, 7, 4>  
16. Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.  
17. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.  
18. Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <7, 4, 2>  
19. Edge (7, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <7, 5, 2>  
20. Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.  
21. Edge (8, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <8, 4, 7>  
22. Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.  
23. Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.  
24. Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.  

There are a total of 12 triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 5, 2>  
<1, 3, 4>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 5, 0>  
<3, 1, 4>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<4, 7, 5>  
<5, 0, 3>  
<5, 2, 4>  
<5, 7, 4>  
<7, 5, 2>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
