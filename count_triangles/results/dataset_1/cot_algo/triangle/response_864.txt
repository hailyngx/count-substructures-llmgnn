Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering method, we analyze the edges in the following order:
(0, 5): 0 and 5 have 2 shared connections: 1, 3. <0, 1, 5>
(1, 3): 1 and 3 have 2 shared connections: 2, 5. <1, 2, 3>
(1, 5): 1 and 5 have 2 shared connections: 3, 4. <1, 3, 5>
(1, 6): 1 and 6 have 2 shared connections: 2, 3. <1, 2, 6>
(1, 9): 1 and 9 have 2 shared connections: 4, 8. <1, 4, 9>
(2, 3): 2 and 3 have 2 shared connections: 1, 6. <2, 1, 3>
(2, 6): 2 and 6 have 2 shared connections: 1, 3. <2, 1, 6>
(3, 5): 3 and 5 have 3 shared connections: 1, 4, 6. <3, 1, 5> <3, 4, 5> <3, 1, 2>
(4, 5): 4 and 5 have 2 shared connections: 1, 3. <4, 1, 5>
(4, 6): 4 and 6 have 2 shared connections: 1, 3. <4, 1, 6>
(4, 9): 4 and 9 have 2 shared connections: 1, 8. <4, 1, 9>
(5, 0): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (0) has more connections.
(5, 1): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (1) has more connections.
(5, 3): 5 and 3 have 3 shared connections: 1, 4, 6. <5, 1, 3> <5, 4, 3> <5, 1, 2>
(6, 1): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (1) has more connections.
(6, 2): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (2) has more connections.
(6, 4): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (4) has more connections.
(6, 7): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (6) has more connections.
(6, 8): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (6) has more connections.
(7, 6): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (6) has more connections.
(8, 6): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (6) has more connections.
(8, 9): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (8) has more connections.
(9, 1): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (1) has more connections.
(9, 4): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (4) has more connections.
(9, 8): Edge ignored as the node with the lower label (8) has more connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
