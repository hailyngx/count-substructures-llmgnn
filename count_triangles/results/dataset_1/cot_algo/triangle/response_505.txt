Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections: 

Vertices: 
2 -> degree 1
4 -> degree 1
9 -> degree 1
5 -> degree 1
6 -> degree 2
1 -> degree 0
0 -> degree 4
3 -> degree 3
8 -> degree 2
7 -> degree 4

After relabeling the vertices based on the sorted degree, we have the new vertex order: 
2 -> 0
4 -> 1
9 -> 2
5 -> 3 
6 -> 4
1 -> 5
0 -> 6
3 -> 7
8 -> 8
7 -> 9

Now, we check the given edges following the rule to proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(<5, 0>): Shared connections: (7)
(<4, 7>): Shared connections: (6)
(<2, 6>): Shared connections: (7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. 
The unique triangles found are: <5, 0, 7>, <4, 7, 6>, <2, 6, 7>.
