Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 - Label 9
Vertex 7 - Label 2
Vertex 8 - Label 1
Vertex 3 - Label 3
Vertex 2 - Label 6
Vertex 5 - Label 4
Vertex 9 - Label 5
Vertex 1 - Label 8
Vertex 6 - Label 7
Vertex 4 - Label 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 0, 8>
<4, 1, 0>
<5, 1, 0>
<6, 1, 0>
<4, 3, 5>
<6, 3, 5>
<6, 2, 9>
<6, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
