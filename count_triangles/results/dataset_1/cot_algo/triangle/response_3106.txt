Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 

Node 0 with degree 1  
Node 4 with degree 1  
Node 6 with degree 1  
Node 8 with degree 1  
Node 9 with degree 1  
Node 7 with degree 2  
Node 3 with degree 2  
Node 2 with degree 3  
Node 1 with degree 6  
Node 5 with degree 8  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 7):
Node 0 and Node 7 share no common connections.

Checking edge (1, 2):
Node 1 and Node 2 share 2 common connections: Node 5 and Node 3.
This forms the triangle <1, 2, 5>.

Checking edge (1, 3):
Node 1 and Node 3 share 1 common connection: Node 5.
This forms the triangle <1, 3, 5>.

Checking edge (2, 1): We skip this edge as Node 1 has more connections than Node 2.

Checking edge (3, 1): We skip this edge as Node 1 has more connections than Node 3.

Checking edge (4, 5):
Node 4 and Node 5 share no common connections.

Checking edge (5, 1): We skip this edge as Node 1 has more connections than Node 5.

Checking edge (5, 2): We skip this edge as Node 2 has more connections than Node 5.

Checking edge (5, 3): We skip this edge as Node 3 has more connections than Node 5.

Checking edge (5, 4):
Node 4 and Node 5 share no common connections.

Checking edge (5, 6):
Node 5 and Node 6 share no common connections.

Checking edge (5, 9):
Node 5 and Node 9 share no common connections.

Checking edge (6, 5): We skip this edge as Node 5 has more connections than Node 6.

Checking edge (7, 0):
Node 0 and Node 7 share no common connections.

Checking edge (7, 1):
Node 7 and Node 1 share 1 common connection: Node 5.
This forms the triangle <1, 7, 5>.

Checking edge (8, 1):
Node 8 and Node 1 share no common connections.

Checking edge (9, 5):
Node 9 and Node 5 share no common connections.

After checking all suitable edges, we count a total of 3 triangles:
