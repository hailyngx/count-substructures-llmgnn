Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, we have the following list of connections based on the number of connections:

Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 10: 0 connections

Using the given edges with the lowest labeled vertex having fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

- <0, 3, 4>
- <0 ,5, 6>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
