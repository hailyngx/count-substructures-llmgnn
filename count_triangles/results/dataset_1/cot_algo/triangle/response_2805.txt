Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 8 has 0 connections.
- Node 6 has 1 connection.
- Node 4 has 1 connection.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 5 connections.
- Node 1 has 6 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we explore each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 3> with shared connection: 0-2-3.
- Triangle <0, 3, 5> with shared connection: 0-3-5.
- Triangle <0, 3, 7> with shared connection: 0-3-7.
- Triangle <0, 5, 7> with shared connection: 0-5-7.
- Triangle <1, 6, 7> with shared connection: 1-6-7.
- Triangle <2, 3, 4> with shared connection: 2-3-4.
- Triangle <3, 5, 7> with shared connection: 3-5-7.
- Triangle <3, 5, 9> with shared connection: 3-5-9.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [8] within the graph.
