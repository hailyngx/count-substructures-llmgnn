Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:

Node 0 - Degree 2
Node 1 - Degree 2
Node 4 - Degree 2
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 7 - Degree 3
Node 9 - Degree 3
Node 3 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 5 - Degree 6
Node 2 - Degree 7

After relabeling, we list the edges in ascending order of labels for the first vertex:
(0, 6) (0, 7)
(1, 5) (1, 7)
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9)
(3, 5) (3, 8)
(4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9)
(5, 7) (5, 9)
(6, 7)
(8, 9)

Now, we count the triangles by considering shared neighbors for each edge:
- Triangle <0, 6, 7> from edges (0, 6), (0, 7), and (6, 7)
- Triangle <2, 3, 5> from edges (2, 3), (2, 5), and (3, 5)
- Triangle <2, 5, 9> from edges (2, 5), (2, 9), and (5, 9)
- Triangle <4, 5, 8> from edges (4, 5), (4, 8), and (5, 8)

Finally, we count the total number of triangles:
