Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree. Here is the list of vertices sorted from least connected to most connected:

Vertices: 6, 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, 5, 4, 0, 2

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Both vertices 0 and 2 are connected to vertex 4.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>

2. Edge (0, 3):
   - Both vertices 0 and 3 are connected to vertex 4.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 4>

3. Edge (0, 4):
   - Both vertices 0 and 4 are connected to vertices 2 and 3.
   - Triangles formed: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 3, 4>

4. Edge (0, 7):
   - No triangles formed.

5. Edge (1, 2):
   - No triangles formed.

6. Edge (1, 4):
   - Triangle formed: <1, 0, 4>

7. Edge (1, 9):
   - No triangles formed.

8. Edge (2, 0):
   - No triangles formed.

9. Edge (2, 1):
   - No triangles formed.

10. Edge (2, 4):
    - Triangle formed: <2, 0, 4>

11. Edge (2, 5):
    - No triangles formed.

12. Edge (2, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

13. Edge (3, 0):
    - No triangles formed.

14. Edge (3, 4):
    - Triangle formed: <3, 0, 4>

15. Edge (3, 5):
    - No triangles formed.

16. Edge (4, 0):
    - No triangles formed.

17. Edge (4, 1):
    - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 1>

18. Edge (4, 2):
    - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 2>

19. Edge (4, 3):
    - Triangle formed: <4, 0, 3>

20. Edge (5, 2):
    - No triangles formed.

21. Edge (5, 3):
    - No triangles formed.

22. Edge (5, 7):
    - No triangles formed.

23. Edge (7, 0):
    - No triangles formed.

24. Edge (7, 5):
    - No triangles formed.

25. Edge (8, 2):
    - No triangles formed.

26. Edge (8, 9):
    - No triangles formed.

27. Edge (9, 1):
    - No triangles formed.

28. Edge (9, 8):
    - No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles in the graph: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <1, 0, 4>, <4, 0, 1>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 3>
