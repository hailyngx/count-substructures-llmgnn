Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's label the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 1
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 is not connected to any node
Vertex 5 is not connected to any node
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 7 has degree 3
Vertex 8 has degree 1
Vertex 9 has degree 1

Considering the edges in order and ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 7>
2. <1, 3, 6>
3. <2, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
