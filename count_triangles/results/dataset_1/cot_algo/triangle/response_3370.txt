Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 4 : Degree 2
Node 9 : Degree 2
Node 3 : Degree 1
Node 7 : Degree 2
Node 5 : Degree 3
Node 1 : Degree 2
Node 6 : Degree 3
Node 2 : Degree 4
Node 0 : Degree 7
Node 8 : Degree 5

Using this ordering and only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
