Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 4: 0 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will calculate the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 1 (common connection is node 8). Triangle formed: <0, 1, 8>.

2. Edge (0, 3): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 3 (common connection is node 9). Triangle formed: <0, 3, 9>.

3. Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections between nodes 0 and 6 (common connection is node 5). Triangle formed: <0, 6, 5>.

4. Edge (0, 8): No triangle is formed with this edge.

5. Edge (0, 9): No triangle is formed with this edge.

6. Edge (1, 2): No triangle is formed with this edge.

7. Edge (1, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 1 and 7 (common connection is node 9). Triangle formed: <1, 7, 9>.

8. Edge (2, 1): No triangle is formed with this edge.

9. Edge (3, 0): Already counted as edge (0, 3).

10. Edge (3, 6): Check shared connections between nodes 3 and 6 (common connection is node 0). Triangle formed: <3, 6, 0>.

11. Edge (3, 7): Check shared connections between nodes 3 and 7 (common connection is node 9). Triangle formed: <3, 7, 9>.

12. Edge (3, 9): No new triangle is formed with this edge.

Now, we have found three unique triangles. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
