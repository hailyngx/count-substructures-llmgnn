Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Vertex 0 has degree 2  
Vertex 1 has degree 2  
Vertex 4 has degree 1  
Vertex 7 has degree 1  
Vertex 3 has degree 3  
Vertex 6 has degree 3  
Vertex 5 has degree 4  
Vertex 8 has degree 5  
Vertex 9 has degree 5  
Vertex 2 has degree 6  

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

We only consider edges starting from vertices with lower labels if they have fewer connections.  

Triangles found:  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<1, 2, 5>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<3, 6, 8>  
<6, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
