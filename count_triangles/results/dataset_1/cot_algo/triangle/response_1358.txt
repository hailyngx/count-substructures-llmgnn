Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: Degree 5
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 6: Degree 1
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 8: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge based on the labels of the vertices involved.

Examining the edges in the given order, we find the following triangles:
- Edge (0, 2) forms triangles with vertices 3 and 7: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (0, 6) forms no triangles.
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with vertices 3 and 8: <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>
- Edge (0, 8) forms no triangles.
- Edge (1, 2) forms no triangles.
- Edge (1, 9) forms no triangles.
- Edge (2, 0) forms no triangles.
- Edge (2, 1) forms no triangles.
- Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <2, 3, 9>
- Edge (2, 9) forms no triangles.
- Edge (3, 0) forms no triangles.
- Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <3, 2, 9>
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <3, 7, 9>
- Edge (6, 0) forms no triangles.
- Edge (7, 0) forms no triangles.
- Edge (7, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <7, 3, 9>
- Edge (7, 8) forms no triangles.
- Edge (7, 9) forms no triangles.
- Edge (8, 0) forms no triangles.
- Edge (8, 7) forms no triangles.
- Edge (9, 1) forms no triangles.
- Edge (9, 2) forms no triangles.
- Edge (9, 3) forms no triangles.
- Edge (9, 7) forms no triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 2, 9>, and <3, 7, 9>.
