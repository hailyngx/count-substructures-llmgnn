Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 6 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
3: 5 connections
9: 6 connections
4: 7 connections
5: 6 connections
6: 6 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 2): 0 and 2 have 6 common connections (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
(0, 3): 0 and 3 have 3 common connections (4, 5, 6) forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
(0, 4): 0 and 4 have 4 common connections (5, 6, 8, 9) forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(0, 5): 0 and 5 have 4 common connections (6, 8, 9, 4) forming a triangle <0, 5, 6>.
(0, 6): 0 and 6 have 5 common connections (4, 5, 8, 9, 2) forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
(0, 8): 0 and 8 have 2 common connections (4, 9) forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
(1, 3): 1 and 3 have 1 common connection (5) forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
(1, 5): 1 and 5 have 2 common connections (4, 9) forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
(1, 9): 1 and 9 have 2 common connections (5, 4) forming a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
(2, 6): 2 and 6 have 2 common connections (0, 3) forming a triangle <2, 0, 3>.
(3, 1): 3 and 1 have 1 common connection (5) forming a triangle <3, 1, 5>.
(3, 6): 3 and 6 have 2 common connections (0, 4) forming a triangle <3, 0, 4>.
(4, 5): 4 and 5 have 3 common connections (6, 8, 9) forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(4, 6): 4 and 6 have 4 common connections (0, 5, 9, 3) forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(5, 9): 5 and 9 have 3 common connections (1, 4, 6) forming a triangle <5, 4, 9>.
(6, 0): 6 and 0 have 5 common connections (4, 5, 8, 9, 2) forming a triangle <6, 0, 2>.
(6, 2): 6 and 2 have 2 common connections (0, 3) forming a triangle <6, 0, 3>.
(6, 4): 6 and 4 have 4 common connections (0, 5, 9, 3) forming a triangle <6, 4, 5>.
(6, 5): 6 and 5 have 4 common connections (4, 8, 9, 0) forming a triangle <6, 4, 5>.
(6, 9): 6 and 9 have 4 common connections (0, 4, 5, 3) forming a triangle <6, 4, 5>.
(7, 4): 7 and 4 have 1 common connection (9) forming a triangle <7, 4, 9>.
(7, 9): 7 and 9 have 1 common connection (4) forming a triangle <7, 4, 9>.
(8, 0): 8 and 0 have 2 common connections (4, 9) forming a triangle <8, 4, 9>.
(9, 1): 9 and 1 have 2 common connections (5, 4) forming a triangle <9, 1, 5>.
(9, 3): 9 and 3 have 3 common connections (1, 4, 6) forming a triangle <9, 4, 6>.
(9, 4): 9 and 4 have 4 common connections (5, 6, 0, 3) forming a triangle <9, 4, 5>.
(9, 5): 9 and 5 have 3 common connections (1, 4, 6) forming a triangle <9, 4, 6>.
(9, 6): 9 and 6 have 4 common connections (0, 4, 5, 3) forming a triangle <9, 4, 5>.
