Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding connections:

(1) - 0 connections: 1
(2) - 1 connection: 8, 9
(3) - 2 connections: 2, 4, 7
(4) - 3 connections: 5
(5) - 4 connections: 1
(6) - 5 connections: 0, 6
(7) - 6 connections: 3
(8) - 7 connections: None
(9) - 8 connections: None
(10) - 9 connections: None

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
   - (2, 3): Vertices 2 and 3 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle <2, 3, 8>.
   - (3, 6): Vertices 3 and 6 share a connection with vertex 8, forming a triangle <3, 6, 8>.
   - (4, 5): Vertices 4 and 5 share a connection with vertex 6, forming a triangle <4, 5, 6>.

There is a total of **3 triangles** in the given graph, which are <2, 3, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, and <4, 5, 6>. 

Therefore, the answer is [3].
