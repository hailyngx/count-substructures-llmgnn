Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertices 1, 3, 4, 6: 1 connection each
Vertices 0, 9: 2 connections each
Vertices 5, 7: 7 connections each 

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices 0, 1: 1
Vertices 3, 4, 6: 2
Vertices 5, 7: 3

Next, we'll check for triangles by considering each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 7): Both vertices are labeled 1, so we don't count a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 (label 1) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 3, so triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 (label 2) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 1, so triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 (label 2) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 1, so triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- Edge (5, 1): Both vertices are labeled 3, so we don't count a triangle.
- Edge (5, 3): Both vertices are labeled 3, so we don't count a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4): Both vertices are labeled 3, so we don't count a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6): Both vertices are labeled 3, so we don't count a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 7 (label 3). Shared connections with Vertices 0, 6, so triangles <0, 5, 7> and <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 5): Vertex 6 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 7, so triangle <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 7 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 5, so triangle <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 0): Vertex 7 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 0 (label 1). Shared connection with Vertex 5, so triangle <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 5 (label 3). Shared connections with Vertices 0, 6, so triangles <0, 5, 7> and <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 6): Vertex 7 (label 3) has fewer connections than Vertex 6 (label 3). Shared connection with Vertex 5, so triangle <5, 6, 7>.

After checking all edges, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 5, 7>, <5, 6, 7>.
