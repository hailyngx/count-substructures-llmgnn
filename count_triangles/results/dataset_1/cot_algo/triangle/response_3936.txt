Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices Degrees:
0 - 5
1 - 3
2 - 4
3 - 4
4 - 2
5 - 4
6 - 3
7 - 3
8 - 2
9 - 6

Now, relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertices Sorted by Degree:
1 - 0
4 - 1
6 - 2
7 - 3
8 - 4
0 - 5
2 - 6
3 - 7
5 - 8
9 - 9

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
