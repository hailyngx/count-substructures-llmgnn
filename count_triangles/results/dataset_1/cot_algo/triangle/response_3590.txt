Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their degree. The degrees of the vertices in this graph are: 
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

Next, we relabel the nodes as follows based on their degree (starting from 0):
- Node 2 -> 0
- Node 4 -> 1
- Node 6 -> 2
- Node 8 -> 3
- Node 3 -> 4
- Node 5 -> 5
- Node 7 -> 6
- Node 9 -> 7
- Node 1 -> 8
- Node 0 -> 9

Now, we can go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6: <4, 6, 0>
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 4: <4, 6, 0>
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9: <0, 7, 6>
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 6: <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 9: <1, 5, 3>
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9: <3, 5, 1>
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <3, 7, 0>
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <3, 8, 0>
- Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 6: <4, 0, 1>
- Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <5, 1, 0>
- Edge (5, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9: <5, 3, 1>
- Edge (6, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 4: <6, 0, 1>
- Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 9: <7, 0, 1>
- Edge (8, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 9: <8, 3, 0>

Counting all the triangles found, the total number of triangles in this graph is 14. 
Therefore, the output is: [14]
