Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 0
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges based on the new labels:
- Edge (0, 4): Forms triangles with 3, 7
- Edge (1, 5): Forms triangles with 9
- Edge (1, 6): Forms triangles with 9
- Edge (1, 7): Forms triangles with 9
- Edge (1, 9): Forms triangles with 5, 6, 7
- Edge (3, 4): Forms triangles with 7
- Edge (4, 7): Forms triangles with 1
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangles with 1

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [10], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 9>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 1>, <7, 8, 1>.
