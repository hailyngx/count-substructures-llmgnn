Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following mapping:
Node 7 -> 0 edges
Node 0 -> 2 edges
Node 1 -> 2 edges
Node 4 -> 0 edges
Node 8 -> 4 edges
Node 5 -> 3 edges
Node 3 -> 4 edges
Node 9 -> 4 edges
Node 6 -> 4 edges
Node 2 -> 5 edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with the edges and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle <0, 3, 6>.
  
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.

3. Edge (1, 3): Forms triangle with node 9. Triangle <1, 3, 9>.

4. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.

5. Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with node 8. Triangle <2, 6, 8>.

6. Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 6 and 9. Triangles <2, 6, 8> and <2, 6, 9>.

7. Edge (2, 9): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle <2, 6, 9>.

8. Edge (3, 0): No triangles formed.

9. Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.

10. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.

11. Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.

12. Edge (5, 6): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 5, 6>.

13. Edge (5, 9): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 5, 9>.

14. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.

15. Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.

16. Edge (6, 5): Forms triangle with nodes 2 and 9. Triangles <2, 5, 6> and <2, 6, 9>.

17. Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.

18. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.

19. Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.

20. Edge (8, 6): No triangles formed.

21. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.

22. Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.

23. Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed.

24. Edge (9, 5): Forms triangle with node 2. Triangle <2, 5, 9>.

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [7].
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>.
