Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections they have:

- Vertex 3: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 4 connections

Now starting from the vertex with the lowest degree, we have the new labeling:
- Vertex 3: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 6 connections
- Vertex 8: 7 connections
- Vertex 0: 8 connections

Next, we will count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 4): No triangle formed.
- For edge (0, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (0, 6): Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- For edge (0, 8): Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
- For edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
- For edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 0): No triangle formed.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
- For edge (5, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 5>.
- For edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
- For edge (6, 0): Triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- For edge (6, 8): Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- For edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
- For edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
- For edge (8, 0): Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- For edge (8, 6): Triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- For edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles found: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 6, 8>.
