Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following new labels for the vertices:
- Node 2 (Degree: 2)
- Node 6 (Degree: 2)
- Node 1 (Degree: 2)
- Node 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 3 (Degree: 4)
- Node 5 (Degree: 5)
- Node 8 (Degree: 6)
- Node 4 (Degree: 6)
- Node 0 (Degree: 7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now check for triangles:
1. Node 2 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 5 forming the triangle <2, 5, 6>.
2. Node 2 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 8 forming the triangle <2, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
