Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 2: 0 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Next, we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 has 4 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 3: 0, 6, 7
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 4 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
3. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has 4 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 7: 1, 3, 9
   - Added triangle: <0, 3, 7>
4. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 5: 9
5. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
6. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
7. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has 5 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 3 and Node 6: 0
   - Added triangle: <0, 3, 6>
8. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 has 5 connections, Node 7 has 3 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 3 and Node 7: 0
   - Added triangle: <0, 3, 7>
9. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 has 3 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 5: 9
10. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 2 connections. No need to process this edge.
11. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 4 and Node 9: 5
   - Added triangle: <4, 5, 9>
12. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 has 3 connections, Node 9 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 5 and Node 9: 4
   - Added triangle: <4, 5, 9>
13. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has 3 connections, Node 8 has 2 connections. No need to process this edge.
14. Edge (7, 1): Node 7 has 3 connections, Node 1 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
15. Edge (7, 3): Node 7 has 3 connections, Node 3 has 5 connections. We proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 7 and Node 3: 0
   - Added triangle: <0, 3, 7>
16. Edge (8, 6): Node 8 has 2 connections, Node 6 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
17. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 has 3 connections, Node 1 has 3 connections. No need to process this edge.
18. Edge (9, 4): Node 9 has 3 connections, Node 4 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 9 and Node 4: 5
   - Added triangle: <4, 5, 9>
19. Edge (9, 5): Node 9 has 3 connections, Node 5 has 3 connections. So, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 9 and Node 5: 4
   - Added triangle: <4, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <4, 5, 9>
