Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are: 3, 7, 8, 5, 2, 6, 9, 1, 4, 0.

Analyzing each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 1>
<3, 9, 8>
<7, 0, 4>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 1, 9>
<5, 0, 4>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<9, 1, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [18].
