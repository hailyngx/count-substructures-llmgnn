Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are:  
Vertex 0 has 3 connections.  
Vertex 1 has 5 connections.  
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.  
Vertex 3 has 2 connections.  
Vertex 4 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.  
Vertex 6 has 6 connections.  
Vertex 7 has 5 connections.  
Vertex 8 has 4 connections.  
Vertex 9 has 3 connections.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  
The triangles found are:  
<0, 1, 7>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<6, 7, 9>  

There are a total of 8 triangles in this graph, which can be represented as [8].
