Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: <2, 0, 1, 9, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 4>.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

For edge (0, 1):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 4, and 8.
- Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0 and 4.
- Vertices 0, 1, and 4 form a triangle. 

For edge (0, 4):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 4, and 8.
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Vertices 0, 1, and 4 form a triangle.

For edge (0, 8):
- Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 4, and 8.
- Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Vertices 0, 8, and 9 form a triangle.

For edge (1, 4):
- Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0 and 4.
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Vertices 1, 4, and 3 form a triangle.

For edge (3, 4):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 6.
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Vertices 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle.

For edge (3, 5):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 6.
- Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 2, 7, 8.
- No triangle formed.

For edge (3, 6):
- Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 6.
- Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 2, 7, 8.
- No triangle formed.

For edge (4, 9):
- Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 4, 8.
- Vertices 4, 9, and 8 form a triangle.

For edge (5, 7):
- Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 2, 7, 8.
- Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 2, 5, 6.
- No triangle formed.

For edge (6, 7):
- Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 2, 7, 8.
- Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 2, 5, 6.
- Vertices 6, 7, and 2 form a triangle.

By counting the triangles formed, the total number of triangles is [4].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 4>, and <6, 7, 2>.
