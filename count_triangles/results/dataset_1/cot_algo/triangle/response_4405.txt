Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 5: 1 connection
Nodes 2, 8, 0: 2 connections
Nodes 6, 9: 3 connections
Nodes 1, 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 3: 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Nodes 2, 8, 0 (2 connections) -> Nodes 1, 2, 3
Nodes 6, 9 (3 connections) -> Nodes 4, 5
Nodes 1, 7 (4 connections) -> Nodes 6, 7
Node 4 (6 connections) -> Node 8
Node 3 (7 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

(0, 4): No triangle
(0, 7): No triangle
(1, 3): No triangle
(1, 4): No triangle
(1, 6): No triangle
(1, 8): No triangle
(2, 6): No triangle
(3, 1): No triangle
(3, 4): No triangle
(3, 7): Triangle <3, 1, 7> found
(3, 8): No triangle
(3, 9): No triangle
(4, 0): No triangle
(4, 1): No triangle
(4, 3): No triangle
(4, 5): No triangle
(5, 4): No triangle
(6, 1): No triangle
(6, 2): No triangle
(7, 0): No triangle
(7, 3): Triangle <7, 0, 4> found
(7, 9): No triangle
(8, 1): No triangle
(8, 3): No triangle
(9, 3): No triangle
(9, 7): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
