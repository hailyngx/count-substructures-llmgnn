Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertices: 3, 6
Vertices: 2, 5
Vertices: 1, 7
Vertices: 9
Vertices: 0, 8
Vertices: 4

The triangles in the graph are:
[6]

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is:
[1]
