Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:
- Node 4 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 7 and 2 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 8 have 4 connections each.
- Node 0 has 5 connections.

Next, we will relabel the vertices according to this order:
- Relabel node 4 as 0.
- Relabel nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9 as 1.
- Relabel nodes 7 and 2 as 2.
- Relabel nodes 1 and 8 as 3.
- Relabel node 0 as 4.

Now, we will list out the edges in the new order of vertices:
(4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (3, 2) (3, 1) (3, 1) (3, 3) (2, 3) (2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 3) (1, 1) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (4, 4) (3, 3) (3, 2) (3, 1) (3, 4) (1, 2) (1, 1)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections between vertices of each edge:
- We find 5 triangles: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 1, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
