Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order. Then, edges are processed using the vertices with lower degrees to avoid double-counting triangles.

The sorted list of vertices with their degrees:
(2: 1), (4: 1), (6: 2), (8: 2), (0: 3), (1: 4), (9: 4), (3: 5), (5: 5), (7: 7)

Now, we will go through each edge based on the degree ordering:
1. Edge (2, 7) - Skipped as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
2. Edge (4, 1) - Skipped as vertex 4 has fewer connections.
3. Edge (6, 3) - Processed: Shared connections with vertices 6 and 3: <3, 6, 5>
4. Edge (8, 9) - Processed: Shared connections with vertices 8 and 9: <5, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles inside brackets []:
[2]

Unique triangles found:
<3, 6, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
