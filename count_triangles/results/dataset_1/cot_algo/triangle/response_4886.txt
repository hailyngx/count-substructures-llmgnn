Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:  
Node 2 has 0 connections.  
Nodes 1 and 5 each have 1 connection.  
Nodes 9, 6, and 5 each have 2 connections.  
Nodes 7 and 1 each have 3 connections.  
Nodes 3 and 8 each have 4 connections.  
Node 0 has 5 connections.  

Using this ordering, we can now count the number of triangles:  

Checking edge (0, 3):  
Node 3 has 4 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections. Since 4 < 5, we find shared connections of Node 3: (6, 7, 8) and  Node 0: (4, 9). This forms triangles <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, and <0, 3, 8>.  

Checking edge (0, 4):  
Node 4 has 3 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections. Since 3 < 5, we find shared connections of Node 4: (1, 8) and  Node 0: (3, 9). This forms triangles <0, 4, 1> and <0, 4, 8>.  

Checking edge (0, 9):  
Node 9 has 2 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections. Since 2 < 5, we find shared connections of Node 9: () and  Node 0: (3, 4). This forms no new triangles.  

Checking edge (1, 4):  
Node 4 and Node 1 each have 3 connections. Since 3 is not less than 3, this does not form any new triangles.  

Checking edge (3, 6):  
Node 6 has 2 connections and Node 3 has 4 connections. Since 2 < 4, we find shared connections of Node 6: (8) and  Node 3: (0, 7). This forms triangle <3, 6, 8>.  

Checking edge (3, 7):  
Node 7 has 2 connections and Node 3 has 4 connections. Since 2 < 4, we find shared connections of Node 7: (5) and  Node 3: (0, 8). This forms triangle <3, 7, 5>.  

Checking edge (3, 8):  
Node 8 has 4 connections and Node 3 has 4 connections. Since 4 is not less than 4, this does not form any new triangles.  

Checking edge (4, 8):  
Node 8 has 4 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections. Since 3 < 4, we find shared connections of Node 8: (3, 6) and  Node 4: (0, 1). This forms triangle <4, 8, 0> and <4, 8, 1>.  

Total number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 5>.
