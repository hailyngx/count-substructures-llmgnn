Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 7, 0, 4, 6, 8, 5, 9, 1, 2, 3.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 3, 8>, <4, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
