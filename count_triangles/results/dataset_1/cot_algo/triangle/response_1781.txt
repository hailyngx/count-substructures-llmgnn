Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to arrange the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 6

After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0 [2]
Node 1 [2]
Node 2 [2]
Node 3 [3]
Node 4 [3]
Node 5 [3]
Node 6 [3]
Node 7 [1]
Node 8 [1]
Node 9 [1]

Now, we start counting triangles based on the given edges. 
- Edge (0, 5) is skipped as both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- Edge (2, 9) is skipped due to node ordering.
- Edge (3, 1) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (3, 4) is skipped as both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (3, 7) is skipped as node 7 has a lower degree than node 3.
- Edge (4, 9) is skipped as node 9 has a lower degree than node 4.
- Edge (5, 0) is skipped due to node ordering.
- Edge (5, 1) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (5, 6) forms a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 1) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (6, 5) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (6, 9) is skipped as both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (7, 3) is skipped due to the node ordering.
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle <1, 6, 9>.
- Edge (9, 2) is skipped due to node ordering.
- Edge (9, 4) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (9, 6) is skipped as it was already considered.
- Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle <1, 6, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 6>, and <1, 6, 9>.
