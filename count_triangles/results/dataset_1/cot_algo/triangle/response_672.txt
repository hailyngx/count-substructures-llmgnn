Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3

Next, we need to sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 becomes Node 0
- Node 1 becomes Node 1
- Node 4 becomes Node 2
- Node 5 becomes Node 3
- Node 9 becomes Node 4
- Node 3 becomes Node 5
- Node 6 becomes Node 6
- Node 2 becomes Node 7

We will now identify the triangles in the graph based on the degree-based ordering. Since edges should be processed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will consider the following edges:

1. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with node 9: <0, 2, 9>
2. Edge (0, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
5. Edge (2, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
7. Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with node 6: <2, 4, 6>
8. Edge (2, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
11. Edge (3, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
12. Edge (3, 5) doesn't form a triangle.
13. Edge (4, 1) doesn't form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
15. Edge (4, 6) doesn't form a triangle.
16. Edge (5, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
18. Edge (5, 9) doesn't form a triangle.
19. Edge (6, 2) doesn't form a triangle.
20. Edge (6, 3) doesn't form a triangle.
21. Edge (6, 4) doesn't form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 0) doesn't form a triangle.
23. Edge (9, 5) doesn't form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9> and <2, 4, 6>.
