Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted order of vertices in this graph is as follows: 

Vertices: 9, 1, 0, 8, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5

After sorting, we can see that the vertex with the lowest label (0) has 2 connections, and vertex 3 has 2 connections as well. So, we will analyze the edges involving these two vertices:

1. Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has connections with vertex 3 and vertex 8. Vertex 3 has connections with vertex 0, vertex 5, and vertex 6. Therefore, there is one triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>.

Total number of triangles: [1]
