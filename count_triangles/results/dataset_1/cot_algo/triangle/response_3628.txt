Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:
- Node 0 (Degree 2) is connected to nodes 1 and 6 (Degree 5) which form a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Node 1 (Degree 4) is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9 (Degree 5) which form triangles <1, 0, 9> and <1, 4, 9>.
- Node 2 (Degree 3) is connected to node 3 (Degree 4) which doesn't form a triangle.
- Node 3 (Degree 4) is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9 (Degree 5) which form a triangle <3, 2, 6> and <3, 6, 9>.
- Node 4 (Degree 4) is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8 (Degree 5) which form triangles <4, 1, 5>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, and <4, 5, 9>.
- Node 5 (Degree 3) is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8 (Degree 5) which form a triangle <5, 4, 7> and <5, 4, 8>.
- Node 6 (Degree 5) is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9 (Degree 5) which form triangles <6, 0, 3>, <6, 0, 4>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 0, 9>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 4, 8>, <6, 4, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
- Node 7 (Degree 2) is connected to node 5 (Degree 3) which doesn't form a triangle.
- Node 8 (Degree 5) is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9 (Degree 5) which form triangles <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, <8, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 5, 9>, and <8, 6, 9>.
- Node 9 (Degree 5) is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8 (Degree 5) which form triangles <9, 1, 3>, <9, 1, 4>, <9, 1, 7>, <9, 1, 8>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 3, 8>, <9, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].
