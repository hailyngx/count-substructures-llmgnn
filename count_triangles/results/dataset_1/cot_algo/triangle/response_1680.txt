Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
- Vertex 5: Degree 2
- Vertex 6: Degree 2
- Vertex 9: Degree 2
- Vertex 0: Degree 3
- Vertex 2: Degree 4
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 4
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 4: Degree 5
- Vertex 1: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check the edges:
1. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have degrees less than 4, so we proceed. They share vertex 4 which forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 9): Both vertices have degrees less than 4, so we proceed. They share no common vertex for a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has degree 6 while vertex 2 has degree 4, so we skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have degrees less than 4, so we proceed. They share vertex 4 which forms a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have degrees less than 5, so we proceed. They share no common vertex for a triangle.
6. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have degrees less than 5, so we proceed. They share vertex 4 which forms a triangle <1, 4, 8>.
7. The remaining edges follow a similar process but do not form new triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, and <1, 4, 8>.
