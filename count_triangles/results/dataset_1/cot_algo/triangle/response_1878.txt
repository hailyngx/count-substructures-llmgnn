Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Degree of each node:
0: 2
1: 3
2: 2
3: 4
4: 1
6: 2
7: 4
8: 1

Arranging nodes in Degree-Based Ordering:
4, 8, 0, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3

Calculating triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
Node 0 has connections: 1, 6
Node 1 has connections: 0, 2, 3
Shared connections: 1
Triangle: <0, 1, 3>

For edge (0, 6):
Node 0 has connections: 1, 6
Node 6 has connections: 0, 7
Shared connections: 0
Triangle: <0, 6, 7>

For edge (1, 2):
Node 1 has connections: 0, 2, 3
Node 2 has connections: 1, 7
Shared connections: 1
Triangle: <1, 2, 7>

For edge (1, 3):
Node 1 has connections: 0, 2, 3
Node 3 has connections: 1, 4, 7, 8
Shared connections: 1
Triangle: <1, 3, 7>

For edge (2, 7):
Node 2 has connections: 1, 7
Node 7 has connections: 2, 3, 6
Shared connections: 7
Triangle: <2, 7, 3>

For edge (3, 7):
Node 3 has connections: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 7 has connections: 2, 3, 6
Shared connections: 3, 7
Triangles: <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 6>

Total number of triangles: [5]
