Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows:
```
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 1 connection
Node 3 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 6 has 3 connections
Node 1 has 4 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 4 has 5 connections
Node 8 has 6 connections
Node 2 has 7 connections
```

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:
- Consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.
- Check for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge to form triangles.

Calculating the total number of triangles in the graph results in:

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 5, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
