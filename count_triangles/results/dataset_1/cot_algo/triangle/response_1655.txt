Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree: 

Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 7>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 3, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 7, 3>
7. Triangle <1, 7, 2>
8. Triangle <2, 7, 3>
9. Triangle <4, 9, 6>
10. Triangle <5, 9, 6>
11. Triangle <5, 9, 4>
12. Triangle <5, 9, 0>
13. Triangle <5, 9, 1>
14. Triangle <5, 0, 2>
15. Triangle <7, 2, 3>
16. Triangle <7, 2, 0>
17. Triangle <7, 3, 1>
18. Triangle <7, 3, 2>
19. Triangle <7, 1, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
