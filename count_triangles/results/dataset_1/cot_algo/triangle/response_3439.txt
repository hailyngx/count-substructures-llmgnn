Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of vertices will be as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 3: degree 2
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 1
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 3
Vertex 9: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 0>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
