Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the new order is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 6, 1, 7, 5, 3, 2, 4, 8

Now we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6): Forms triangle with vertices 7 and 8. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
- Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 1 and 4. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
- Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4. Triangle <1, 0, 4>
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4. Triangle <2, 0, 4>
- Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (4, 5): Forms triangle with vertices 1 and 8. Triangle <4, 1, 8>
- Edge (4, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 2. Triangle <4, 0, 2>
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 4): Forms triangle with vertices 1 and 8. Triangle <5, 1, 8>
- Edge (6, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 7 and 8. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
- Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 6 and 8. Triangle <7, 6, 8>
- Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 6. Triangle <7, 0, 6>
- Edge (8, 0): Forms triangle with vertices 6 and 7. Triangle <8, 6, 7>
- Edge (8, 1): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 4. Triangle <8, 0, 4>
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (8, 4): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 2. Triangle <8, 0, 2>
- Edge (8, 7): Forms triangle with vertices 0 and 6. Triangle <8, 0, 6>

Total number of triangles: [10]
Triangles: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 4>, <1, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 4>, <4, 1, 8>, <4, 0, 2>, <5, 1, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 6, 8>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 0, 6>
