Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new vertex labels are:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can now count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 4, 6>
6. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
7. Triangle <0, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [7]
