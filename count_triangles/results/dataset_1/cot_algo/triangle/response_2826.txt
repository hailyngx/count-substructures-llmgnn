Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3

Now, we will assign new labels to the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 1 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 0
- Node 6 (degree 1) will be relabeled as 1
- Node 3 (degree 2) will be relabeled as 2
- Node 8 (degree 3) will be relabeled as 3
- Node 0 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 4
- Node 2 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 5
- Node 4 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 6
- Node 7 (degree 4) will be relabeled as 7

Now, we will list the edges based on the new labels:
- (0, 4)
- (0, 5)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 7)
- (1, 0)
- (2, 0)
- (2, 5)
- (2, 6)
- (2, 7)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 5)
- (4, 6)
- (4, 7)
- (6, 4)
- (7, 0)
- (7, 2)
- (7, 4)
- (7, 6)
- (8, 6)
- (8, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the connections between the nodes:
- We find the following triangles:  
  <0, 2, 4>  
  <0, 2, 7>  
  <0, 4, 7>  
  <2, 4, 5>  
  <2, 4, 7>  
  <4, 6, 7>  

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
