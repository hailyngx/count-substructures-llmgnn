Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll calculate the degrees of each vertex:

- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 1 (degree 1) -> A
- Vertex 2 (degree 1) -> B
- Vertex 4 (degree 1) -> C
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> D
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) -> E
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) -> F
- Vertex 9 (degree 3) -> G
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> H
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> I
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> J

Now, we'll check for triangles by following the degree-based ordering method:

Triangles:
- <F, H, J>
- <F, G, J>
- <H, J, I>

Total number of triangles: [3]
