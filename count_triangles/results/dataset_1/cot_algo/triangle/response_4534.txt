Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

- Node 1 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 1 connection.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 7 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 2 has 6 connections.

Sorted nodes from least to most connections:
4, 3, 1, 5, 8, 7, 9, 6, 2

Now, we will count the triangles:
- (4, 3, 6) forms a triangle.
- (3, 1, 5) forms a triangle.
- (1, 5, 6) forms a triangle.
- (8, 7, 2) forms a triangle.
- (7, 9, 2) forms a triangle.
- (9, 6, 2) forms a triangle.
- (6, 2, 7) forms a triangle.
- (6, 2, 9) forms a triangle.
- (2, 7, 9) forms a triangle.

There are 9 triangles in total.

Therefore, the output is: [9] 

The unique triangles found are:
<4, 3, 6>
<3, 1, 5>
<1, 5, 6>
<8, 7, 2>
<7, 9, 2>
<9, 6, 2>
<6, 2, 7>
<6, 2, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
