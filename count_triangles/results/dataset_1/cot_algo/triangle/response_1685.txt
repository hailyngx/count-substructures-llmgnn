Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their number of connections from least to most. Then, we re-label the nodes accordingly. The sorted labels will be as follows:
Node 3 - 0 connections
Nodes 0, 9 - 1 connection
Nodes 1, 7 - 2 connections
Nodes 5, 8 - 3 connections
Nodes 2 - 4 connections
Node 4 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 6 connections

Now, we will check each edge based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
1. Edge (0, 2): Both nodes 0 and 2 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
2. Edge (0, 4): Both nodes 0 and 4 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 1 connection, node 6 has 6 connections. Forming a triangle with node 3.
4. Edge (1, 2): Both nodes 1 and 2 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
5. Edge (1, 4): Both nodes 1 and 4 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (1, 5): Both nodes 1 and 5 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 has 2 connections, node 6 has 6 connections. Forming a triangle with node 3.
8. Edge (2, 0): Both nodes 0 and 2 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
9. Edge (2, 1): Both nodes 1 and 2 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
10. Edge (2, 4): Both nodes 2 and 4 have 4 connections. Forming a triangle with node 3.
11. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 has 4 connections, node 7 has 2 connections. Forming a triangle with node 1.
12. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 has 0 connections, node 6 has 6 connections. No triangle is formed.
13. Edge (4, 0): Both nodes 0 and 4 have 1 connection. No triangle is formed.
14. Edge (4, 1): Both nodes 1 and 4 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (4, 2): Both nodes 2 and 4 have 4 connections. No triangle is formed.
16. Edge (4, 5): Both nodes 4 and 5 have 3 connections. Forming a triangle with node 2.
17. Edge (5, 1): Both nodes 1 and 5 have 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
18. Edge (5, 4): Both nodes 4 and 5 have 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
19. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 has 3 connections, node 8 has 2 connections. Forming a triangle with node 1.
20. Edge (6, 0): Node 0 has 1 connection, node 6 has 6 connections. Forming a triangle with node 3.
21. Edge (6, 1): Node 1 has 2 connections, node 6 has 6 connections. Forming a triangle with node 3.
22. Edge (6, 3): Node 3 has 0 connections, node 6 has 6 connections. No triangle is formed.
23. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 has 6 connections, node 9 has 0 connections. No triangle is formed.
24. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 has 4 connections, node 7 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
25. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 has 2 connections, node 8 has 3 connections. Forming a triangle with node 1.
26. Edge (8, 5): Node 5 has 3 connections, node 8 has 2 connections. No triangle is formed.
27. Edge (8, 7): Node 7 has 2 connections, node 8 has 3 connections. No triangle is formed.
28. Edge (9, 6): Node 6 has 6 connections, node 9 has 0 connections. No triangle is formed.
