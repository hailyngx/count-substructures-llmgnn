Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  
Node 0 has 4 connections  
Node 1 has 2 connections  
Node 4 has 4 connections  
Node 6 has 2 connections  
Node 9 has 2 connections  
Node 3 has 5 connections  
Node 7 has 5 connections  
Node 8 has 3 connections  
Node 2 has 5 connections  
Node 5 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
(0, 2) forms a triangle with node 3: <0, 2, 3>  
(0, 3) and (2, 0) form a triangle with node 1: <0, 3, 1>  
(0, 4) does not form a triangle  
(0, 8) does not form a triangle  
(1, 2) does not form a triangle  
(1, 3) and (3, 1) do not form triangles  
(2, 1) does not form a triangle  
(2, 3) does not form a triangle  
(2, 7) forms a triangle with node 4: <2, 7, 4>  
(2, 8) does not form a triangle  
(3, 0) and (3, 1) do not form triangles  
(3, 2) does not form a triangle  
(3, 5) forms a triangle with node 4: <3, 5, 4>  
(3, 6) does not form a triangle  
(4, 0) does not form a triangle  
(4, 5) and (5, 4) form a triangle with node 7: <4, 5, 7>  
(4, 6) does not form a triangle  
(4, 7) does not form a triangle  
(5, 3) forms a triangle with node 7: <5, 3, 7>  
(5, 4) does not form a triangle  
(5, 7) does not form a triangle  
(5, 8) does not form a triangle  
(5, 9) does not form a triangle  
(6, 3) does not form a triangle  
(6, 4) does not form a triangle  
(7, 2) does not form a triangle  
(7, 4) does not form a triangle  
(7, 5) does not form a triangle  
(7, 9) does not form a triangle  
(8, 0) does not form a triangle  
(8, 5) forms a triangle with node 9: <8, 5, 9>  
(9, 5) forms a triangle with node 7: <9, 5, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 1>, <2, 7, 4>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 3, 7>, <8, 5, 9>, <9, 5, 7>.
