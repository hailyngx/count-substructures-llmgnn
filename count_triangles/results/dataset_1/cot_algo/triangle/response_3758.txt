Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 (degree 5) - relabeled as Node 3
Node 1 (degree 1) - relabeled as Node 0
Node 2 (degree 2) - relabeled as Node 1
Node 3 (degree 2) - relabeled as Node 2
Node 4 (degree 3) - relabeled as Node 4
Node 5 (degree 4) - relabeled as Node 5
Node 6 (degree 2) - relabeled as Node 6
Node 7 (degree 3) - relabeled as Node 7
Node 8 (degree 4) - relabeled as Node 8
Node 9 (degree 2) - relabeled as Node 9

Based on the above relabeling, the edges can now be represented as follows:
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7)
(0, 5) (1, 8) 
(2, 3) (2, 8)
(4, 5) (4, 8)
(5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9)
(6, 3) (6, 7)
(7, 3) (7, 9)
(8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4)
(9, 5) (9, 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles formed in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 4>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
