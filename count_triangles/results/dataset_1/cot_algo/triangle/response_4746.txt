Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 4 - 0 connections
Node 6 - 0 connections
Node 8 - 0 connections
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 0 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections

Based on the new labels, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
2. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <0, 7, 1>.
4. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 9, 2>.
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <1, 9, 0>.
8. Edge (2, 0): Node 2 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <2, 0, 9>.
9. Edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (5, 0): Node 5 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <5, 0, 9>.
12. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (5, 9): Node 5 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <5, 9, 0>.
14. Edge (7, 0): Node 7 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <7, 0, 1>.
15. Edge (7, 1): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (9, 0): Node 9 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 2, forming a triangle <9, 0, 2>.
19. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 and Node 1 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <9, 1, 0>.
20. Edge (9, 5): Node 9 and Node 5 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <9, 5, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
