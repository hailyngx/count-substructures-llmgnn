Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertex 1 has degree 1  
Vertex 5 has degree 1  
Vertex 8 has degree 2  
Vertex 3 has degree 3  
Vertex 4 has degree 3  
Vertex 2 has degree 4  
Vertex 9 has degree 4  
Vertex 6 has degree 4  
Vertex 7 has degree 6  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Taking the edges (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 8), we can find the following triangles:  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 6, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
