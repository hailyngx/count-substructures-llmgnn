Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be:
(0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 4) (4, 4) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 6)

Examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Vertices 0 and 2 share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle: <0, 2, 3>.
Vertices 0 and 2 share a connection with vertex 8 forming a triangle: <0, 2, 8>.
Vertices 0 and 2 share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle: <0, 2, 9>.
Vertices 1 and 4 share a connection with vertex 5 forming a triangle: <1, 4, 5>.
Vertices 1 and 4 share a connection with vertex 7 forming a triangle: <1, 4, 7>.
Vertices 2 and 3 share a connection with vertex 4 which forms a triangle: <2, 3, 4>.
Vertices 3 and 6 share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle: <3, 6, 9>.
Vertices 4 and 5 share a connection with vertex 1 forming a triangle: <4, 5, 1>.
Vertices 4 and 5 share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle: <4, 5, 9>.
Vertices 6 and 7 share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle: <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 1>, and <6, 7, 9>.
