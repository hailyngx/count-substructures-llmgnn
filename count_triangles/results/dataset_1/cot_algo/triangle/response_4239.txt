Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 2:  Degree 2
Node 6:  Degree 2
Node 9:  Degree 2
Node 3:  Degree 3
Node 5:  Degree 4
Node 8:  Degree 4
Node 1:  Degree 5
Node 7:  Degree 5
Node 4:  Degree 6
Node 0:  Degree 7

Using these labels, we will consider the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:

Considering edge (0, 1):
Node 0: [2, 4, 8]
Node 1: [4, 6, 7]
Shared connections: [4]
Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>

Considering edge (0, 2):
Node 0: [2, 4, 8]
Node 2: [4, 7, 9]
Shared connections: [4]
Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>

Considering edge (0, 4):
Node 0: [2, 4, 8]
Node 4: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Shared connections: [0, 2]
Triangles formed: <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>

Considering edge (0, 8):
Node 0: [2, 4, 8]
Node 8: [0, 3, 5, 9]
Shared connections: [0]
Triangle formed: <0, 8, 3>

Considering edge (1, 4):
Node 1: [4, 6, 7]
Node 4: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Shared connections: [1]
Triangle formed: <1, 4, 0>

Considering edge (2, 4):
Node 2: [4, 7, 9]
Node 4: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Shared connections: [2]
Triangle formed: <2, 4, 0>

As all other edges involve a higher labeled node with fewer connections, no more triangles can be formed.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. 
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 8, 3>, <1, 4, 0>, and <2, 4, 0>.
