Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we can relabel the nodes as follows:  

Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 2  
Node 6 has degree 1  
Node 7 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 4  
Node 3 has degree 5  
Node 0 has degree 6  

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge while following the rule that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Counting the triangles, we find:  

- Triangle 1: <0, 3, 7>  
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 9>  
- Triangle 3: <0, 6, 7>  
- Triangle 4: <0, 6, 9>  
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 9>  
- Triangle 6: <2, 4, 5>  

Total number of triangles: [6]
