Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections), the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Vertices: 7, 1, 0, 5, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 2

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method.

There are 14 triangles in the graph, listed below:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 5, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
