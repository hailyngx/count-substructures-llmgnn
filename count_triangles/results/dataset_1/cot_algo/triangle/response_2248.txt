Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (degree 3)
- Vertex 8 (degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 4)
- Vertex 5 (degree 5)
- Vertex 6 (degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 5, 6>
2. <0, 5, 8>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <0, 8, 3>
5. <7, 5, 6>
6. <1, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
