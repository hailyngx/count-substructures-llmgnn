Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 4 has 1 connection.
Nodes 3, 7, and 0 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 9 have 4 connections each.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 6 connections.

We will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Node 4 -> A
Nodes 3, 7, and 0 -> B, C, D
Nodes 5 and 6 -> E, F
Nodes 2 and 9 -> G, H
Node 8 -> I
Node 1 -> J

Now we will consider the edges in the order given and count the triangles:
(0, 1): D and J share 3, forming triangle <0, 1, 5>.
(0, 2): D and G share 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
(0, 5): D and E share 1, no triangle.
(1, 5): J and E share 0, no triangle.
(1, 6): J and F share 0, no triangle.
(1, 8): J and I share 1, no triangle.
(1, 9): J and H share 1, forming triangle <1, 9, 4>.
(2, 0): G and D share 0, no triangle.
(2, 3): G and B share 2, no triangle.
(2, 6): G and F share 2, forming triangle <2, 6, 8>.
(3, 2): B and G share 2, no triangle.
(4, 9): A and H share 1, no triangle.
(5, 0): E and D share 1, no triangle.
(5, 1): E and J share 0, no triangle.
(6, 1): F and J share 0, no triangle.
(6, 2): F and G share 2, forming triangle <6, 2, 8>.
(6, 8): F and I share 0, no triangle.
(7, 8): C and I share 0, no triangle.
(8, 1): I and J share 1, no triangle.
(8, 6): I and F share 2, no triangle.
(8, 7): I and C share 0, no triangle.
(8, 9): I and H share 1, no triangle.
(9, 1): H and J share 1, no triangle.
(9, 4): H and A share 1, no triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]

Triangles found:
