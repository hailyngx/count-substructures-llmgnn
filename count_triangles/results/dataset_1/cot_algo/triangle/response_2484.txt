Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees.  

Vertices sorted by degree:  
0 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 2)  
2 (degree 0)  
3 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 4)  
6 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 4)  
1 (degree 4)  
4 (degree 4)  
8 (degree 4)  

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order of degree.  
0 → 0  
5 → 1  
2 → 2  
3 → 3  
7 → 4  
6 → 5  
9 → 6  
1 → 7  
4 → 8  
8 → 9  

Now, we will check for triangles formed by the edges:
- Edge (0, 1): 0 and 1 have common connection with 8 (0 -> 8, 1 -> 8)
- Edge (0, 4): 0 and 4 have common connection with 8 (0 -> 8, 4 -> 8)
- Edge (0, 8): 0 and 8 have common connection with 4 (0 -> 4, 8 -> 4)
- Edge (1, 0): 1 and 0 have common connection with 8 (1 -> 8, 0 -> 8)
- Edge (1, 6): 1 and 6 have no common connection
- Edge (1, 8): 1 and 8 have common connection with 0 (1 -> 0, 8 -> 0)
- Edge (1, 9): 1 and 9 have no common connection
- Edge (3, 4): 3 and 4 have common connection with 8 (3 -> 8, 4 -> 8)
- Edge (3, 6): 3 and 6 have no common connection
- Edge (3, 8): 3 and 8 have common connection with 4 (3 -> 4, 8 -> 4)
- Edge (4, 0): 4 and 0 have common connection with 8 (4 -> 8, 0 -> 8)
- Edge (4, 3): 4 and 3 have common connection with 8 (4 -> 8, 3 -> 8)
- Edge (4, 7): 4 and 7 have common connection with 9 (4 -> 9, 7 -> 9)
- Edge (4, 9): 4 and 9 have common connection with 7 (4 -> 7, 9 -> 7)
- Edge (5, 7): 5 and 7 have no common connection
- Edge (6, 1): 6 and 1 have no common connection
- Edge (6, 3): 6 and 3 have no common connection
- Edge (6, 8): 6 and 8 have common connection with 1 (6 -> 1, 8 -> 1)
- Edge (7, 4): 7 and 4 have common connection with 9 (7 -> 9, 4 -> 9)
- Edge (7, 5): 7 and 5 have no common connection
- Edge (7, 9): 7 and 9 have common connection with 4 (7 -> 4, 9 -> 4)
- Edge (8, 0): 8 and 0 have common connection with 4 (8 -> 4, 0 -> 4)
- Edge (8, 1): 8 and 1 have common connection with 0 (8 -> 0, 1 -> 0)
- Edge (8, 3): 8 and 3 have common connection with 4 (8 -> 4, 3 -> 4)
- Edge (8, 6): 8 and 6 have common connection with 1 (8 -> 1, 6 -> 1)
- Edge (9, 1): 9 and 1 have no common connection
- Edge (9, 4): 9 and 4 have common connection with 7 (9 -> 7, 4 -> 7)
- Edge (9, 7): 9 and 7 have common connection with 4 (9 -> 4, 7 -> 4)
