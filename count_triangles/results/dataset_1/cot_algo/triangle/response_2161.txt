Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 6, 1, 9, 0, 7

Now, we will check each edge to count the number of triangles:
For edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 3, 6, 9.
Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 5.
Vertices 0 and 2 share vertex 5 as a common connection, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.

For edge (0, 3):
Vertices 0 and 3 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (0, 6):
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2, 3, 6, 9.
Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 0, 8.
Vertices 0 and 6 share vertex 8 as a common connection, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.

For edge (0, 9):
Vertices 0 and 9 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (1, 4):
Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 4, 5, 7.
Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 1, 7.
Vertices 1 and 4 share vertex 7 as a common connection, forming a triangle <1, 4, 7>.

For edge (1, 5):
Vertices 1 and 5 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (1, 7):
Vertices 1 and 7 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (2, 5):
Vertices 2 and 5 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (3, 5):
Vertices 3 and 5 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (6, 8):
Vertices 6 and 8 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (7, 4):
Vertices 4 and 7 do not form a triangle since their total connections are less than each other.

For edge (7, 9):
Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 1, 4, 9.
Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 0, 7.
Vertices 7 and 9 do not share enough connections to form a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, and <1, 4, 7>.
