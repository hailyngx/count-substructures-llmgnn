Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Vertices sorted based on the number of connections:
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 4 - 1 connection
Node 3 - 1 connection
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 5 connections
Node 6 - 6 connections
