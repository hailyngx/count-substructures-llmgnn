Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following vertices sorted based on their degree (number of connections): 7, 4, 0, 9, 2, 3, 10, 6, 1, 5.

By following the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Checking edge (0, 3): Shared connection with vertex 5. Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>
- Checking edge (0, 5): Shared connection with vertex 1. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 1>
- Checking edge (1, 3): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (1, 5): Shared connection with vertex 6. Triangle formed: <1, 5, 6>
- Checking edge (1, 6): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle formed: <1, 6, 8>
- Checking edge (3, 1): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (4, 5): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (5, 0): Shared connection with vertex 3. Triangle formed: <5, 0, 3>
- Checking edge (5, 1): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (5, 4): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (5, 6): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (6, 1): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (6, 5): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle formed: <6, 5, 8>
- Checking edge (6, 8): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (7, 8): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (8, 1): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (8, 6): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (8, 7): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (8, 9): No further triangles formed.
- Checking edge (9, 8): No further triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 1>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 8>, <6, 5, 8>
