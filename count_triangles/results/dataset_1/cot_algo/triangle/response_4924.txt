Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices with their respective degrees are:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2)
- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 2)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 3)
- Vertex 7 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (degree 5)
- Vertex 3 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now proceed to count the triangles. 

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
