Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
3, 4, 8, 9, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 0

The edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are:
(0, 7), (0, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (8, 7), (9, 0)

Counting the number of triangles:
1 triangle: <0, 2, 7>
1 triangle: <0, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles is [2].
