Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After reordering the nodes based on their degree, we get:  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we process the edges based on the order of the nodes:  
(5, 0) doesn't count.  
(9, 3) doesn't count.  
(5, 7) doesn't count.  
(3, 4) doesn't count.  
(6, 1) doesn't count.  
(7, 2) produces triangle [2, 7, 4].  
(5, 7) doesn't count.  
(7, 4) produces triangle [4, 7, 2].  
(1, 6) doesn't count.  
(7, 9) doesn't count.  
(0, 4) doesn't count.  
(2, 6) produces triangle [2, 6, 1].  
(6, 8) produces triangle [6, 8, 2].  
(1, 2) doesn't count.  
(2, 8) produces triangle [2, 6, 8].  
(0, 5) doesn't count.  
(6, 8) doesn't count.  
(4, 0) doesn't count.  
(7, 9) doesn't count.  
(0, 8) doesn't count.  
(4, 1) doesn't count.  
(1, 4) doesn't count.  
(8, 6) produces triangle [8, 6, 2].  
(0, 5) doesn't count.  
(4, 3) doesn't count.  
(2, 7) produces triangle [2, 7, 4].  
(8, 0) doesn't count.  
(3, 9) doesn't count.  
(7, 4) produces triangle [7, 4, 2].  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
The unique triangles found are <2, 7, 4>, <2, 6, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, and <8, 6, 2>.
