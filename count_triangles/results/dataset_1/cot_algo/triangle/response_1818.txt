Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 2 has 1 connection
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 3 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will go through each edge in the graph and check for shared connections to count the triangles. Calculating in this manner, we find that there are:
- 8 triangles in total

The unique triangles identified are:
- <1, 8, 9>
- <1, 8, 3>
- <1, 9, 5>
- <8, 2, 5>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 3, 1>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <9, 7, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
