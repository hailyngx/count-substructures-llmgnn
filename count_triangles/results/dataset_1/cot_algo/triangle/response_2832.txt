Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following ordering: 

Node 3 (Degree 2), Node 0 (Degree 3), Node 6 (Degree 3), Node 5 (Degree 3), Node 9 (Degree 3), Node 2 (Degree 4), Node 8 (Degree 4), Node 7 (Degree 4), Node 1 (Degree 5), Node 4 (Degree 5).

Now, we will go through each edge based on the degree-based ordering and count the triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 5.
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
Therefore, there is one triangle <0, 1, 5>.

For edge (0, 5):
Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 5.
Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
Therefore, there is one triangle <0, 1, 5>.

For edge (1, 4):
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
Node 4 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
Therefore, there is one triangle <1, 4, 8>.

For edge (1, 5):
Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
Therefore, there is one triangle <1, 5, 0>.

For edge (4, 1):
This edge was already considered above.

For edge (4, 8):
This edge was already considered above.

For edge (5, 0):
This edge was already considered above.

Now counting the total number of triangles we found: [2]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
