Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex order is: 7, 8, 5, 1, 9, 4, 6, 3, 0, 2.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges starting from the lowest labeled vertices with fewer connections.

Counting the triangles in the graph results in: [6]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 8>.
