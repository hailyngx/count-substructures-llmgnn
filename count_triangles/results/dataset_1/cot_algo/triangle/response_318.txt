Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 6
- Node 0: Degree 6

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

- Node 7: 0 (Degree 1)
- Node 9: 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 6: 2 (Degree 2)
- Node 2: 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 4: 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 5: 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 1: 6 (Degree 5)
- Node 3: 7 (Degree 5)
- Node 8: 8 (Degree 6)
- Node 0: 9 (Degree 6)

Next, we will identify the triangles by examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 1, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle <3, 4, 8>
- Triangle <3, 6, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [9].
