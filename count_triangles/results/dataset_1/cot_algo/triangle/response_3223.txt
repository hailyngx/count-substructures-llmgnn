Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is: <5, 1, 6, 0, 2, 4, 9, 3, 7, 8>.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles formed by shared connections between vertices. Counting the triangles results in 4 triangles. 

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
