Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 7 connections

Let's relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> A
Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> B
Vertex 2 (degree 4) -> C
Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> D
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> E
Vertex 5 (degree 4) -> F
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> G
Vertex 7 (degree 3) -> H
Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> I
Vertex 9 (degree 7) -> J

Now, we will go through the edges using the degree-based ordering method:
1. (B, G): No triangle formed.
2. (B, J): No triangle formed.
3. (C, G): Triangle formed: <C, G, J>.
4. (C, H): No triangle formed.
5. (C, I): No triangle formed.
6. (C, J): Triangle formed: <C, J, F>.
7. (D, A): No triangle formed.
8. (D, E): No triangle formed.
9. (D, G): Triangle formed: <D, G, A>.
10. (E, A): No triangle formed.
11. (E, D): Triangle formed: <E, D, G>.
12. (E, J): Triangle formed: <E, J, F>.
13. (F, A): No triangle formed.
14. (F, H): No triangle formed.
15. (F, I): No triangle formed.
16. (F, J): Triangle formed: <F, J, E>.
17. (G, B): No triangle formed.
18. (G, C): Triangle formed: <G, C, J>.
19. (G, D): Triangle formed: <G, D, A>.
20. (H, C): No triangle formed.
21. (H, F): No triangle formed.
22. (H, J): Triangle formed: <H, J, F>.
23. (I, C): No triangle formed.
24. (I, F): No triangle formed.
25. (I, J): No triangle formed.
26. (I, E): No triangle formed.
27. (J, A): No triangle formed.
28. (J, B): No triangle formed.
29. (J, C): Triangle formed: <J, C, G>.
30. (J, E): Triangle formed: <J, E, F>.
31. (J, F): Triangle formed: <J, F, H>.
32. (J, H): Triangle formed: <J, H, F>.
