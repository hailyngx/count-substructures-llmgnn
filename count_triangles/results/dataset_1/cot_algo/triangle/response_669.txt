Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections (degree) from least to most, we can relabel them as follows:
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 5

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For edge (0, 3):
  Node 0 has neighbors [3, 4, 8]
  Node 3 has neighbors [0]
  They share a connection at node 3 forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.

- For edge (0, 4):
  Node 0 has neighbors [3, 4, 8]
  Node 4 has neighbors [0, 5]
  They share a connection at node 4 forming a triangle <0, 4, 5>.

- For edge (0, 8):
  Node 0 has neighbors [3, 4, 8]
  Node 8 has neighbors [0, 5, 6, 7]
  They share a connection at node 8 forming a triangle <0, 8, 5>.

- For edge (1, 5):
  Node 1 has neighbors [5, 7, 9]
  Node 5 has neighbors [1, 4, 7, 8]
  They share a connection at node 5 forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.

- For edge (1, 7):
  Node 1 has neighbors [5, 7, 9]
  Node 7 has neighbors [1, 5, 6, 8, 9]
  They share a connection at node 7 forming a triangle <1, 7, 5>.

- For edge (1, 9):
  Node 1 has neighbors [5, 7, 9]
  Node 9 has neighbors [1, 6, 7]
  They share a connection at node 9 forming a triangle <1, 9, 7>.

- For edge (2, 6):
  Node 2 has neighbors [6]
  Node 6 has neighbors [2, 7, 8, 9]
  They share a connection at node 6 forming a triangle <2, 6, 7>.

- For edge (4, 5):
  Node 4 has neighbors [0, 5]
  Node 5 has neighbors [1, 4, 7, 8]
  They share a connection at node 5 forming a triangle <4, 5, 1>.

- For edge (6, 7):
  Node 6 has neighbors [2, 7, 8, 9]
  Node 7 has neighbors [1, 5, 6, 8, 9]
  They share a connection at node 7 forming a triangle <6, 7, 8>.

- For edge (6, 8):
  Node 6 has neighbors [2, 7, 8, 9]
  Node 8 has neighbors [0, 5, 6, 7]
  They share a connection at node 8 forming a triangle <6, 8, 7>.

- For edge (6, 9):
  Node 6 has neighbors [2, 7, 8, 9]
  Node 9 has neighbors [1, 6, 7]
  They share a connection at node 6 forming a triangle <6, 9, 7>.

- For edge (7, 9):
  Node 7 has neighbors [1, 5, 6, 8, 9]
  Node 9 has neighbors [1, 6, 7]
  They share a connection at node 9 forming a triangle <7, 9, 1>.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [11].
