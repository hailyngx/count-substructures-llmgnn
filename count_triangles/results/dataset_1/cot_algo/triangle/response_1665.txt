Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices in ascending order based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 8: 1 connection
Nodes 1: 4 connections
Nodes 2, 9: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

For edge (0, 2): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 9). Triangle formed: <0, 2, 9>.
For edge (0, 7): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 9). Triangle formed: <0, 7, 9>.
For edge (0, 9): Node 0 has no common connection with node 9.
For edge (1, 3): Both nodes have no common connections.
For edge (1, 5): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 7). Triangle formed: <1, 5, 7>.
For edge (1, 6): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 7). Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>.
For edge (1, 9): Both nodes have 2 common connections (nodes 0 and 2). Triangles formed: <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 2>.
For edge (2, 0): Node 2 has 1 common connection with node 0. Triangle formed: <2, 0, 9>.
For edge (2, 9): Node 2 has no common connection with node 9.
For edge (3, 1): Both nodes have no common connections.
For edge (3, 7): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 0). Triangle formed: <3, 7, 0>.
For edge (4, 8): Both nodes have no common connections.
For edge (5, 1): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 7). Triangle formed: <5, 1, 7>.
For edge (5, 7): Both nodes have no common connections.
For edge (6, 1): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 7). Triangle formed: <6, 1, 7>.
For edge (6, 7): Node 6 has no common connection with node 7.
For edge (7, 0): Node 7 has 1 common connection with node 0. Triangle formed: <7, 0, 9>.
For edge (7, 3): Node 7 has 1 common connection with node 3. Triangle formed: <7, 3, 0>.
For edge (7, 5): Both nodes have 1 common connection (node 1). Triangle formed: <7, 5, 1>.
For edge (7, 6): Node 7 has no common connection with node 6.
For edge (7, 8): Node 7 has 1 common connection with node 8. Triangle formed: <7, 8, 4>.
For edge (8, 4): Both nodes have no common connections.
For edge (8, 7): Node 8 has 1 common connection with node 7. Triangle formed: <8, 7, 0>.
For edge (8, 9): Node 8 has no common connection with node 9.
For edge (9, 0): Node 9 has no common connection with node 0.
For edge (9, 1): Node 9 has 2 common connections with node 1. Triangles formed: <9, 1, 0>, <9, 1, 2>.
For edge (9, 2): Node 9 has no common connection with node 2.
For edge (9, 8): Node 9 has no common connection with node 8.

Overall, the total number of triangles is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 9, 0>, <1, 9, 2>, <3, 7, 0>, <7, 8, 4>.
