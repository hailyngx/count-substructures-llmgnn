Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly. Below is the sorted list of vertices based on degree:

Nodes and their connections:
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph:
Triangles: [29]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>
