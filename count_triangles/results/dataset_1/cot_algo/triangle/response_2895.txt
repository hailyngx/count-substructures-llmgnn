Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
7: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
2: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
1: 6 connections
9: 6 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method by examining each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label and counting the triangles:

Triangles:
[9, 1, 2]
[9, 1, 4]
[9, 1, 7]
[9, 1, 6]
[9, 2, 6]
[1, 4, 6]
[1, 6, 7]
[1, 6, 9]
[3, 4, 6]
[6, 7, 9]

Total number of triangles: [10]
