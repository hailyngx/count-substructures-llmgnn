Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 4)

Examining the edges based on the new labels, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
