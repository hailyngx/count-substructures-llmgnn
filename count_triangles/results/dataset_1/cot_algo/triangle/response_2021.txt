Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows: 

Node 5: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

- For edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 share connections with Node 2, form triangle <0, 2, 3>.
- For edge (0, 6): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 0 has more connections than Node 6.
- For edge (0, 8): Node 0 and Node 8 share connections with Node 1, form triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 1 has more connections than Node 6.
- For edge (1, 8): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 1 has more connections than Node 8.
- For edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 2 has more connections than Node 3.
- For edge (2, 4): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 2 has more connections than Node 4.
- For edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 share connections with Node 6, form triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- For edge (3, 0): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 3 has more connections than Node 0.
- For edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 3 has more connections than Node 2.
- For edge (4, 2): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 4 has more connections than Node 2.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 5 has more connections than Node 6.
- For edge (6, 0): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 6 has more connections than Node 0.
- For edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 6 has more connections than Node 1.
- For edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 6 has more connections than Node 5.
- For edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 share connections with Node 2, form triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- For edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 7 has more connections than Node 9.
- For edge (8, 0): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 8 has more connections than Node 0.
- For edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 8 has more connections than Node 1.
- For edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 share connections with Node 6, form triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- For edge (9, 2): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 9 has more connections than Node 2.
- For edge (9, 6): Node 9 and Node 6 share connections with Node 2, form triangle <2, 6, 9>.
- For edge (9, 7): No triangles can be formed following the method as Node 9 has more connections than Node 7.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <2, 6, 9>. 

The answer is [3].
