Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

Degree of each node:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Sort vertices by degree:
Order: 5, 9, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1

Now, we will proceed with the edges based on this ordering:

Edge (5, 8): Node 5 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
Edge (9, 1): Node 9 and Node 1 do not form a triangle.
Edge (3, 0): Node 3 and Node 0 do not form a triangle.
Edge (4, 0): Node 4 and Node 0 do not form a triangle.
Edge (6, 0): Node 6 and Node 0 form a triangle with shared connection 3.
Edge (7, 1): Node 7 and Node 1 do not form a triangle.
Edge (8, 5): Node 8 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
Edge (8, 6): Node 8 and Node 6 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
Edge (8, 7): Node 8 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 form a triangle with shared connection 3.
Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 form a triangle with shared connection 1.
Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and Node 6 form a triangle with shared connection 8.
Edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 form a triangle with shared connection 0.
Edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
Edge (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 do not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>
