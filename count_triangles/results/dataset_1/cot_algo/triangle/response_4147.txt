Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree. In this case, the degrees of the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 2: 0
- Vertex 4: 1
- Vertex 5: 2
- Vertex 1: 3
- Vertex 7: 4
- Vertex 6: 5
- Vertex 8: 6
- Vertex 9: 7
- Vertex 3: 8
- Vertex 0: 9

Now, we only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Consider edge (2, 4):
    - Shared connections with vertex 1: 5
    - Triangle found: <0, 2, 4>
- Consider edge (2, 5):
    - Shared connections with vertex 2: None
- Consider edge (4, 5):
    - Shared connections with vertex 2: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 1, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>. Thus, the output is [1].
