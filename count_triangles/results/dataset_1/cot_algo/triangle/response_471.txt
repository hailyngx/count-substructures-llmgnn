Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: 7, 9, 1, 2, 0, 4, 6, 3, 8, 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges as follows:
1. (0, 5): Check for common neighbors -> 7
2. (0, 7): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
3. (1, 2): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
4. (1, 5): Check for common neighbors -> 3
5. (2, 1): No action (vertex with lower label has fewer connections)
6. (3, 5): Check for common neighbors -> 8
7. (3, 6): Check for common neighbors -> 4
8. (3, 8): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
9. (4, 6): Check for common neighbors -> 8
10. (4, 8): Check for common neighbors -> 6
11. (5, 0): Check for common neighbors -> 7
12. (5, 1): Check for common neighbors -> 3
13. (5, 3): Check for common neighbors -> 6, 8, 9
14. (5, 8): Check for common neighbors -> 6
15. (5, 9): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
16. (6, 3): Check for common neighbors -> 4
17. (6, 4): Check for common neighbors -> 8
18. (6, 8): Check for common neighbors -> 4
19. (7, 0): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
20. (8, 3): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
21. (8, 4): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)
22. (8, 5): Check for common neighbors -> 6
23. (8, 6): Check for common neighbors -> 4
24. (9, 5): No action (vertex with lower label has more connections)

There are a total of 9 triangles in the graph:
