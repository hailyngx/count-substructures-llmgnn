Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes: 5, 7, 9
Nodes: 2, 3, 7
Node: 4
Nodes: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degree:
Node 5, Node 7, Node 9
Node 2, Node 3, Node 7
Node 4
Node 1, Node 6, Node 8

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. For edge (1, 2): Node 1 has connections with Node 3 and Node 4. No triangles formed.
2. For edge (1, 3): Node 1 has a connection with Node 4. No triangles formed.
3. For edge (1, 4): Node 1 has a connection with Node 3. No triangles formed.
4. For edge (1, 8): Node 1 has a connection with Node 9. No triangles formed.
5. For edge (2, 6): Node 2 has a connection with Node 3. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
6. For edge (3, 6): Node 3 has a connection with Node 2. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>.
7. For edge (4, 7): Node 4 has a connection with Node 7. No triangles formed.
8. For edge(5, 6): No triangles formed.
9. For edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.

Count of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 6>
