Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's assign degrees to each node:  
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 5  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 4  
Node 4 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 7 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 4  
Node 9 has degree 1  

Now, let's relabel the nodes in increasing order of their degrees:  
Node 9 → 0  
Node 2 → 1  
Node 6 → 2  
Node 4 → 3  
Node 8 → 4  
Node 3 → 5  
Node 7 → 6  
Node 0 → 7  
Node 1 → 8  

Using the degree-based ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(9, 8)  
(2, 1)  
(6, 4)  
(4, 3)  
(8, 3)  
(3, 5)  
(7, 6)  
(0, 7)  
(1, 8)  
(1, 4)  
(1, 6)  
(1, 7)  
(2, 3)  
(2, 7)  
(3, 7)  
(3, 8)  
(4, 6)  

By following the degree-based ordering and counting triangles, we find that there are:
Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:  
<1, 4, 6>  
<1, 3, 5>  
<1, 6, 4>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 7, 8>
