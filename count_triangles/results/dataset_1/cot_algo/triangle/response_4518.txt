Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 1: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we can now analyze the edges based on the new vertex labels to count the number of triangles.

Count of triangles: 3

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 4>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [3].
