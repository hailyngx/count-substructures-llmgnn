Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list of vertices based on their degree (number of connections) is as follows:

Vertex 3: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 2 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  
Vertex 1: 4 connections  
Vertex 2: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 0: 5 connections  
Vertex 9: 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges following the rule that only the edge between the vertex with the lower label and fewer connections will be considered. Analyzing the edges based on this rule:

(0, 1) - Both have 4 connections, skip  
(0, 2) - 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>  
(0, 8) - 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>  
(0, 9) - 0 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <0, 9, 3>  
(1, 8) - 1 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <1, 0, 8>  
(1, 9) - 1 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <1, 9, 3>  
(2, 8) - 2 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <2, 0, 8>  
(3, 7) - Both have 4 connections, skip  
(3, 9) - 3 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <3, 9, 5>  
(4, 7) - Both have 4 connections, skip  
(5, 7) - 5 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <5, 7, 9>  
(6, 7) - 6 has 2 connections, skip  
(7, 3) - 3 has fewer connections, check shared connections  
Triangle found: <7, 9, 3>  

Counting the total number of triangles gives us 5 triangles in total, which are:

<0, 2, 8>, <0, 9, 3>, <1, 0, 8>, <1, 9, 3>, <5, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets [] is [5].
