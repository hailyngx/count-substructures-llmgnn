Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their degrees in ascending order:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2
Node 7: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6

Now we will start counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- For the edge (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 1, 5, 6
  Triangle: <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>

- For the edge (0, 6): 0 has degree 4 and 6 has degree 6, proceed.
  Shared connections: 1, 5
  Triangle: <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 5>

- For the edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 6
  Triangle: <0, 8, 6>

- For the edge (1, 2): Both 1 and 2 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 5
  Triangle: <1, 2, 5>

- For the edge (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 2
  Triangle: <1, 5, 2>

- For the edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 0, 5
  Triangle: <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 5>

- For the edge (2, 5): Both 2 and 5 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 1
  Triangle: <2, 5, 1>

- For the edge (3, 7): Both 3 and 7 have degrees less than 4, we skip this edge.

- For the edge (3, 8): 3 has degree 1 and 8 has degree 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 6
  Triangle: <3, 8, 6>

- For the edge (4, 8): Both 4 and 8 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 9
  Triangle: <4, 8, 9>

- For the edge (4, 9): Both 4 and 9 have a degree of 1, we skip this edge.

- For the edge (5, 6): Both 5 and 6 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 0, 1
  Triangle: <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 1>

- For the edge (5, 9): Both 5 and 9 have a degree less than 4, we skip this edge.

- For the edge (6, 7): Both 6 and 7 have degrees less than 4, we skip this edge.

- For the edge (6, 8): 6 has degree 6 and 8 has degree 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 0
  Triangle: <6, 8, 0>

- For the edge (7, 8): Both 7 and 8 have a degree of 4, proceed.
  Shared connections: 6
  Triangle: <7, 8, 6>

The total number of triangles is [9] and the unique triangles are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 6>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 5, 2>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 6, 5>, <2, 5, 1>, <3, 8, 6>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 6, 0>, <5, 6, 1>, <6, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 6>.
