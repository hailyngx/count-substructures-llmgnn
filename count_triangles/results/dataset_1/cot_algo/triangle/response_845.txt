Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the vertices by their degree:

- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 7 connections
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 6 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 1's 7 connections. No triangle.
2. Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 5's 6 connections. A triangle is formed: <0, 1, 5>.
3. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 7 connections, more than vertex 2's 3 connections. No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 7 connections, more than vertex 3's 3 connections. A triangle is formed: <1, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has 7 connections, more than vertex 4's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <1, 3, 4>.
6. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has 7 connections, more than vertex 5's 6 connections. A triangle is formed: <1, 0, 5>.
7. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has 7 connections, more than vertex 7's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <1, 7, 9>.
8. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has 3 connections, fewer than vertex 5's 6 connections. No triangle.
9. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has 3 connections, fewer than vertex 7's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <2, 1, 7>.
10. Edge (3, 1): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, fewer than vertex 1's 7 connections. A triangle is formed: <3, 1, 0>.
11. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has 3 connections, fewer than vertex 4's 4 connections. No triangle.

13. Edge (4, 1): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, more than vertex 1's 7 connections. No triangle.
14. Edge (4, 3): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, more than vertex 3's 3 connections. No triangle.
15. Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 has 4 connections, fewer than vertex 5's 6 connections. No triangle.
16. Edge (5, 0): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 0's 2 connections. No triangle.
17. Edge (5, 1): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 1's 7 connections. No triangle.
18. Edge (5, 2): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 2's 3 connections. No triangle.
19. Edge (5, 4): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 4's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <5, 1, 3>.
20. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 7's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <5, 1, 7>.
21. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has 6 connections, more than vertex 9's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <5, 7, 9>.
22. Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 8's 2 connections. No triangle.
23. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 9's 4 connections. No triangle.
24. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, more than vertex 1's 7 connections. No triangle.
25. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, more than vertex 2's 3 connections. A triangle is formed: <7, 1, 2>.
26. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, more than vertex 5's 6 connections. A triangle is formed: <7, 1, 5>.
27. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has 4 connections, more than vertex 9's 4 connections. A triangle is formed: <7, 1, 5>.
28. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 8 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 3's 3 connections. No triangle.
29. Edge (8, 6): Vertex 8 has 2 connections, fewer than vertex 6's 2 connections. No triangle.
30. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, more than vertex 5's 6 connections. No triangle.
31. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, more than vertex 6's 2 connections. No triangle.
32. Edge (9, 7): Vertex 9 has 4 connections, more than vertex 7's 4 connections. No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 1, 7>
- <3, 1, 0>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 7, 9>
