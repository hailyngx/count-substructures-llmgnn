Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 0
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <2, 4, 7>
4. <2, 5, 7>
5. <4, 5, 7>
6. <4, 7, 8>
7. <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
