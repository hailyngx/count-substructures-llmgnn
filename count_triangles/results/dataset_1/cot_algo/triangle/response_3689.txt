Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method implies rearranging the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
1. Vertex 1: 2 connections
2. Vertex 3: 2 connections
3. Vertex 5: 2 connections
4. Vertex 8: 2 connections
5. Vertex 6: 3 connections
6. Vertex 7: 4 connections
7. Vertex 4: 5 connections
8. Vertex 9: 5 connections
9. Vertex 2: 5 connections
10. Vertex 0: 6 connections

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 0: Skip.

2. Edge (0, 4):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 0: Skip.

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 0.
   - Shared connections with vertex 8: 7
   - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 8>

4. Edge (0, 9):
   - Vertex 9 has fewer connections than vertex 0.
   - Shared connections with vertex 9: 1, 4, 6
   - Triangles formed: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 9>

5. Edge (1, 3):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 1: Skip.

6. Edge (1, 7):
   - Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1: Skip.

7. Edge (1, 9):
   - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 1: Skip.

8. Edge (2, 4):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 2: Skip.

9. Edge (2, 7):
   - Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 2: Skip.

10. Edge (3, 5):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 3: Skip.

11. Edge (4, 9):
   - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 4: Skip.

12. Edge (5, 6):
   - Both vertices have more connections than vertex 5: Skip.

13. Edge (6, 7):
   - Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 6: Skip.

14. Edge (6, 9):
   - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 6: Skip.

15. Edge (7, 8):
   - Vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 7: Skip.

Now, counting the total number of triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [4]
