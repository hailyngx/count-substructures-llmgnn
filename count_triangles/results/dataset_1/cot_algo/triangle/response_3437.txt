Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections each vertex has. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by following the method described in the introduction: 
1. Start with the edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 < Vertex 3, they share 1 common connection (Vertex 9), form a triangle <0, 3, 9>.
2. Move to the next edge: (0, 9): Vertex 0 < Vertex 9, they share 1 common connection (Vertex 3), form a triangle <0, 9, 3>.
3. Continue this process for all edges. 

After examining all edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 9, 3>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 3>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 7, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
