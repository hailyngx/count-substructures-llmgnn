Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 0 (Degree: 3)
- Node 1 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5 (Degree: 3)
- Node 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 4 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6 (Degree: 5)
- Node 3 (Degree: 5)
- Node 8 (Degree: 5)
- Node 2 (Degree: 6)

Calculating the triangles by checking shared connections between vertices while considering the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find:
- Total number of triangles: [9]
- Unique triangles found: 
    - <0, 1, 2>
    - <0, 2, 7>
    - <0, 2, 8>
    - <1, 2, 6>
    - <1, 2, 7>
    - <1, 2, 8>
    - <2, 3, 6>
    - <2, 6, 7>
    - <2, 6, 8>
