Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling for the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now examine the edges to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 7>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 3, 5>
5. <0, 4, 5>
6. <1, 4, 8>
7. <1, 7, 9>
8. <3, 4, 8>
9. <3, 5, 7>
10. <3, 5, 8>
11. <4, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [11]
