Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their connections are: 

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and the condition that the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections, we can identify the triangles:

- Vertex 0, 4, 9 form a triangle <0, 4, 9> as they share connections.
- Vertex 3, 4, 9 form a triangle <3, 4, 9> as they share connections.
- Vertex 3, 6, 9 form a triangle <3, 6, 9> as they share connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
