Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree of connections, we have the following order: 

Vertices: 3, 4, 8, 9, 0, 1, 7, 2, 5, 6

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [6]
