Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

We will relabel the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:
- Node 5 -> Node 0
- Node 1 -> Node 1
- Node 7 -> Node 2
- Node 0 -> Node 3
- Node 2 -> Node 4
- Node 3 -> Node 5
- Node 8 -> Node 6
- Node 4 -> Node 7
- Node 6 -> Node 8
- Node 9 -> Node 9

Now, let's identify the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>
- Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
