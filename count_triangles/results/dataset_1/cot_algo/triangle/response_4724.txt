Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will arrange the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2

Now, we will check edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 2) - Both vertices have more connections than the other, so we skip this edge.
(1, 6) - Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 6.
(2, 1) - Both vertices have more connections than the other, so we skip this edge.
(2, 9) - Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
(3, 9) - Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
(6, 1) - Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 1.
(6, 9) - Vertex 6 has fewer connections than vertex 9.
(7, 8) - Both vertices have more connections than the other, so we skip this edge.
(8, 7) - Both vertices have more connections than the other, so we skip this edge.
(9, 2) - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 2.
(9, 3) - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 3.
(9, 6) - Vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 6.

Now, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:
Triangles: <1, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 2>

So, the total number of triangles is [2].
