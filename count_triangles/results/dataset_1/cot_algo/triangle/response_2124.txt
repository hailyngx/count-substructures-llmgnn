Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 2 has degree 0.
- Nodes 4 and 5 have degree 1.
- Nodes 8 and 9 have degree 2.
- Nodes 3 and 6 have degree 3.
- Nodes 0 and 7 have degree 4.
- Node 1 has degree 3.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 2 (degree 0) -> Node 0
- Node 4 (degree 1) -> Node 1
- Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 2
- Node 8 (degree 2) -> Node 3
- Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 4
- Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node 5
- Node 6 (degree 3) -> Node 6
- Node 0 (degree 4) -> Node 7
- Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 8
- Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 9

Now, we will list the edges with the lower labeled vertex first:
- (1, 0) -> (1, 0)
- (4, 7) -> (1, 8)
- (0, 5) -> (0, 2)
- (6, 8) -> (6, 3)
- (6, 0) -> (6, 7)
- (6, 0) -> (6, 7)
- (7, 3) -> (8, 5)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by each edge:
- (1, 0) forms a triangle with node 3: <1, 0, 3>
- (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
- (0, 2) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 3) does not form a triangle.
- (6, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle found is <1, 0, 3>.
