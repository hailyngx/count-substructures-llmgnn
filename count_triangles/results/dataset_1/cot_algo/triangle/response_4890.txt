Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 6 has degree 0.
Vertices 1, 9, and 7 have degree 1.
Vertices 4 and 8 have degree 2.
Vertices 2 and 5 have degree 3.
Vertices 0 and 3 have degree 4.

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 6 -> 0
Vertices 1, 9, and 7 -> 1
Vertices 4 and 8 -> 2
Vertices 2 and 5 -> 3
Vertices 0 and 3 -> 4

Since we are only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 8) (4, 5) 

Now, we will check for shared connections to count the triangles:

Shared connections to form triangles:
- Vertex 0 (connection with 3, 5, 7, 9)
- Vertex 1 (connection with 4, 2)
- Vertex 2 (connection with 3)
- Vertex 3 (connection with 8)
- Vertex 4 (connection with 5)

So, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 2>
