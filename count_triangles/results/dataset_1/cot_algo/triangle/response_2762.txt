Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Node 3 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 6 and 2 both have 1 connection.
- Nodes 5, 8, and 9 all have 2 connections.
- Nodes 1 and 4 both have 3 connections.
- Node 0 has 4 connections.

Considering the edges in the graph, we can now find the triangles:

1. Triangle <3, 4, 9>
2. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
