Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their corresponding number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Next, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:
- Vertex 4, 7, 8, 1, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 0

Now, we relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 4: 0
- Vertex 7: 1
- Vertex 8: 2
- Vertex 1: 3
- Vertex 2: 4
- Vertex 5: 5
- Vertex 3: 6
- Vertex 9: 7
- Vertex 6: 8
- Vertex 0: 9

Now, we go through the edges considering the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Edge (4, 0), forms a triangle with vertex 3: <3, 0, 4>
- Edge (7, 5), does not result in a triangle since both vertices have equal labels.
- Edge (8, 3), does not result in a triangle since the higher labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (1, 6), does not result in a triangle since the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (2, 6), does not result in a triangle since the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (5, 7), does not result in a triangle since the higher labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (3, 0), forms a triangle with vertex 4: <4, 0, 3>
- Edge (9, 0), forms a triangle with vertex 2: <2, 0, 9>
- Edge (6, 0), forms a triangle with vertex 1: <1, 0, 6>
- Edge (6, 1), does not result in a triangle since both vertices have equal labels.
- Edge (6, 2), does not result in a triangle since the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (9, 2), does not result in a triangle since the lower labeled vertex has more connections.
- Edge (0, 3), forms a triangle with vertex 2: <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (0, 5), forms a triangle with vertex 8: <0, 5, 6>
- Edge (0, 6), forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 6, 1>
- Edge (0, 9), forms a triangle with vertex 1: <0, 9, 2>
- Edge (3, 4), does not result in a triangle since both vertices have equal labels.
- Edge (3, 8), does not result in a triangle since the higher labeled vertex has more connections.
