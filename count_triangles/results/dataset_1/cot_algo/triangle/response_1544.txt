Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 6 is not connected to any other vertex.

Vertices sorted by their degrees:
6 (degree: 0)
9 (degree: 1)
2 (degree: 1)
5 (degree: 2)
8 (degree: 3)
3 (degree: 4)
1 (degree: 4)
7 (degree: 4)
4 (degree: 5)
0 (degree: 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 in descending order of their degrees:

Vertex 6 -> relabeled as 9
Vertex 9 -> relabeled as 8
Vertex 2 -> relabeled as 7
Vertex 5 -> relabeled as 6
Vertex 8 -> relabeled as 5
Vertex 3 -> relabeled as 4
Vertex 1 -> relabeled as 3
Vertex 7 -> relabeled as 2
Vertex 4 -> relabeled as 1
Vertex 0 -> relabeled as 0

Now, let's count the number of triangles based on the given edges:

Triangles: 
[6]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
