Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 1

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 7: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 5: 3
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 8
Node 8: 9
Node 6: 10

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 3, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
