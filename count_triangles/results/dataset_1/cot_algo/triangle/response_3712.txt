Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:  

Node 1: 7 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 8: 1 connection  

Now, let's go through the edges considering the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2  
Edge (0, 6):  
Edge (0, 7):  
Edge (0, 8):  
Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2  
Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5  
Edge (2, 0):  
Edge (2, 1):  
Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9  
Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5  
Edge (2, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3  
Edge (3, 2):  
Edge (3, 6):  
Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 2  
Edge (4, 5):  
Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with shared connection 9  
Edge (5, 1):  
Edge (5, 2):  
Edge (5, 4):  
Edge (6, 0):  
Edge (6, 3):  
Edge (7, 0):  
Edge (8, 0):  
Edge (9, 2):  
Edge (9, 3):  
Edge (9, 4):  

Total number of triangles: [4]
