Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 4 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 2, and 8 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 7 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
1. (0, 1) (Shared connections: 7) Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
2. (0, 5) (Shared connections: None)
3. (0, 7) (Shared connections: 1) Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
4. (1, 7) (Shared connections: 0) Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
5. (1, 8) (Shared connections: None)
6. (1, 9) (Shared connections: None)
7. (2, 5) (Shared connections: None)
8. (2, 9) (Shared connections: None)
9. (3, 7) (Shared connections: None)
10. (4, 6) (Shared connections: None)
11. (5, 8) (Shared connections: None)
12. (5, 9) (Shared connections: None)
13. (6, 7) (Shared connections: None)
14. (7, 8) (Shared connections: 1) Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
15. (7, 9) (Shared connections: 1) Triangle: <0, 1, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>.
