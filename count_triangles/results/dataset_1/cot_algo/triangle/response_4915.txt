Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 7 (0 connections): 9
Node 0 (1 connection): 4
Node 2 (1 connection): 8
Node 4 (2 connections): 6
Node 6 (2 connections): 1
Node 1 (4 connections): 3
Node 5 (4 connections): 5
Node 3 (5 connections): 0
Node 8 (5 connections): 2
Node 9 (1 connection): 7

Now, let's calculate the triangles in the graph:
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 5>
3. <0, 3, 5>
4. <1, 3, 5>
5. <1, 5, 8>
6. <1, 6, 8>
7. <3, 5, 8>
8. <4, 8, 9>
9. <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
