Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method approach for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

1. List the vertices in ascending order of their degree:
   1. Vertex 1 (1 connection)
   2. Vertex 7 (2 connections)
   3. Vertex 0 (2 connections)
   4. Vertex 4 (2 connections)
   5. Vertex 3 (3 connections)
   6. Vertex 8 (0 connections)
   7. Vertex 5 (0 connections)
   8. Vertex 2 (4 connections)
   9. Vertex 6 (4 connections)
   10. Vertex 9 (6 connections)

2. Relabel the vertices:
   - Vertex 1 -> A (1 connection)
   - Vertex 7 -> B (2 connections)
   - Vertex 0 -> C (2 connections)
   - Vertex 4 -> D (2 connections)
   - Vertex 3 -> E (3 connections)
   - Vertex 8 -> F (0 connections)
   - Vertex 5 -> G (0 connections)
   - Vertex 2 -> H (4 connections)
   - Vertex 6 -> I (4 connections)
   - Vertex 9 -> J (6 connections)
   
3. Check the edges based on the labels:
   - (A, B) and (A, C) cannot form triangles.
   - (D, H) can form a triangle with shared connection at Vertex 4: <D, H, I>
   - (D, B) cannot form triangles.
   - (H, G) and (H, E) cannot form triangles.
   - (I, H) and (I, E) cannot form triangles.
   - (I, J) can form a triangle with shared connections at Vertex 9: <I, J, H>
   - (H, C) cannot form triangles.
   - (J, A) cannot form triangles.
   - (J, H), (J, E), and (J, I) can form triangles with shared connections at Vertex 9: <J, H, E> and <J, I, E> 

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <D, H, I>, <I, J, H>, <J, H, E>, <J, I, E>
