Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:

Node degrees:
0: 5
1: 3
2: 2
3: 2
4: 4
5: 2
6: 4
7: 2
8: 3
9: 3

Sorted nodes:
2, 3, 7, 5, 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 0

Performing the analysis:

1. Edge (2, 0):
   Nodes 2 and 0 share a connection with node 7 forming the triangle <0, 2, 7>.

2. Edge (3, 0):
   Nodes 3 and 0 do not form a triangle.

3. Edge (7, 2):
   Nodes 7 and 2 do not form a triangle.

4. Edge (5, 4):
   Nodes 5 and 4 do not form a triangle.

5. Edge (1, 0):
   Nodes 1 and 0 form a triangle with node 6, resulting in <0, 1, 6>.

6. Edge (8, 1):
   Nodes 8 and 1 do not form a triangle.

7. Edge (9, 7):
   Nodes 9 and 7 do not form a triangle.

8. Edge (6, 3):
   Nodes 6 and 3 do not form a triangle.

9. Edge (4, 0):
   Nodes 4 and 0 form triangles with nodes 6 and 1, resulting in <0, 4, 6> and <0, 1, 4>.

10. Edge (0, 1):
   This edge was already considered in step 5.

11. Edge (8, 5):
   Nodes 8 and 5 do not form a triangle.

12. Edge (9, 6):
   Nodes 9 and 6 form a triangle with node 4, resulting in <4, 6, 9>.

13. Edge (0, 2):
   This edge was already considered in step 1.

14. Edge (4, 1):
   This edge was already considered in step 5.

15. Edge (6, 8):
   Node 6 forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 4, resulting in <4, 6, 8>.

16. Edge (0, 3):
   This edge was already considered in step 2.

17. Edge (6, 9):
   This edge was already considered in step 12.

18. Edge (4, 9):
   This edge was already considered in step 12.

19. Edge (1, 4):
   This edge was already considered in step 5.

20. Edge (0, 6):
   Nodes 0 and 6 form triangles with nodes 2 and 4, resulting in <0, 2, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.

21. Edge (5, 8):
   Nodes 5 and 8 do not form a triangle.

22. Edge (9, 4):
   This edge was already considered in steps 12 and 18.

The total number of triangles is 7 inside brackets [].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, and <0, 2, 6>.
