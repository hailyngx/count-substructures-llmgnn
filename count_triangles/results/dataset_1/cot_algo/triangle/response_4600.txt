Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree from least to most connected, the new ordering is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 0, 8, 9, 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we can identify the following unique triangles: 
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
