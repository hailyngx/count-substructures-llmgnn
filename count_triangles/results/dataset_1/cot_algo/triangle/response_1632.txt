Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
With the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are as follows:
Node 3, 4, 7 have 3 connections.
Node 1, 5 have 4 connections.
Node 8, 9 have 5 connections.
Node 0, 2, 6 have 6 connections.
