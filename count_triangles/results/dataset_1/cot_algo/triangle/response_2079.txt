Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 7, 0, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 9, 5, 8.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
