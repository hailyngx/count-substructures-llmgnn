Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices along with their connections in increasing order:

0: 2, 7
3: 1
4: 8, 9
5: 8, 9
6: 1, 2
7: 0, 1
1: 3, 6, 7, 9
8: 4, 5
9: 1, 4, 5

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (8, 4): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (9, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
20. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <1, 4, 9>.
