Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following relabeling:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3 
Node 4: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 1
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles. Starting with edges involving nodes with the lowest degree:
- (4, 3) and (8, 3) - no triangles
- (7, 0) and (6, 7) - no triangles
- (6, 9) and (9, 5) - Triangle <5,6,9>

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique triangles found are <5,6,9>.
