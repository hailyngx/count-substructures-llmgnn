Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels will be:
Vertex 0 has degree 1.
Vertex 3 has degree 0.
Vertices 0, 3 have the same degree so they can be arranged in any order.

The sorted list of vertices becomes: 3, 0, 7, 5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 1, 2.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the number of triangles in the given graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are:
<2, 1, 8>
<2, 7, 5>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 4, 1>
<8, 5, 1>
<9, 6, 4>
