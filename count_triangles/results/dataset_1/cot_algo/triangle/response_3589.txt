Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices: 1(1), 8(1), 0(2), 3(2), 7(2), 2(2), 5(3), 8(3), 4(5), 9(5)

Next, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertices: 1(1), 8(2), 0(3), 3(4), 7(5), 2(6), 5(7), 8(8), 4(9), 9(10)

Now, we will go through the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have lower degree than vertex 9, so we proceed.
    Shared connections with vertices 3 and 5 form a triangle <0, 3, 5>.

- Edge (2, 9): Both vertices have lower degree than vertex 10, so we proceed.

- Edge (3, 6): Both vertices have lower degree than vertex 9, so we proceed.

- Edge (4, 6): Both vertices have lower degree than vertex 9, so we proceed.

- Edge (4, 8): Vertex 8 has a lower degree than vertex 9, so we skip.

- Edge (4, 9): Vertex 9 has a lower degree than vertex 10, so we proceed.

- Edge (5, 6): Both vertices have lower degree than vertex 9, so we proceed.

- Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 has a lower degree than vertex 10, so we skip.

Finally, we count the total number of triangles:
Total triangles: [1]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 3, 5>
