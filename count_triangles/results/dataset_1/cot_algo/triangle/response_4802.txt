Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 -> 5 connections
1 -> 2 connections
2 -> 5 connections
3 -> 6 connections
4 -> 4 connections
5 -> 6 connections
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 3 connections
8 -> 5 connections
9 -> 1 connection

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:

0 -> 9
1 -> 3
2 -> 8
3 -> 1
4 -> 7
5 -> 2
6 -> 6
7 -> 4
8 -> 0
9 -> 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check for triangles based on the given edges while ensuring that each triangle is only counted once:

Triangles found: <2, 5, 8>, <3, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
