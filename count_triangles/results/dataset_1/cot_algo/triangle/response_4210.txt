Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Here is the sorted list:
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 8

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles formed by following the Degree-Based Ordering method.

After counting, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 9>.
