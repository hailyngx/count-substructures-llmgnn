Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by number of connections:  
1. 3 connections: 0, 8, 9  
2. 2 connections: 3, 5, 6  
3. 1 connection: 1, 2, 4, 7

Triangles found:  
<0, 8, 9>  
<0, 9, 3>  

Total number of triangles: [2]
