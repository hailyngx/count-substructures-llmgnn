Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
0 → 0
1 → 1
3 → 2
8 → 3
9 → 4
4 → 5
5 → 6
7 → 7
2 → 8
6 → 9

Examining the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 0 and 1 are 9, giving triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connections with 2 and 4 are 5, giving triangle <2, 4, 5>.
- Edge (2, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles.
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (4, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 2): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles.
- Edge (6, 9): Shared connections with 6 and 9 are 0, giving triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 3): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 5): No triangles.
- Edge (7, 6): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 9>.
