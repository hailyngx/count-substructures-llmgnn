Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph:

Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 6 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 6 connections.

Sorted vertices: 6, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 7, 8, 0, 9

Now, we will iterate through the edges starting from the ones connected to the lower labeled vertices and count the triangles formed:
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 2: <0, 1, 2>
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 5: <0, 2, 5>
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 9: <0, 4, 9>
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 9: <0, 7, 9>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 9: <0, 8, 9>
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 0: <1, 2, 0>
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 0: <2, 5, 0>
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 0: <2, 8, 0>
- Edge (3, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection to node 0: <3, 5, 0>
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 0>.
