Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees for each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
- Node 2 (degree 1)
- Node 9 (degree 1)
- Node 1 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 3)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 6)

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (2, 1): No triangle
- Edge (2, 3): No triangle
- Edge (9, 3): No triangle
- Edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Edge (4, 3): No triangle
- Edge (0, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Edge (5, 3): Triangle <5, 3, 7>
- Edge (6, 3): Triangle <6, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 3): Triangle <7, 3, 8>
- Edge (8, 3): Triangle <3, 8, 6>

Counting the triangles found above, we get:
