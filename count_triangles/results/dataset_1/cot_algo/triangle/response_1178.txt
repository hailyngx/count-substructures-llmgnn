Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 1: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph.

We start by looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles formed by edge (0, 3):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (0, 9):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (4, 1):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (4, 5):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (5, 1):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (5, 4):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (5, 6):
- Shared connections: <1, 5, 6>

Triangles formed by edge (5, 9):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (7, 2):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (8, 3):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (9, 0):
- Shared connections: None

Triangles formed by edge (9, 8):
- Shared connections: None
