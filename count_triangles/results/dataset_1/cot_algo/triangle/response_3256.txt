Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorted vertices based on their degrees:  
- Vertex 0: degree 3  
- Vertex 6: degree 1  
- Vertex 2: degree 2  
- Vertex 8: degree 2  
- Vertex 4: degree 3  
- Vertex 5: degree 3  
- Vertex 7: degree 3  
- Vertex 3: degree 3  
- Vertex 9: degree 3  
- Vertex 1: degree 5
