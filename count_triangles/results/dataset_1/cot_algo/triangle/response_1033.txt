Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and then relabeling them accordingly, the graph can be represented as follows:

Vertices: 5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 4, 2, 8, 9, 0

Edges: (5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 7), (4, 6), (6, 4), (4, 2), (2, 8), (8, 9), (9, 0), (0, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 0), (2, 0), (4, 6), (6, 2), (0, 7), (0, 9), (9, 8)

After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles in the graph:

1. <2, 4, 8>
2. <0, 2, 9>
3. <0, 2, 8>
4. <0, 7, 9>
5. <0, 9, 3>
6. <4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
