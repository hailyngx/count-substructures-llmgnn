Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following order: 

Node 6 (degree 1)  
Node 7 (degree 2)  
Node 0 (degree 3)  
Node 3 (degree 4)  
Node 5 (degree 4)  
Node 9 (degree 4)  
Node 8 (degree 5)  
Node 1 (degree 6)  
Node 2 (degree 6)  
Node 4 (degree 6)  

Using the degree-based ordering principle, we will go through each edge considering the node with the lower label having fewer connections. 

Calculating the triangles:  
- Using edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 0 and 1 are [3, 4]. Triangle: <0, 1, 4>.  
- Using edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0 and 2 are [3]. No triangle formed.  
- Using edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 0 and 3 are [2, 4]. Triangle: <0, 2, 3>.  
- Using edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 1 and 4 are [8, 9]. Triangle: <1, 4, 8>.  
- Using edge (2, 4): Shared connections with 2 and 4 are [5, 9]. Triangle: <2, 4, 5>.  
- Using edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 4 are [8]. No triangle formed.  
- Using edge (5, 4): Shared connections with 5 and 4 are [8]. No triangle formed.  
- Using edge (7, 5): Shared connections with 7 and 5 are [9]. No triangle formed.  
- Using edge (6, 8): Shared connections with 6 and 8 are []. No triangle formed.  
- Using edge (9, 7): Shared connections with 9 and 7 are []. No triangle formed.  

Total number of triangles: [3]
