Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 6 connections

Now, based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the vertices:

- Vertex 0 → Vertex 0 (Degree: 1)
- Vertex 7 → Vertex 1 (Degree: 1)
- Vertex 8 → Vertex 2 (Degree: 1)
- Vertex 4 → Vertex 3 (Degree: 1)
- Vertex 5 → Vertex 4 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 3 → Vertex 5 (Degree: 2)
- Vertex 6 → Vertex 6 (Degree: 3)
- Vertex 1 → Vertex 7 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 2 → Vertex 8 (Degree: 4)
- Vertex 9 → Vertex 9 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges and shared connections:

- Triangle <1, 9, 6>
- Triangle <1, 9, 5>
- Triangle <1, 9, 4>
- Triangle <1, 6, 2>
- Triangle <1, 6, 9>
- Triangle <1, 6, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <9, 6, 2>
- Triangle <9, 6, 5>
- Triangle <9, 6, 4>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles which is 10 and present the unique triangles found inside brackets:

[10]
<1, 9, 6>, <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 4>, <1, 6, 2>, <1, 6, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <9, 6, 2>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 6, 4>
