Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 3, 7, 9, 8, 1, 4, 2, 6, 0, 5.

The triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [10].
