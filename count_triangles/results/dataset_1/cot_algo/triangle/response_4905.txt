Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices would be:
Node 3 - 0 connections
Node 4 - 0 connections
Node 7 - 0 connections
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 2 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 4 connections
Node 8 - 4 connections
Node 5 - 5 connections
Node 0 - 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles by examining the edges:

For the edge between Node 0 and Node 1: 
  - Node 0 and Node 1 share connections with Nodes 8 and 9, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
  
For the edge between Node 0 and Node 6: 
  - Node 0 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 6, 5>.

For the edge between Node 0 and Node 8: 
  - Node 0 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 8, 2>.

For the edge between Node 0 and Node 9: 
  - Node 0 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 5, forming a triangle <0, 9, 5>.

For the edge between Node 1 and Node 2: 
  - Node 1 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.

For the edge between Node 1 and Node 5: 
  - Node 1 and Node 5 share connections with Nodes 6 and 8, forming two triangles <1, 5, 6> and <1, 5, 8>.

For the edge between Node 2 and Node 4: 
  - Node 2 and Node 4 do not form a triangle as Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 2.

For the edge between Node 5 and Node 6: 
  - Node 5 and Node 6 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <5, 6, 0>.

For the edge between Node 5 and Node 7: 
  - Node 5 and Node 7 do not form a triangle as Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 5.

For the edge between Node 5 and Node 8: 
  - Node 5 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <5, 8, 0>.

For the edge between Node 5 and Node 9: 
  - Node 5 and Node 9 share a connection with Node 0, forming a triangle <5, 9, 0>.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
