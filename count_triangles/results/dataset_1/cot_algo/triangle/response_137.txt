Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we can relabel them as follows: 

Vertex 0: 1 connection  
Vertex 1: 3 connections  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 4: 3 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 2 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 3: 6 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the triangles formed by the given edges: 
- <1, 3, 4>  
- <3, 5, 8>  
- <3, 6, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
