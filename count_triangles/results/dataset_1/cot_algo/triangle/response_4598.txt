Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling becomes:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
(0, 3) forms triangle with shared connection 5: <0, 3, 5>
(0, 4) forms triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 4, 2>
(0, 5) forms triangle with shared connection 2: <0, 5, 2>
(1, 6) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <1, 6, 9>
(1, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <1, 8, 9>
(1, 9) forms triangle with shared connection 6: <1, 9, 6>
(2, 4) forms triangle with shared connection 0: <2, 4, 0>
(2, 5) forms triangle with shared connection 0: <2, 5, 0>
(2, 7) forms triangle with shared connection 6: <2, 7, 6>
(3, 0) forms triangle with shared connection 5: <3, 0, 5>
(3, 5) forms triangle with shared connection 0: <3, 5, 0>
(5, 2) forms triangle with shared connection 0: <5, 2, 0>
(6, 1) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <6, 1, 9>
(6, 7) forms triangle with shared connection 2: <6, 7, 2>
(6, 9) forms triangle with shared connection 1: <6, 9, 1>
(7, 2) forms triangle with shared connection 6: <7, 2, 6>
(8, 1) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <8, 1, 9>
(8, 9) forms triangle with shared connection 1: <8, 9, 1>
(9, 6) forms triangle with shared connection 1: <9, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [19].
