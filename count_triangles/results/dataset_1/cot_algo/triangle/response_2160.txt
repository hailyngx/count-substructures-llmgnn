Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes: 2, 6, 9, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7, 0, 8

Edges to consider:
(2, 5)
(6, 2)
(9, 1)
(4, 0)
(6, 7)
(1, 4)
(1, 7)
(1, 8)
(5, 0)
(5, 2)

Calculating triangles:

Triangles: <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 8>
Total number of triangles: [2]
