Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: <4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 0, 6, 7, 9, 8>. 

Now, we will identify the triangles in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 6, and 9. Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 5, and 7. Since the lower labeled vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangle <0, 1, 5>.

2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 6, and 9. Vertex 6 has connections with vertices 0, 2, and 7. Since the lower labeled vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangle <0, 6, 2>.

3. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 6, and 9. Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since the lower labeled vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangles <0, 9, 2> and <0, 9, 7>.

4. Edge (1, 0): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 1).

5. Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 0, 5, and 7. Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 1 and 9. Since the lower labeled vertex 1 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangle <1, 5, 9>.

6. Edge (1, 7): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (1, 5).

7. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 4, 6, 7, and 9. Vertex 4 has a connection with vertex 2. Since the lower labeled vertex 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangle <2, 4, 6>.

8. Edge (2, 6): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 6).

9. Edge (2, 7): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 6).

10. Edge (2, 9): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 9).

11. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has a connection with vertex 7. Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 3, and 9. Since the lower labeled vertex 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Triangle <3, 7, 9>.

12. Edge (3, 9): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 9).

13. Edge (4, 2): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (2, 4).

14. Edge (5, 1): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (1, 5).

15. Edge (5, 9): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (1, 5).

16. Edge (6, 0): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 6).

17. Edge (6, 2): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 6).

18. Edge (7, 1): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (1, 5).

19. Edge (7, 2): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (2, 4).

20. Edge (7, 3): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (3, 7).

21. Edge (7, 9): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (3, 7).

22. Edge (9, 0): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 9).

23. Edge (9, 2): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (0, 9).

24. Edge (9, 3): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (3, 7).

25. Edge (9, 5): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (1, 5).

26. Edge (9, 7): This edge has been counted when analyzing edge (3, 7).

Based on the above analysis, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
