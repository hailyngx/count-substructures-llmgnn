Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree in increasing order, we get the following labels for the vertices:
Node 0: Degree = 3
Node 2: Degree = 3
Node 6: Degree = 1
Node 3: Degree = 3
Node 5: Degree = 3
Node 1: Degree = 4
Node 9: Degree = 4
Node 8: Degree = 3
Node 7: Degree = 4
Node 4: Degree = 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Considering each edge:
(0, 1): Forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>
(0, 4): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>
(0, 5): No triangle formed
(1, 0): Already considered
(1, 2): No triangle formed
(1, 4): Already considered
(1, 5): Forms a triangle <1, 5, 7>
(2, 1): Already considered
(2, 3): No triangle formed
(2, 6): No triangle formed
(3, 2): Already considered
(3, 4): Forms a triangle <3, 4, 9>
(3, 9): Forms a triangle <3, 9, 7>
(4, 0): Already considered
(4, 1): Already considered
(4, 3): Already considered
(4, 7): Forms a triangle <4, 7, 9>
(4, 8): No triangle formed
(4, 9): Already considered
(5, 0): Already considered
(5, 1): Already considered
(5, 7): No triangle formed
(6, 2): No triangle formed
(7, 4): Already considered
(7, 5): Already considered
(7, 8): No triangle formed
(7, 9): Already considered
(8, 4): Already considered
(8, 7): Already considered
(9, 3): Already considered
(9, 4): Already considered
(9, 7): Already considered

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 9>.
