Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 0 - Degree 2  
Node 1 - Degree 2  
Node 2 - Degree 1  
Node 4 - Degree 5  
Node 5 - Degree 2  
Node 6 - Degree 4  
Node 7 - Degree 4  
Node 8 - Degree 1  
Node 9 - Degree 4  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) can form a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (2, 0) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) can form a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (4, 7) can form a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (4, 9) can form a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (5, 4) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) can form a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 9) can form a triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 4) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 8) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) can form a triangle <4, 6, 7>.
- Edge (8, 7) cannot form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 4) cannot form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, and <4, 6, 9>.
