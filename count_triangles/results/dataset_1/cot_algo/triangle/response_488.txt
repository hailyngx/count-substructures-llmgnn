Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their connections in ascending order, the new numbering for the vertices is: 

(0 → 2 connections),
(1 → 3 connections),
(2 → 1 connection),
(3 → 3 connections),
(4 → 3 connections),
(5 → 2 connections),
(6 → 5 connections),
(7 → 4 connections),
(8 → 4 connections),
(9 → 2 connections).

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed to count the number of triangles formed by shared connections:

1. (0, 6) and (0, 7) share vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 6, 7>.
2. (0, 6) and (0, 8) share vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 6, 8>.
3. (0, 7) and (0, 8) share vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 7, 8>.
4. (4, 1) and (1, 6) share vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 6>.
5. (1, 6) and (1, 8) share vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 6, 8>.
6. (3, 4) and (4, 1) share vertex 4, forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.
7. (3, 4) and (4, 3) share vertex 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 1>.
8. (3, 6) and (6, 1) share vertex 6, forming triangle <1, 3, 6>.
9. (5, 7) and (7, 0) share vertex 7, forming triangle <0, 5, 7>.
10. (5, 7) and (7, 4) share vertex 7, forming triangle <4, 5, 7>.
11. (5, 7) and (7, 6) share vertex 7, forming triangle <5, 6, 7>.
12. (5, 8) and (8, 1) share vertex 8, forming triangle <1, 5, 8>.
13. (5, 8) and (8, 0) share vertex 8, forming triangle <0, 5, 8>.
14. (5, 8) and (8, 9) share vertex 8, forming triangle <5, 8, 9>.
15. (6, 2) and (2, 6) share vertex 6, forming triangle <2, 6, 3>.
16. (6, 0) and (0, 6) share vertex 6, forming triangle <0, 6, 4>.
17. (6, 0) and (0, 8) share vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 6, 5>.
18. (6, 0) and (0, 7) share vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 6, 7>.
19. (6, 1) and (1, 4) share vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 6>.
20. (6, 1) and (1, 8) share vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 6, 8>.
21. (6, 3) and (3, 4) share vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 4, 6>.
22. (6, 3) and (3, 9) share vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 6, 9>.
23. (6, 7) and (7, 0) share vertex 7, forming triangle <0, 6, 7>.
24. (6, 7) and (7, 4) share vertex 7, forming triangle <4, 6, 7>.
25. (6, 7) and (7, 5) share vertex 7, forming triangle <5, 6, 7>.
26. (7, 4) and (4, 1) share vertex 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
27. (7, 4) and (4, 3) share vertex 4, forming triangle <3, 4, 7>.
28. (7, 5) and (5, 8) share vertex 5, forming triangle <5, 8, 7>.
29. (7, 6) and (6, 0) share vertex 6, forming triangle <0, 6, 7>.
30. (8, 9) and (9, 3) share vertex 9, forming triangle <3, 8, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [30] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 6, 3>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 5, 7>.
