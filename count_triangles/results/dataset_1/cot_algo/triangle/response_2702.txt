Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):

Nodes: 1(2), 4(2), 0(3), 2(3), 5(3), 6(3), 8(1), 9(4), 3(4), 7(5)

Next, let's relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

Nodes: 1(0), 4(1), 0(2), 2(2), 5(2), 6(2), 8(3), 9(3), 3(4), 7(5)

Now we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [10]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 8, 5>, <7, 9, 3>
