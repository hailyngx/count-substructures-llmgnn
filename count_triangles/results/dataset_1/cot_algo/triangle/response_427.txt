Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
```
0 -> 0 connections
2 -> 1 connection
8 -> 1 connection
7 -> 2 connections
5 -> 2 connections
1 -> 2 connections
4 -> 2 connections
6 -> 3 connections
3 -> 4 connections
9 -> 6 connections
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (0, 1): No triangles.
2. (0, 5): No triangles.
3. (1, 4): No triangles.
4. (2, 9): No triangles.
5. (3, 6): No triangles.
6. (3, 9): No triangles.
7. (4, 8): No triangles.
8. (5, 7): No triangles.
9. (6, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [0]
