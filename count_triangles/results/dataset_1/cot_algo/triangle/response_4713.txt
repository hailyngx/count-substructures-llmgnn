Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph.

First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will examine each edge, starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex:

1. Edge (0, 3): Both nodes have degree 3. No triangle.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 (degree 2) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2): Both nodes have degree 2. No triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 (degree 2) is the lower labeled vertex. No shared connections.
5. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
7. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. Shared connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
8. Edge (3, 5): Node 3 (degree 3) is the lower labeled vertex. No shared connections.
9. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 (degree 3) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
10. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 (degree 3) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
11. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
12. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. Shared connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <5, 7, 8>.
13. Edge (5, 8): Node 5 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
14. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 (degree 4) is the lower labeled vertex. No shared connections.
15. Edge (6, 9): Node 6 (degree 4) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
16. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 (degree 4) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.
17. Edge (9, 4): Node 4 (degree 3) is the lower labeled vertex. No shared connections.
18. Edge (9, 5): Node 5 (degree 5) is the lower labeled vertex. Shared connection with Node 9, forming a triangle <2, 4, 9>.
19. Edge (9, 6): Node 6 (degree 4) is the lower labeled vertex. No triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <2, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
