Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks as follows:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(4, 3), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 8), (5, 2), (2, 6), (2, 8), (6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (9, 6), (7, 3), (3, 8), (1, 7), (6, 5), (8, 0), (3, 4), (9, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (7, 1), (5, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 6), (8, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (1, 0), (5, 6), (2, 5), (6, 2), (8, 0).

By examining the shared connections between the nodes, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <4, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
