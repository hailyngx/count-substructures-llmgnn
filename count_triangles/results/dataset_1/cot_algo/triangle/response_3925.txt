Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree. Here are the vertices with their respective degrees:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 6 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted degrees:

0 → 3 connections
3 → 7 connections
7 → 8 connections
8 → 0 connections
6 → 5 connections
5 → 1 connections
1 → 2 connections
2 → 6 connections
9 → 4 connections
4 → 9 connections

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles formed by each edge. But, we will only count a triangle if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex.

After going through all the edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].

List of unique triangles found:
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
