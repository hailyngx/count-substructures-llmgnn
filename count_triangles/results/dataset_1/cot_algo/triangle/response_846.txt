Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly. 

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:
(1) 5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 0, 9

Now, we will go through the edges in increasing order of the lower labeled vertex:

(1, 5): No triangles
(1, 6): No triangles
(2, 4): No triangles
(2, 6): No triangles
(2, 7): No triangles
(3, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 4>
(3, 9): No triangles
(4, 7): Triangle <3, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 6>
(4, 8): No triangles
(5, 7): No triangles
(6, 8): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
The unique triangles found are <3, 7, 4> and <4, 7, 6>.
