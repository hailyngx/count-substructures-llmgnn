Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on the number of connections they have:

Vertices:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
3: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
6: 3 connections
9: 4 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 6 connections
2: 8 connections

Now, we can start counting the triangles following the Degree-Based Ordering method. Since the vertex with the lower label must have fewer connections, the vertex pairs we will consider are: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 9).

After checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
