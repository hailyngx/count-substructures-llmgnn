Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The initial numbering of the vertices based on their degrees is as follows:
0 - 3 connections
1 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
8 - 2 connections
9 - 1 connection
3 - 3 connections
6 - 4 connections
4 - 4 connections
7 - 5 connections
2 - 6 connections

After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the new edge list becomes:
(9, 2) (1, 0) (5, 7) (8, 2) (5, 3) (9, 2) (0, 4) (9, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (3, 2) (1, 7) (6, 4) (3, 8) (1, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (9, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (1, 7) (7, 2) (8, 2) (2, 9) (8, 3)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <2, 6, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 8>
