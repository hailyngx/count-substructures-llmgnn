Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 3, 6, 7, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can proceed to count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2) - Shared connections: 2
2. Edge (0, 8) - Shared connections: None
3. Edge (1, 2) - Shared connections: 2
4. Edge (1, 7) - Shared connections: 1
5. Edge (2, 0) - Shared connections: 2
6. Edge (2, 1) - Shared connections: 2
7. Edge (2, 8) - Shared connections: None
8. Edge (2, 9) - Shared connections: None
9. Edge (3, 6) - Shared connections: None
10. Edge (3, 8) - Shared connections: None
11. Edge (3, 9) - Shared connections: None
12. Edge (4, 5) - Shared connections: None
13. Edge (4, 7) - Shared connections: None
14. Edge (5, 4) - Shared connections: None
15. Edge (5, 6) - Shared connections: None
16. Edge (6, 3) - Shared connections: None
17. Edge (6, 5) - Shared connections: None
18. Edge (6, 7) - Shared connections: None
19. Edge (7, 1) - Shared connections: 1
20. Edge (7, 4) - Shared connections: None
21. Edge (7, 6) - Shared connections: None
22. Edge (7, 9) - Shared connections: None
23. Edge (8, 0) - Shared connections: None
24. Edge (8, 2) - Shared connections: None
25. Edge (8, 3) - Shared connections: None
26. Edge (9, 2) - Shared connections: None
27. Edge (9, 3) - Shared connections: None
28. Edge (9, 7) - Shared connections: None
