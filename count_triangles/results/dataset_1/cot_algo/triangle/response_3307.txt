Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree are as follows: 

Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 3: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 5: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 6
Vertex 9: degree 6

Starting with the edge (0, 2), we see that vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.

Calculating triangles:
1. (0, 2) shares connections with (2, 6) and (0, 6), forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. (0, 6) shares connections with (6, 3) and (0, 3), forming triangle <0, 6, 3>.
3. (0, 9) shares connections with (9, 1) and (0, 1), forming triangle <0, 9, 1>.

The total number of triangles: [3]
