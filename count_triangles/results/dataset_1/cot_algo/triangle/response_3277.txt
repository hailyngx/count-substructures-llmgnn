Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degree:
Node 3 -> 0
Node 6 -> 1
Node 0 -> 2
Node 2 -> 3
Node 4 -> 4
Node 5 -> 5
Node 9 -> 6
Node 1 -> 7
Node 8 -> 8
Node 7 -> 9

Now, we will traverse each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 1): No triangles
(0, 7): <0, 7, 9>
(1, 0): No triangles
(1, 8): <1, 7, 8>
(1, 9): No triangles
(2, 4): No triangles
(2, 6): No triangles
(2, 7): No triangles
(3, 7): No triangles
(4, 2): No triangles
(4, 8): <4, 8, 1>
(5, 7): No triangles
(5, 8): <5, 8, 1>
(6, 2): No triangles
(7, 0): <7, 9, 0>
(7, 2): No triangles
(7, 3): No triangles
(7, 5): No triangles
(7, 9): <7, 9, 0>
(8, 1): No triangles
(8, 4): <8, 4, 1>
(8, 5): <8, 5, 1>
(9, 1): No triangles
(9, 7): <9, 7, 0>

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 1>, <7, 9, 0>
