Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 0 (degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 2 (degree 3)
- Vertex 3 (degree 3)
- Vertex 4 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 1)
- Vertex 7 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(6, 7), (5, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (7, 6), (9, 5)

The triangles found in the graph are:
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
