Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

Node 5 has degree 1.  
Node 7 has degree 1.  
Node 0 has degree 2.  
Node 6 has degree 2.  
Node 0 has degree 2.  
Node 7 has degree 2.  
Node 5 has degree 2.  
Node 3 has degree 3.  
Node 6 has degree 3.  
Node 8 has degree 5.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the following edges in order:

Node 5 - Node 8: Shared connections {1, 4}. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 5>.  
Node 7 - Node 8: Shared connections {1}. No new triangles formed.  
Node 0 - Node 9: Shared connections {}. No new triangles formed.  
Node 6 - Node 8: Shared connections {4}. No new triangles formed.  
Node 0 - Node 9: Shared connections {}. No new triangles formed.  
Node 5 - Node 8: Shared connections {4}. No new triangles formed.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
