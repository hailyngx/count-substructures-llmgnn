Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by their degree (number of connections):
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
8 (degree 1)
5 (degree 0)
2 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
6 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)

Next, we will label the vertices accordingly, starting from the lowest degree:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
3 -> 2
8 -> 3
5 -> 4
2 -> 5
9 -> 6
4 -> 7
6 -> 8
7 -> 9

Now, we will look at the edges only considering cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking for triangles:
(0, 2) - Both have 2 connections, continue.
(0, 7) - Vertex 0 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 4), forming triangle <0, 2, 7>.
(1, 6) - Both have 2 connections, continue.
(1, 7) - Vertex 1 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 4), forming triangle <1, 6, 7>.
(2, 4) - Vertex 2 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4), forming triangle <2, 0, 4>.
(2, 9) - Both have 3 connections, continue.
(4, 3) - Vertex 4 (degree 4) has fewer connections than vertex 2 (degree 3), forming triangle <4, 0, 3>.
(6, 4) - Vertex 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4), forming triangle <6, 1, 4>.
(6, 9) - Vertex 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4), forming triangle <6, 1, 9>.
(7, 8) - Vertex 7 (degree 4) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 4), forming triangle <7, 0, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 0, 4>, <4, 0, 3>, and <6, 1, 9>.
