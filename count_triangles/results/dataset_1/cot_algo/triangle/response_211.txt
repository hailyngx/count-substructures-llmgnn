Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices by degree:
0: 2
1: 2
3: 2
4: 2
9: 2
5: 4
6: 4
7: 6

Next, we need to relabel the vertices based on their degree:
0: 0
1: 1
3: 2
4: 3
9: 4
5: 5
6: 6
7: 7

Now, we will examine the edges based on the ordering of the vertices:

(0, 7): No triangles
(1, 6): No triangles
(1, 9): No triangles
(3, 5): No triangles
(4, 7): No triangles
(5, 3): No triangles
(5, 6): No triangles
(5, 7): Triangle <3, 5, 7>
(6, 1): No triangles
(6, 5): No triangles
(7, 0): No triangles
(7, 4): No triangles
(7, 5): Triangle <5, 6, 7>
(7, 9): No triangles
(9, 1): No triangles
(9, 7): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2], and the unique triangles found are <3, 5, 7> and <5, 6, 7>.
