Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will examine the edges starting from edges with the lowest labeled vertex and proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We count the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
