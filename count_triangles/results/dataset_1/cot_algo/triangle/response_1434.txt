Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following order: 

Nodes:
0 - degree 3
1 - degree 1
4 - degree 3
7 - degree 3
2 - degree 4
5 - degree 4
8 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
3 - degree 5
9 - degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles:
- For edge (0, 3), vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 3 has 5 connections. Since vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 3: 4, 5
  - Triangle found: <0, 4, 5>

- For edge (0, 4), vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 4 has 3 connections. Since they have the same number of connections, we cannot form a triangle.

- For edge (0, 5), vertex 0 has 3 connections and vertex 5 has 4 connections. Since vertex 0 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between vertices 0 and 5: 3, 2
  - Triangle found: <0, 2, 3>

- For edge (1, 9), we cannot form a triangle as vertex 1 has only one connection.

- For edge (2, 3), vertex 2 has 4 connections and vertex 3 has 5 connections. Since vertex 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  - Shared connections between vertices 2 and 3: 5, 9
  - Triangle found: <2, 5, 9>

- For the rest of the edges, no triangles can be formed following the degree-based ordering method.

The total number of triangles found in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, and <2, 5, 9>.
