Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices and their connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0: 3, 7, 9
- Vertex 1: 4, 7
- Vertex 2: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Vertex 3: 0, 2, 6
- Vertex 4: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Vertex 5: 4, 8
- Vertex 6: 2, 3
- Vertex 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Vertex 8: 2, 4, 5
- Vertex 9: 0, 2, 4

According to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we need to start with the vertices with the least connections.
The ordering of vertices is: 1, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 3, 4, 7, 2.

Now, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle 3: <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 8>
- Triangle 5: <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
