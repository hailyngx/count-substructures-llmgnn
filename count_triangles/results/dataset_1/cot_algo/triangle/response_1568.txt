Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following order: 

Node 4 (Degree 1)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 2 (Degree 2)  
Node 3 (Degree 3)  
Node 5 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 4)  
Node 7 (Degree 5)  
Node 8 (Degree 5)  
Node 0 (Degree 5)  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the number of triangles:
For each edge, we check the shared connections to find triangles.

<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<1, 7, 9>  
<1, 7, 8>  
<2, 5, 8>  
<5, 7, 9>  
<7, 8, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
