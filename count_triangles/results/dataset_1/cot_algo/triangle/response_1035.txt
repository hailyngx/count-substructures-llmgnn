Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, re-label the nodes from least connected to most connected:
- Node 2 (label 0)
- Node 5 (label 1)
- Node 0 (label 2)
- Node 1 (label 3)
- Node 4 (label 4)
- Node 7 (label 5)
- Node 8 (label 6)
- Node 3 (label 7)
- Node 6 (label 8)
- Node 9 (label 9)

Next, we will examine each edge, considering only cases where the lower labeled node has fewer connections.

Looking at the edges:
- (0, 3): Node 0 (label 2) has 2 connections, and Node 3 (label 7) has 3 connections.
- (0, 7): Node 0 (label 2) has 2 connections, and Node 7 (label 5) has 3 connections.
- (1, 3): Node 1 (label 3) has 2 connections, and Node 3 (label 7) has 3 connections.
- (1, 6): Node 1 (label 3) has 2 connections, and Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections.
- (2, 4): Node 2 (label 0) has 1 connection, and Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections.
- (4, 8): Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 8 (label 6) has 3 connections.
- (4, 9): Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections, and Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections.
- (6, 1): Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections, and Node 1 (label 3) has 2 connections.
- (6, 7): Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections, and Node 7 (label 5) has 3 connections.
- (6, 8): Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections, and Node 8 (label 6) has 3 connections.
- (6, 9): Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections, and Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections.
- (7, 0): Node 7 (label 5) has 3 connections, and Node 0 (label 2) has 2 connections.
- (8, 4): Node 8 (label 6) has 3 connections, and Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections.
- (8, 6): Node 8 (label 6) has 3 connections, and Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections.
- (8, 9): Node 8 (label 6) has 3 connections, and Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections.
- (9, 4): Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections, and Node 4 (label 4) has 3 connections.
- (9, 5): Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections, and Node 5 (label 1) has 1 connection.
- (9, 6): Node 9 (label 9) has 4 connections, and Node 6 (label 8) has 4 connections.
