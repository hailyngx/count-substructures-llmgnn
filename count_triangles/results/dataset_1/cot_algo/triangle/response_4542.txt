Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is as follows: 9, 0, 1, 6, 5, 4, 2, 7, 3.

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph, starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex. We will only consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

1. Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so we proceed.
2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 6. Shared connections: 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 6>.
3. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have the same number of connections, so we proceed.
4. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7. Shared connections: 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>.
5. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 4. Shared connections: 4. Triangle: <2, 4, 7>.
6. Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
7. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 7. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
8. Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 4. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
9. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 5. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
10. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 7. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
11. Edge (4, 1): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 1. Skip.
12. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2. Skip.
13. Edge (4, 3): Vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 3. Skip.
14. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has the same number of connections as vertex 7. Shared connections: 4. Triangle: <1, 4, 7>.
15. Edge (5, 2): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2. Skip.
16. Edge (5, 3): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3. Skip.
17. Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 6. Skip.
18. Edge (6, 0): Vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 0. Skip.
19. Edge (6, 5): Vertex 6 has the same number of connections as vertex 5. Shared connections: None, so no triangle.
20. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 1. Skip.
21. Edge (7, 2): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 2. Skip.
22. Edge (7, 3): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 3. Skip.
23. Edge (7, 4): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 4. Skip.
24. Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 9. Skip.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 2, and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 6> and <1, 4, 7>. The answer is [2].
