Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections from least to most, we get the following order: 

Nodes: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 8, 4, 10, 3

After relabeling the vertices according to this order, we reexamine the edges:

(1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2)

We identify the triangles based on shared connections to find the total number of triangles and provide a list of unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <1, 0, 3>, <2, 3, 7>
