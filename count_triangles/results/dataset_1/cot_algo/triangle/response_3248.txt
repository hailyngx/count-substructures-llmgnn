Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves arranging the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Then we count the triangles by examining the connections between vertices.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Arrange vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
   Vertex 0: Degree 2
   Vertex 1: Degree 4
   Vertex 2: Degree 3
   Vertex 3: Degree 2
   Vertex 4: Degree 3
   Vertex 5: Degree 2
   Vertex 6: Degree 2
   Vertex 7: Degree 2
   Vertex 8: Degree 1
   Vertex 9: Degree 3

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order:
   Vertex 8 -> 0
   Vertex 6 -> 1
   Vertex 7 -> 2
   Vertex 0 -> 3
   Vertex 5 -> 4
   Vertex 3 -> 5
   Vertex 4 -> 6
   Vertex 9 -> 7
   Vertex 2 -> 8
   Vertex 1 -> 9

3. Now we consider the edges:

   - (0, 1) (1, 0): Form a triangle with vertex 3
   - (0, 9) (9, 0): No triangle
   - (1, 2) (2, 1): Form a triangle with vertex 9
   - (1, 6) (6, 1): No triangle
   - (2, 3) (3, 2): No triangle
   - (2, 4) (4, 2): No triangle
   - (3, 4) (4, 3): Form a triangle with vertex 6
   - (4, 5) (5, 4): No triangle
   - (5, 9) (9, 5): No triangle
   - (6, 7) (7, 6): No triangle
   - (7, 8) (8, 7): No triangle
