Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles in the graph.

Counting the triangles based on shared connections:
1. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 5, 1>
3. Triangle <0, 9, 2>
4. Triangle <1, 7, 9>
5. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <3, 4, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <3, 5, 1>
9. Triangle <3, 5, 0>
10. Triangle <4, 9, 8>
11. Triangle <5, 6, 3>
12. Triangle <5, 6, 1>
13. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
14. Triangle <5, 1, 7>
15. Triangle <5, 1, 9>
16. Triangle <5, 1, 0>
17. Triangle <6, 3, 5>
18. Triangle <8, 4, 9>
19. Triangle <9, 4, 8>
20. Triangle <9, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
