Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and relabeling the vertices accordingly, we get the following sorted vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 5, 4, 8, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 3

Now, we can check for triangles based on the sorted vertices:
1. Edge (1, 3) forms the triangle <1, 3, 4>.
2. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 6) forms the triangle <1, 6, 9>.
4. Edge (2, 4) forms the triangle <2, 4, 3>.
5. Edge (2, 6) forms the triangle <2, 6, 9>.
6. Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
7. Edge (3, 4) forms the triangle <3, 4, 2>.
8. Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 2) forms the triangle <4, 2, 6>.
10. Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (6, 1) forms the triangle <6, 1, 3>.
12. Edge (6, 2) forms the triangle <6, 2, 4>.
13. Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (7, 9) forms the triangle <7, 9, 6>.
16. Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (9, 6) forms the triangle <9, 6, 1>.

Total number of triangles: [8]
