Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)

Now, considering the edges in the graph according to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:

- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
