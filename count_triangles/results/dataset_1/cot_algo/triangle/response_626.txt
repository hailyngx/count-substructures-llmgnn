Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows: 

Nodes and their corresponding connections:
Node 3 -> 2 connections
Node 7 -> 2 connections
Node 1 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 8 -> 4 connections
Node 4 -> 5 connections
Node 9 -> 5 connections
Node 5 -> 6 connections
Node 2 -> 6 connections
Node 0 -> 7 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will check the edges in the following order:
(3, 5), (3, 6), (7, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0), (6, 9), (6, 5), (8, 0), (8, 2), (4, 0), (4, 5), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the number of triangles is [12].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 6>, <0, 8, 2>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 3>, <5, 9, 4>
