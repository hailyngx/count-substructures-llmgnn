Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections), the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 0: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 8: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6
Node 7: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
1. Triangle <0, 1, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 9>
3. Triangle <0, 5, 9>
4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <3, 6, 8>
6. Triangle <3, 7, 8>
7. Triangle <3, 7, 9>
8. Triangle <4, 7, 9>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 8>
10. Triangle <6, 7, 9>
11. Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
