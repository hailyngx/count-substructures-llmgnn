Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Reordering the nodes based on their degree:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections

Now, checking each edge while ensuring the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 (2 connections) and Node 5 (2 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <0, 5, x>.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 (2 connections) and Node 8 (5 connections) share no connections.
3. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 (5 connections) and Node 5 (2 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <1, 5, x>.
4. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 (5 connections) and Node 6 (4 connections) share no connections.
5. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 (5 connections) and Node 7 (4 connections) share no connections.
6. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 (5 connections) and Node 9 (5 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <1, 9, x>.
7. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 (2 connections) and Node 6 (4 connections) share no connections.
8. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 (3 connections) and Node 6 (4 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <3, 6, x>.
9. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 (3 connections) and Node 8 (5 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <3, 8, x>.
10. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 (2 connections) and Node 9 (5 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <4, 9, x>.
11. Edge (7, 8): Node 7 (4 connections) and Node 8 (5 connections) share no connections.
12. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 (4 connections) and Node 9 (5 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <7, 9, x>.
13. Edge (8, 9): Node 8 (5 connections) and Node 9 (5 connections) share a connection, forming a triangle <8, 9, x>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 5, x>, <1, 5, x>, <1, 9, x>, <3, 6, x>, <3, 8, x>, <4, 9, x>, <7, 9, x>, and <8, 9, x>.
