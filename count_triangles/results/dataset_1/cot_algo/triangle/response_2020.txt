Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each node:
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's relabel the nodes in increasing order of their degrees:
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 2
- Node 5: 3
- Node 9: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 7
- Node 1: 8
- Node 4: 9

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Look at edge (2, 4): Node 2 has degree 1 and Node 4 has degree 6, so proceed.
- Look at edge (3, 4): Node 3 has degree 1 and Node 4 has degree 6, so proceed.
- Look at edge (5, 7): Node 5 has degree 2 and Node 7 has degree 4, so proceed.
- Look at edge (5, 8): Node 5 has degree 2 and Node 8 has degree 4, so proceed.
- Look at edge (6, 7): Node 6 has degree 3 and Node 7 has degree 4, so proceed.
- Look at edge (6, 8): Node 6 has degree 3 and Node 8 has degree 4, so proceed.

Now, let's count the triangles formed by the shared connections of the edges:
- Triangles: <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <5, 7, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <6, 7, 5>, <6, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
