Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles and count them. 

The total number of triangles is [15].
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
