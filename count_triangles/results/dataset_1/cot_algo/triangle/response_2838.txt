Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 5
- Vertex 2 has degree 6

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 1 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 4 (Degree 1) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 7 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (Degree 2) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 0 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 6 (Degree 3) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 9 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 5 (Degree 4) -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (Degree 5) -> Vertex 8
- Vertex 2 (Degree 6) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:

- For the edge (0, 5), check shared connections:
  - Shared connections are 3 and 9
  - Triangle <0, 3, 9>

- For the edge (0, 8), proceed as vertex 0 has fewer connections.

- For the edge (1, 2), skip as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 2.

- For the edge (2, 1), proceed as vertex 1 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 2
  - Triangle <1, 2, 3>

- For the edge (2, 3), proceed as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 1, 5, and 9
  - Triangle <1, 2, 3> (Already counted)

- For the edge (2, 7), proceed as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 5 and 6
  - Triangle <1, 3, 5>

- For the edge (2, 8), proceed as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 0
  - Triangle <0, 3, 8>

- For the edge (2, 9), proceed as vertex 2 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 0 and 3
  - Triangle <0, 3, 9> (Already counted)

- For the edge (3, 2), skip as vertex 3 has more connections.

- For the edge (3, 5), proceed as vertex 3 has fewer connections.
  - Shared connections are 0, 6, and 9
  - Triangle <0, 3, 5>

- Other edges do not form triangles.

Total number of triangles: [3]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>
