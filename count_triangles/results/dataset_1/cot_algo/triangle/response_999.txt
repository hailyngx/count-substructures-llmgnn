Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the instructions for counting triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 2)
3 (degree 1)
4 (degree 1)
6 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
2 (degree 3)
5 (degree 4)
7 (degree 3)
8 (degree 5)

Now, we relabel the vertices from least to most connections:
0 -> 0 (degree 2)
3 -> 1 (degree 1)
4 -> 2 (degree 1)
6 -> 3 (degree 2)
9 -> 4 (degree 2)
1 -> 5 (degree 3)
2 -> 6 (degree 3)
5 -> 7 (degree 4)
7 -> 8 (degree 3)
8 -> 9 (degree 5)

Next, we check each edge to count the number of triangles formed:
(0, 3) and (3, 0): No triangles
(0, 8) and (8, 0): <0, 8, 9>
(1, 4) and (4, 1): No triangles
(1, 8) and (8, 1): <1, 8, 9>
(1, 9) and (9, 1): <1, 8, 9>
(2, 5) and (5, 2): No triangles
(2, 7) and (7, 2): No triangles
(3, 0) and (0, 3): No triangles
(4, 1) and (1, 4): No triangles
(5, 2) and (2, 5): No triangles
(5, 6) and (6, 5): No triangles
(5, 7) and (7, 5): <2, 5, 7>
(6, 5) and (5, 6): No triangles
(6, 8) and (8, 6): No triangles
(7, 2) and (2, 7): No triangles
(7, 5) and (5, 7): <2, 5, 7>
(8, 0) and (0, 8): <0, 8, 9>
(8, 1) and (1, 8): <1, 8, 9>
(8, 6) and (6, 8): No triangles
(8, 9) and (9, 8): <1, 8, 9>
(9, 1) and (1, 9): <1, 8, 9>
(9, 8) and (8, 9): <1, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9] and the unique triangles are <0, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 5, 7>.
