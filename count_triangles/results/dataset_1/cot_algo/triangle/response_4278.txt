Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections between nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Now, we will apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles in this graph.

Sorting the nodes by the number of connections (degree):
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 2 (degree 2)
Node 6 (degree 2)
Node 7 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 3 (degree 2)
Node 9 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 5)
Node 8 (degree 4)

We will consider each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections for finding triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
