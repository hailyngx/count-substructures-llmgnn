Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are labeled as follows based on their number of connections:
Node 2 - Degree: 2
Nodes 6, 8, 9 - Degree: 3
Nodes 5 - Degree: 4
Nodes 1, 3, 7 - Degree: 5
Node 4 - Degree: 6
Node 0 - Degree: 8

Based on the number of connections, the following edges can be considered:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)
(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7)
(2, 5)
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)
(4, 5), (4, 7)
(5, 2), (5, 7)
(6, 1), (6, 7)
(7, 8)

Now, counting the triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 1, 7>
4. Triangle <0, 3, 4>
5. Triangle <0, 3, 5>
6. Triangle <0, 3, 7>
7. Triangle <0, 7, 8>
8. Triangle <0, 7, 1>
9. Triangle <1, 5, 2>
10. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
11. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
12. Triangle <3, 4, 5>
13. Triangle <3, 5, 7>
14. Triangle <3, 7, 4>
15. Triangle <4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [15].
