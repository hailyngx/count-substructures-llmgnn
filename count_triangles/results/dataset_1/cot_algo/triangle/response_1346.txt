Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:  
Vertex 3: 1 connection  
Vertex 2: 2 connections  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 1: 3 connections  
Vertex 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  
Vertex 6: 4 connections  
Vertex 8: 4 connections  
Vertex 0: 6 connections  
Vertex 4: 6 connections  

2. Relabel the vertices based on their sorted order:  
New label - Old label  
0 - 0  
1 - 1  
2 - 3  
3 - 4  
4 - 5  
5 - 6  
6 - 7  
7 - 2  
8 - 9  
9 - 8  

Next, we will look at each edge, ensuring that the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, and count the number of triangles with shared connections:

(0, 1): No triangle  
(0, 3): No triangle  
(0, 4): <0, 4, 3>  
(0, 5): <0, 5, 4>  
(0, 6): <0, 6, 7>  
(0, 8): No triangle  
(1, 5): No triangle  
(1, 7): No triangle  
(2, 4): No triangle  
(2, 6): No triangle  
(3, 4): No triangle  
(4, 6): <4, 6, 7>  
(4, 7): <4, 7, 6>  
(4, 9): No triangle  
(5, 0): No triangle  
(5, 1): No triangle  
(6, 0): No triangle  
(6, 2): No triangle  
(6, 4): <6, 4, 7>  
(7, 1): No triangle  
(7, 4): <7, 4, 6>  
(7, 8): No triangle  
(7, 9): No triangle  
(8, 0): No triangle  
(8, 7): No triangle  
(8, 9): No triangle  
(9, 4): No triangle  
(9, 7): No triangle  
(9, 8): No triangle  

Total number of triangles: [3]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 3>, <0, 5, 4>, <0, 6, 7>
