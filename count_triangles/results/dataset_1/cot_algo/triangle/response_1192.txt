Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following order: 
Node 7 (degree 1) < Node 0 (degree 2), Node 1 (degree 2), Node 9 (degree 2) < Node 3 (degree 3), Node 2 (degree 4), Node 8 (degree 4) < Node 6 (degree 5), Node 5 (degree 6), Node 4 (degree 7)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
1. Node 0 and Node 4: No triangles found.
2. Node 1 and Node 5: No triangles found.
3. Node 1 and Node 8: No triangles found.
4. Node 2 and Node 4: Triangle <2, 4, 5>.
5. Node 2 and Node 6: No triangles found.
6. Node 3 and Node 5: No triangles found.
7. Node 3 and Node 6: No triangles found.
8. Node 4 and Node 0: No triangles found.
9. Node 4 and Node 2: No triangles found.
10. Node 4 and Node 5: No triangles found.
11. Node 4 and Node 7: No triangles found.
12. Node 4 and Node 9: No triangles found.
13. Node 5 and Node 1: No triangles found.
14. Node 5 and Node 3: No triangles found.
15. Node 5 and Node 4: No triangles found.
16. Node 5 and Node 6: Triangle <2, 5, 6>.
17. Node 5 and Node 8: No triangles found.
18. Node 6 and Node 2: No triangles found.
19. Node 6 and Node 3: No triangles found.
20. Node 6 and Node 5: Triangle <2, 5, 6>.
21. Node 6 and Node 8: Triangle <5, 6, 8>.
22. Node 7 and Node 4: No triangles found.
23. Node 8 and Node 1: No triangles found.
24. Node 8 and Node 5: No triangles found.
25. Node 8 and Node 6: Triangle <5, 6, 8>.
26. Node 8 and Node 9: No triangles found.
27. Node 9 and Node 4: No triangles found.
28. Node 9 and Node 8: No triangles found.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
