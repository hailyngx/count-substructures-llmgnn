Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degree:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 6
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4

Next, we'll proceed with counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Start with the edge (0, 6): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than Node 6's degree 4. Check for shared connections - shared connection with Node 6 is Node 2. So, the triangle formed is <0, 2, 6>.
2. Move on to the edge (0, 8): Node 0 has degree 3 which is less than Node 8's degree 2. No triangles are formed from this edge.
3. Edge (0, 9): Triangle <0, 7, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 7): Triangle <1, 9, 7>.
5. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed from this edge.
6. Edge (2, 4): Triangle <2, 7, 4>.
7. Edge (2, 6): Triangle <0, 2, 6>.
8. Edge (2, 7): Triangle <2, 4, 7>.
9. Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed from this edge.
10. Edge (3, 7): Triangle <3, 4, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 8): Triangle <0, 3, 8>.
12. Edge (4, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 7>. Note that this triangle was already counted.
13. Edge (4, 7): Triangle <2, 4, 7>. Already counted.
14. Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed from this edge.
15. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed from this edge.
16. Edge (6, 0): Triangle <0, 2, 6>. Already counted.
17. Edge (6, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 6>. Already counted.
18. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed from this edge.
19. Edge (7, 1): Triangle <1, 9, 7>. Already counted.
20. Edge (7, 2): Triangle <2, 4, 7>. Already counted.
21. Edge (7, 3): Triangle <3, 4, 7>. Already counted.
22. Edge (7, 4): Triangle <2, 4, 7>. Already counted.
23. Edge (7, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 7>. Already counted.
24. Edge (8, 0): Triangle <0, 3, 8>. Already counted.
25. Edge (8, 3): Triangle <0, 3, 8>. Already counted.
26. Edge (9, 0): Triangle <0, 7, 9>. Already counted.
27. Edge (9, 1): Triangle <1, 9, 7>. Already counted.
28. Edge (9, 7): Triangle <1, 9, 7>. Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 9, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>.
