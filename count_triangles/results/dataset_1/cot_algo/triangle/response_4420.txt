Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: Degree 1
Nodes 1 and 5: Degree 2
Nodes 0 and 5: Degree 3
Nodes 4 and 8: Degree 4
Nodes 2, 6, and 7: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 7

After sorting the vertices, the labels will be assigned as follows:
Node 3: 0
Nodes 1 and 5: 1 and 2
Nodes 0 and 5: 3 and 4
Nodes 4 and 8: 5 and 6
Nodes 2, 6, and 7: 7, 8, and 9
Node 9: 10

Now we will go through each edge by considering only the pair where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<0, 7>: No triangle
<0, 9>: No triangle
<1, 2>: No triangle
<1, 7>: No triangle
<2, 4>: No triangle
<2, 6>: No triangle
<2, 8>: No triangle
<2, 9>: <2, 6, 9>
<3, 8>: No triangle
<4, 2>: No triangle
<4, 6>: <4, 2, 6>
<4, 9>: <4, 6, 9>
<5, 6>: No triangle
<6, 2>: <6, 4, 2>
<6, 4>: <6, 2, 4>
<6, 5>: No triangle
<6, 9>: <6, 4, 9> and <6, 2, 9>
<7, 0>: No triangle
<7, 1>: No triangle
<7, 8>: No triangle
<7, 9>: <7, 0, 9> and <7, 1, 9>
<8, 2>: No triangle
<8, 3>: No triangle
<8, 7>: No triangle
<8, 9>: <8, 2, 9> and <8, 3, 9>
<9, 0>: No triangle
<9, 2>: <9, 4, 6>
<9, 4>: <9, 4, 6>
<9, 6>: <9, 4, 6>
<9, 7>: <9, 0, 7> and <9, 2, 7> and <9, 4, 7> and <9, 6, 7> and <9, 8, 7>
<9, 8>: <9, 2, 8> and <9, 3, 8> and <9, 4, 8> and <9, 6, 8> and <9, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles is 17, and the unique triangles found are:
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 2, 9>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 4, 6>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 2, 7>
<9, 4, 7>
<9, 6, 7>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 2, 8>
<9, 3, 8>

Therefore, the answer is [17].
