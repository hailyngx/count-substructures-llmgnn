Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
9: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:

0 (1) - 1 connection
2 (2) - 2 connections
3 (3) - 2 connections
4 (4) - 3 connections
5 (5) - 3 connections
6 (6) - 3 connections
7 (7) - 1 connection
8 (8) - 1 connection
9 (9) - 6 connections

Now, we will follow the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 9): Both 0 and 9 have fewer connections than the other, so we proceed.
    - 0 and 9 share connections 1 and 3, forming the triangle <0, 1, 3>.

- Edge (2, 6): Both 2 and 6 have 2 connections, but 2 has a lower label, so we proceed.
    - 2 and 6 share connection 5, forming the triangle <2, 5, 6>.

- Edge (2, 8): Proceeding is not required as 2 has more connections than 8.

- Edge (3, 9): 3 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    - 3 and 9 share connections 1 and 4, forming the triangle <3, 1, 4>.

- Edge (4, 7): Proceeding is not required as 4 has the same number of connections as 7 but a higher label.

- Edge (4, 9): 4 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    - 4 and 9 share connections 1 and 3, forming the triangle <4, 1, 3>.

- Edge (5, 6): 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    - 5 and 6 share connection 2, forming the triangle <5, 2, 6>.

- Edge (5, 9): 5 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    - 5 and 9 share connection 3 and 1, forming the triangle <5, 3, 1>.

- Edge (6, 2): Proceeding is not required as 6 has the same number of connections as 2 but a higher label.

- Edge (6, 5): Proceeding is not required as 6 has the same number of connections as 5 but a higher label.

- Edge (7, 4): 7 has fewer connections, so we proceed.
    - 7 and 4 share no common connections.

- Edge (8, 2): Proceeding is not required as 8 has more connections than 2.

- Edge (9, 0): Proceeding is not required as 9 has more connections than 0.

- Edge (9, 3): 9 has more connections, so we proceed.
    - 9 and 3 share connections 1 and 4, forming the triangle <9, 1, 4>.

- Edge (9, 4): 9 has more connections, so we proceed.
    - 9 and 4 share connections 1 and 3, forming the triangle <9, 1, 3>.

- Edge (9, 5): 9 has more connections, so we proceed.
    - 9 and 5 share connections 3 and 1, forming the triangle <9, 3, 1>.

After counting all possible triangles, the total number of triangles in the given graph is highlighted within brackets as follows: [6].
