Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have:
Nodes by degree: [0(1), 7(1), 2(1), 4(2), 5(2), 7(2), 9(3), 1(4), 3(4), 6(4)]

This results in the following relabeled edges:
(0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. (1, 5): Shared connection with node 0 forms triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. (1, 8): Shared connection with nodes 3 and 9 forms triangles <1, 3, 8> and <1, 8, 9>.
3. (2, 9): No triangles formed.
4. (3, 5): No triangles formed.
5. (3, 6): Shared connection with node 4 forms triangle <3, 4, 6>.
6. (3, 8): No triangles formed.
7. (4, 6): No triangles formed.
8. (4, 7): No triangles formed.
9. (5, 1): Shared connection with node 0 forms triangle <0, 1, 5>.
10. (5, 3): No triangles formed.
11. (6, 3): Shared connection with node 4 forms triangle <3, 4, 6>.
12. (6, 4): No triangles formed.
13. (6, 9): Shared connection with node 8 forms triangle <6, 8, 9>.
14. (7, 4): No triangles formed.
15. (8, 1): Shared connection with nodes 0, 3, and 9 forms triangles <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, and <1, 8, 9>.
16. (8, 3): Shared connection with nodes 1 and 9 forms triangles <1, 3, 8> and <3, 6, 8>.
17. (8, 9): Shared connection with nodes 1, 3, and 6 forms triangles <1, 8, 9> and <3, 6, 8>.
18. (9, 2): No triangles formed.
19. (9, 6): Shared connection with node 8 forms triangle <6, 8, 9>.
20. (9, 8): Shared connection with nodes 1 and 3 forms triangles <1, 8, 9> and <3, 6, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, and <6, 8, 9>.
