Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections and relabeling them, the new order is: 
Nodes with labels in increasing order of connections: 1(1), 0(2), 3(2), 9(4), 8(4), 5(4), 4(4), 6(4), 7(5), 2(5).

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles by examining each edge and checking for shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 6, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 8, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 7>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 6, 5>
<7, 9, 5>

Total number of triangles: [15]
