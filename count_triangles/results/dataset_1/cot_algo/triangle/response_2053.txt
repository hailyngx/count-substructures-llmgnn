Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 5: 6 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. For edge (0, 2):
   Both nodes have 2 connections.
   No triangles are formed.

2. For edge (0, 9):
   Node 0 has 2 connections, and node 9 has 4 connections.
   No triangles are formed.

3. For edge (1, 4):
   Both nodes have 3 connections.
   No triangles are formed.

4. For edge (1, 5):
   Node 1 has 3 connections, and node 5 has 6 connections.
   Triangle <1, 5, 9> is formed.

5. For edge (1, 9):
   Node 1 has 3 connections, and node 9 has 4 connections.
   No triangles are formed.

6. For edge (2, 4):
   Node 2 has 6 connections, and node 4 has 4 connections.
   Triangle <2, 4, 5> is formed.
   Triangle <2, 4, 1> is formed.

7. For edge (2, 5):
   Node 2 has 6 connections, and node 5 has 6 connections.
   Triangle <2, 5, 4> is formed.

8. For edge (2, 6):
   Node 2 has 6 connections, and node 6 has 5 connections.
   Triangle <2, 6, 3> is formed.
   Triangle <2, 6, 7> is formed.

9. For edge (3, 5):
   Node 3 has 4 connections, and node 5 has 6 connections.
   Triangle <3, 5, 4> is formed.

10. For edge (3, 6):
    Node 3 has 4 connections, and node 6 has 5 connections.
    Triangle <3, 6, 2> is formed.
    Triangle <3, 6, 7> is formed.

The total number of triangles is [9].
Unique triangles found are: <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 6, 3>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 6, 2>, <3, 6, 7>.
