Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
- Node 5 is connected to 1 node.
- Nodes 7, 8, and 9 are connected to 2 nodes each.
- Nodes 2 and 4 are connected to 3 nodes each.
- Nodes 1 and 3 are connected to 4 nodes each.
- Node 0 is connected to 6 nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 8 nodes.

Next, we will relabel the nodes accordingly: 
- Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 0
- Nodes 7, 8, 9 (2 connections each) -> Nodes 1, 2, 3
- Nodes 2, 4 (3 connections each) -> Nodes 4, 5
- Nodes 1, 3 (4 connections each) -> Nodes 6, 7
- Node 0 (6 connections) -> Node 8
- Node 6 (8 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle <6, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
