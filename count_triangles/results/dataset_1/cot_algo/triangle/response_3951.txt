Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 4 has 1 connection.  
Nodes 7 and 2 have 3 connections.  
Nodes 5 and 9 have 4 connections.  
Nodes 1 and 8 have 5 connections.  
Node 3 has 6 connections.

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the node with the lower label to find triangles. 

Checking edge (0, 2): No triangles.  
Checking edge (1, 3): Triangle found: <1, 3, 6>.  
Checking edge (1, 5): Triangle found: <1, 5, 6>.  
Checking edge (1, 6): Triangle found: <1, 6, 5>.  
Checking edge (1, 7): No triangles.  
Checking edge (2, 6): Triangle found: <2, 6, 1>.  
Checking edge (3, 6): Triangle found: <3, 6, 1>.  
Checking edge (3, 8): Triangle found: <3, 8, 9>.  
Checking edge (3, 9): Triangle found: <3, 9, 8>.  
Checking edge (4, 6): No triangles.  
Checking edge (5, 6): Triangle found: <5, 6, 1>.  
Checking edge (5, 7): No triangles.  
Checking edge (5, 9): Triangle found: <5, 9, 3>.  
Checking edge (6, 7): No triangles.  
Checking edge (6, 8): No triangles.  
Checking edge (6, 9): No triangles.  
Checking edge (7, 8): No triangles.  
Checking edge (8, 9): No triangles.

From the above checks, the total number of triangles in the graph is found to be [7].
