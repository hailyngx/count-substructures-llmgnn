Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
1. Node 3 (degree 2)
2. Node 5 (degree 2)
3. Node 1 (degree 2)
4. Node 4 (degree 3)
5. Node 6 (degree 4)
6. Node 0 (degree 5)
7. Node 8 (degree 5)
8. Node 7 (degree 6)
9. Node 2 (degree 7)
10. Node 9 (degree 7)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge to count the number of triangles.

Number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
