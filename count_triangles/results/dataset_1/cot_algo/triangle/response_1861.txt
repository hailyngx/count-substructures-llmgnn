Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph with 10 nodes is as follows:
Node degrees:  
Node 0: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 0  
Node 2: degree 4  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 5: degree 1  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 7: degree 0  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 3  
      
Sorted nodes based on degrees: 1, 7, 5, 6, 4, 0, 3, 8, 9, 2 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

(0, 3) - Check shared connection between 3 and 0. Shared connection: None
(0, 6) - Check shared connection between 6 and 0. Shared connection: None
(0, 9) - Check shared connection between 9 and 0. Shared connection: None
(2, 3) - Check shared connection between 3 and 2. Shared connection: None
(2, 4) - Check shared connection between 4 and 2. Shared connection: None
(2, 8) - Check shared connection between 8 and 2. Shared connection: None
(3, 0) - Check shared connection between 0 and 3. Shared connection: None
(3, 2) - Check shared connection between 2 and 3. Shared connection: None
(4, 2) - Check shared connection between 2 and 4. Shared connection: None
(4, 5) - Check shared connection between 5 and 4. Shared connection: None
(5, 4) - Check shared connection between 4 and 5. Shared connection: None
(6, 0) - Check shared connection between 0 and 6. Shared connection: None
(8, 2) - Check shared connection between 2 and 8. Shared connection: None
(8, 9) - Check shared connection between 9 and 8. Shared connection: None
(9, 0) - Check shared connection between 0 and 9. Shared connection: None
(9, 8) - Check shared connection between 8 and 9. Shared connection: None

Based on the analysis, the total number of triangles is [0]. 
The unique triangles found are: None.
