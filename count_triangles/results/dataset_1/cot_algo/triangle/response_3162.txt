Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices ordered by their number of connections are: 
Node 2 (degree 1)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 3)
Node 1 (degree 3)
Node 9 (degree 5)
Node 3 (degree 5)
Node 0 (degree 5)
Node 7 (degree 6)
Node 6 (degree 7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections: 
- Edge (0, 6): shared connections with 1 and 3, forming triangles <0, 1, 6> and <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (0, 7): no triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 9): shared connection with 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (1, 3): no triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 6): shared connection with 5, forming triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 8): no triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): no triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): no triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 6): shared connection with 0 and 7, forming triangle <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (3, 7): shared connection with 0 and 6, forming triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (4, 5): no triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 6): shared connection with 0 and 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (4, 8): no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 4): no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 9): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (6, 0): shared connection with 1, 3, 4, and 7, forming triangle <1, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, and <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (6, 1): shared connection with 5, forming triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 3): shared connection with 0 and 7, forming triangle <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (6, 4): shared connection with 0 and 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (6, 7): shared connection with 0 and 3, forming triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (6, 9): shared connection with 0 and 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (7, 0): shared connection with 3, 6, and 9, forming triangle <0, 3, 7> and <0, 6, 7>.
- Edge (7, 2): no triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 3): shared connection with 0 and 6, forming triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 6): shared connection with 0 and 3, forming triangle <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (7, 9): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (8, 1): no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 4): no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 9): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 0): shared connection with 5, forming triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 5): no triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 7): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 8): shared connection with 0, forming triangle <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 6>.
