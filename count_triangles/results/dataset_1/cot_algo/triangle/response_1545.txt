Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
By using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices in decreasing order of connections:
2, 7, 8, 0, 2, 8, 5, 7, 6, 7

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertex 2 --> 0
Vertex 7 --> 1
Vertex 8 --> 2
Vertex 0 --> 3
Vertex 2 --> 4
Vertex 8 --> 5
Vertex 5 --> 6
Vertex 7 --> 7
Vertex 6 --> 8
Vertex 7 --> 9

Now, we will list the edges that we will consider:
(2, 4), (5, 8), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 9), (2, 4), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (9, 1), (9, 6)

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. Triangle: <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
