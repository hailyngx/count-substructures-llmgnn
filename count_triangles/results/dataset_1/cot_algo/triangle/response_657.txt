Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
We will first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
1. 4 (degree 2)
2. 7 (degree 2)
3. 1 (degree 2)
4. 3 (degree 2)
5. 9 (degree 3)
6. 7 (degree 4)
7. 0 (degree 5)
8. 5 (degree 5)
9. 8 (degree 5)
10. 2 (degree 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

1. Node 4 (degree 2)
2. Node 7 (degree 2)
3. Node 1 (degree 2)
4. Node 3 (degree 2)
5. Node 9 (degree 3)
6. Node 6 (degree 4)
7. Node 0 (degree 5)
8. Node 5 (degree 5)
9. Node 8 (degree 5)
10. Node 2 (degree 5)

Next, we will examine the edges while taking the lower labeled node to find triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Check shared connections: 8. Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>
2. Edge (0, 6): Check shared connections: None.
3. Edge (0, 8): Check shared connections: 2. Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>
4. Edge (0, 9): Check shared connections: None.
5. Edge (1, 2): Check shared connections: None.
6. Edge (1, 9): Check shared connections: None.
7. Edge (2, 1): Check shared connections: None.
8. Edge (2, 3): Check shared connections: None.
9. Edge (3, 2): Check shared connections: None.
10. Edge (3, 8): Check shared connections: None.
11. Edge (4, 5): Check shared connections: None.
12. Edge (4, 6): Check shared connections: None.
13. Edge (5, 4): Check shared connections: None.
14. Edge (5, 6): Check shared connections: None.
15. Edge (5, 7): Check shared connections: None.
16. Edge (5, 8): Check shared connections: 0. Triangle found: <0, 5, 8>
17. Edge (5, 9): Check shared connections: None.
18. Edge (6, 0): Check shared connections: None.
19. Edge (6, 4): Check shared connections: None.
20. Edge (6, 5): Check shared connections: None.
21. Edge (6, 7): Check shared connections: None.
22. Edge (6, 8): Check shared connections: 0. Triangle found: <0, 6, 8>
23. Edge (7, 5): Check shared connections: None.
24. Edge (7, 6): Check shared connections: None.
25. Edge (8, 0): Check shared connections: 2. Triangle found: <0, 2, 8>
26. Edge (8, 3): Check shared connections: None.
27. Edge (8, 5): Check shared connections: 0. Triangle found: <0, 5, 8>
28. Edge (8, 6): Check shared connections: 0. Triangle found: <0, 6, 8>
29. Edge (9, 0): Check shared connections: None.
30. Edge (9, 1): Check shared connections: None.
31. Edge (9, 5): Check shared connections: None.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, and <0, 6, 8>.
