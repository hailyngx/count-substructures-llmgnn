Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: 1 connection  
Node 6: 2 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 7: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 4: 3 connections  
Node 8: 3 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on the sorting:

Node 3 -> Node 0  
Node 6 -> Node 1  
Node 1 -> Node 2  
Node 7 -> Node 3  
Node 9 -> Node 4  
Node 0 -> Node 5  
Node 4 -> Node 6  
Node 8 -> Node 7  
Node 2 -> Node 8  
Node 5 -> Node 9  

Next, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 2): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connection with Node 4 forms a triangle: <0, 4, 6>.
- Edge (1, 4): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (2, 8): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (4, 7): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with Node 5 forms a triangle: <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (5, 6): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (5, 9): Check for shared connections, no triangles.
- Edge (6, 8): Check for shared connections, no triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>
