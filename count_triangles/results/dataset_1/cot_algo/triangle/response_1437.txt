Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 2: Degree 1
Vertex 3: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 5
Vertex 8: Degree 4

Now we will count the triangles:
For edge (1, 2):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 2, 3>

For edge (1, 3):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 2, 3>

For edge (1, 7):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 3 and 4.
    Shared connection: 3
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 3, 7>

For edge (2, 1):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (3, 1):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (3, 7):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 3 and 4.
    Shared connection: 3
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 3, 7>

For edge (4, 6):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (4, 7):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (5, 8):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (6, 4):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (6, 8):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (7, 1):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (7, 3):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (7, 4):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 6 and 7.
    Shared connection: 4
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 4, 7>

For edge (7, 8):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 5, 6, and 7.
    Shared connection: 7
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 7, 8>

For edge (8, 5):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (8, 6):
    Skip as the condition "the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections" is not satisfied.

For edge (8, 7):
    Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 2 and 3.
    Vertex 7 has connections with vertices 3 and 4.
    Shared connection: 7
    Thus, Triangle: <1, 7, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>.
