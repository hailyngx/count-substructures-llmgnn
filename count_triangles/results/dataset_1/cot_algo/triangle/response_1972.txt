Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following list: 

Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 5: 3 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge carefully.
1. (0, 3) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
2. (0, 8) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
3. (1, 2) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
4. (1, 8) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
5. (2, 6) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
6. (2, 7) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
7. (3, 0) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
8. (3, 4) will not form a triangle because node 4 has a higher degree than node 3.
   Shared connection: Node 9
9. (3, 9) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
10. (4, 3) will not form a triangle because node 3 has a higher degree than node 4.
    Shared connection: Node 9
11. (4, 5) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
12. (5, 4) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
13. (5, 7) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
14. (6, 2) will not form a triangle because node 2 has a higher degree than node 6.
    Shared connection: Node 9
15. (6, 9) will not form a triangle because node 9 has a higher degree than node 6.
    Shared connection: Node 3, Node 4
16. (7, 2) will not form a triangle because node 2 has a higher degree than node 7.
    Shared connection: Node 5
17. (7, 5) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
18. (8, 0) will not form a triangle because node 0 has a higher degree than node 8.
    Shared connection: Node 1
19. (8, 1) will not form a triangle because node 1 has a higher degree than node 8.
    Shared connection: Node 2
20. (9, 3) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
21. (9, 4) will not form a triangle because both nodes have the same degree.
22. (9, 6) will not form a triangle because node 9 has a higher degree than node 6.
    Shared connection: Node 3, Node 4

In total, we have found 4 triangles.
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The triangles are: <3, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 5>, <1, 2, 8>.
