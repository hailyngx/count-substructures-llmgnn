Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices in the Degree-Based Ordering would be: 

Node 10 with 0 connections  
Node 5 with 1 connection  
Node 4 with 1 connection  
Node 8 with 1 connection  
Node 9 with 1 connection  
Node 3 with 2 connections  
Node 7 with 2 connections  
Node 6 with 3 connections  
Node 1 with 4 connections  
Node 2 with 5 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we can count the triangles:

1. Checking edge (1, 2):  
   Node 1 and Node 2 share connections with Node 6, forming a triangle <1, 2, 6>.

2. Checking edge (1, 6):  
   There are no triangles.

3. Checking edge (1, 7):  
   There are no triangles.

4. Checking edge (2, 1):  
   We have already counted this edge.

5. Checking edge (2, 3):  
   There are no triangles.

6. Checking edge (2, 4):  
   There are no triangles.

7. Checking edge (2, 5):  
   There are no triangles.

8. Checking edge (3, 2):  
   There are no triangles.

9. Checking edge (3, 6):  
   There are no triangles.

10. Checking edge (4, 2):  
   There are no triangles.

11. Checking edge (5, 2):  
   There are no triangles.

12. Checking edge (6, 1):  
   We have already counted this edge.

13. Checking edge (6, 3):  
   There are no triangles.

14. Checking edge (6, 8):  
   There are no triangles.

15. Checking edge (7, 1):  
   We have already counted this edge.

16. Checking edge (7, 9):  
   There are no triangles.

17. Checking edge (8, 6):  
   There are no triangles.

18. Checking edge (9, 7):  
   There are no triangles.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 6>.
