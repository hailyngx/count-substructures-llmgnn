Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling will be as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 6

Now, we can count the triangles by looking at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using the degree-based ordering method, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 5>.
