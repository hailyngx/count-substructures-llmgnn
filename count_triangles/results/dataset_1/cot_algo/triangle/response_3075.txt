Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by number of connections:
1. Node 1 - degree 1
2. Node 3 - degree 1
3. Node 7 - degree 2
4. Node 8 - degree 2
5. Node 4 - degree 3
6. Node 1 - degree 4
7. Node 0 - degree 4
8. Node 8 - degree 4
9. Node 3 - degree 4
10. Node 6 - degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method with the given edges, we can count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (0, 6): No triangles are formed.
2. For edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.
3. For edge (0, 9): Triangle formed: <0, 6, 9>.
4. For edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed.
5. For edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
6. For edge (4, 5): No triangles are formed.
7. For edge (4, 8): Triangle formed: <4, 8, 5>.
8. For edge (5, 1): No triangles are formed.
9. For edge (5, 4): Triangle formed: <5, 8, 4>.
10. For edge (5, 6): Triangle formed: <5, 0, 6>.
11. For edge (5, 7): No triangles are formed.
12. For edge (6, 0): No triangles are formed.
13. For edge (6, 5): Triangle formed: <6, 0, 5>.
14. For edge (6, 9): Triangle formed: <6, 0, 9>.
15. For edge (7, 0): No triangles are formed.
16. For edge (7, 5): No triangles are formed.
17. For edge (8, 4): No triangles are formed.
18. For edge (8, 9): No triangles are formed.
19. For edge (9, 0): Triangle formed: <9, 6, 0>.
20. For edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed.
21. For edge (9, 6): Triangle formed: <9, 0, 6>.
22. For edge (9, 8): No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Triangles found: <0, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 5>, <5, 0, 6>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 9>, <9, 0, 6>.
