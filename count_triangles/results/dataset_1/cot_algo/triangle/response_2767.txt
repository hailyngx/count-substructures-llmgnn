Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 7: Degree 6
- Node 3: Degree 7

Now, going through each edge where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections, we can list the triangles formed:
1. <0, 4, 2>
2. <0, 4, 5>
3. <0, 4, 7>
4. <0, 5, 2>
5. <0, 5, 6>
6. <0, 7, 3>
7. <2, 4, 5>
8. <4, 5, 6>
9. <1, 3, 6>
10. <1, 6, 2>
11. <1, 6, 3>
12. <1, 6, 7>
13. <2, 5, 6>
14. <5, 6, 7>
15. <5, 6, 3>
16. <8, 2, 4>
17. <9, 3, 7>
18. <9, 3, 6>
19. <4, 6, 7>
20. <4, 6, 3>
21. <5, 6, 7>
22. <5, 6, 3>

Therefore, there are a total of [22] triangles in the given graph.
