Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 9, 8, 5, 4, 2, 1, 5, 0, 7, 6.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <0, 7, 6>
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <1, 6, 4>
- Edge (2, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <2, 3, 5>
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 3, 5>.
