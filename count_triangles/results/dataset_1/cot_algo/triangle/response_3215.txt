Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 2: 5 edges

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order: (1, 2), (4, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (5, 0), (6, 3), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (6, 5), (6, 7), (9, 8), (2, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 6), (3, 9), (5, 9).

After checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
