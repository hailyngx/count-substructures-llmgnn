Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
Vertex 0 has 2 connections,
Vertex 1 has 2 connections,
Vertex 5 has 1 connection,
Vertices 2 and 7 have 3 connections each,
Vertices 4 and 8 have 4 connections each,
Vertices 3, 6, and 9 have 5 connections each.

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph and counting the triangles, we find:
[15] total triangles.
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 8>.
