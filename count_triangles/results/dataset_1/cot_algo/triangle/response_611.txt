Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections):
- Vertex 3: degree 0
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertices 6, 8: degree 3
- Vertices 2, 5, 7: degree 4
- Vertices 0, 4, 9: degree 6

Next, we will label the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 3: 0
- Vertex 1: 1
- Vertices 6, 8: 2
- Vertices 2, 5, 7: 3
- Vertices 0, 4, 9: 4

Now, we will check the edges following the rule that the vertex with the lower label should have fewer connections:
- (1, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 <1, 4, 0>
- (1, 7): No triangle
- (2, 4): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 <2, 4, 0>
- (8, 6): No triangle
- (5, 8): No triangle
- (9, 6): No triangle

Count of triangles = 2

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <1, 4, 0> and <2, 4, 0>.
