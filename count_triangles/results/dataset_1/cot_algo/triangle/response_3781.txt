Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
Nodes: 4 1 0 3 5 9 6 2 8 7

Based on the given edges and the vertex labels, we can find the triangles as follows:
- Triangle with vertices 2, 7, 8
- Triangle with vertices 3, 6, 8

[Total number of triangles: 2]
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
