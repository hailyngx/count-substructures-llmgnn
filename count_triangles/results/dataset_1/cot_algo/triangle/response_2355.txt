Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Sorted vertices by their degree:
0: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
4: 4 connections
6: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
5: 5 connections
1: 6 connections
3: 6 connections

Starting from the edge with the vertex of lower label and fewer connections:
(0, 7): share a connection with vertex 3
(1, 3): share connections with vertices 4 and 5
(1, 4): share a connection with vertex 5
(1, 5): share a connection with vertex 6
(1, 6): share a connection with vertex 5
(1, 8): no triangle
(2, 5): no triangle
(3, 4): share a connection with vertex 5
(3, 5): share a connection with vertices 1 and 6
(3, 7): share a connection with vertex 0
(3, 9): share a connection with vertices 5 and 6
(4, 5): share a connection with vertex 1
(5, 6): share a connection with vertex 1
(5, 9): share a connection with vertex 3
(6, 9): share a connection with vertex 3

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [13] and the unique triangles found are: 
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
