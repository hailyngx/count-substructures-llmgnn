Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 1, 8, 5, 9, 3, 1, 6, 7, 0, 2. 

The edges to consider based on the vertex ordering are: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (2, 7), (2, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 9).

After examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
