Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree, from least to most connections:
Vertex 2: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections

Now, let's go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. (0, 1) - Vertex 0 and 1 share a connection with Vertex 7, forming a triangle. <0, 1, 7>
2. (0, 2) - No triangles formed.
3. (0, 7) - No triangles formed.
4. (1, 0) - Already counted.
5. (1, 7) - Already counted.
6. (1, 8) - No triangles formed.
7. (2, 0) - No triangles formed.
8. (3, 7) - No triangles formed.
9. (4, 7) - No triangles formed.
10. (6, 8) - No triangles formed.
11. (6, 9) - No triangles formed.
12. (7, 0) - No triangles formed.
13. (7, 1) - Already counted.
14. (7, 3) - No triangles formed.
15. (7, 4) - No triangles formed.
16. (7, 9) - No triangles formed.
17. (8, 1) - No triangles formed.
18. (8, 6) - No triangles formed.
19. (9, 6) - No triangles formed.
20. (9, 7) - No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>
