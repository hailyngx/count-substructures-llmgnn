Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by the number of connections they have:

0 -> 2 connections
1 -> 3 connections
5 -> 2 connections
6 -> 4 connections
8 -> 2 connections
4 -> 2 connections
7 -> 4 connections
2 -> 3 connections
3 -> 3 connections
9 -> 6 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

0 -> 0
1 -> 1
5 -> 2
6 -> 3
8 -> 4
4 -> 5
7 -> 6
2 -> 7
3 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Considering edge (0, 3): Check for shared connections between 0 and 3: (0, 8, 9) -> Triangle <0, 3, 9>
Considering edge (0, 8) (Skipped since 0 has 2 connections and 8 has 2 connections)
Considering edge (1, 2) (Skipped since 1 has 3 connections and 2 has 3 connections)
Considering edge (1, 4): Check for shared connections between 1 and 4: (1, 9, 7) -> Triangle <1, 4, 9>
...
(Continue similarly for other edges)

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [19]. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 9, 6>
<8, 0, 9>
