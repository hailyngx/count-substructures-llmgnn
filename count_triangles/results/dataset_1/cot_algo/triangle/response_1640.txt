Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is:  
Vertex 0 has 2 connections  
Vertex 4 has 0 connections  
Vertex 8 has 0 connections  
Vertex 1 has 3 connections  
Vertex 6 has 3 connections  
Vertex 2 has 4 connections  
Vertex 7 has 4 connections  
Vertex 3 has 4 connections  
Vertex 5 has 4 connections  
Vertex 9 has 4 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles by following the described procedure.  

There are 9 unique triangles in this graph:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 2, 5>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 6, 9>  
<2, 3, 7>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<3, 5, 7>  
<5, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
