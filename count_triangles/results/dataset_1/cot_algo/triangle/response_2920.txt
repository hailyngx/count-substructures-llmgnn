Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees from least to most:

Nodes sorted by degree:
2 (degree: 2)
5 (degree: 3)
6 (degree: 3)
4 (degree: 4)
7 (degree: 4)
1 (degree: 4)
3 (degree: 4)
8 (degree: 5)
0 (degree: 5)
9 (degree: 5)

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Node 3 doesn't have fewer connections than node 0, so we skip this edge.

For edge (0, 4):
Shared connections with node 0 and node 4: 8
This forms a triangle with nodes 0, 4, and 8.

For edge (0, 7):
Node 7 doesn't have fewer connections than node 0, so we skip this edge.

For edge (0, 8):
Shared connections with node 0 and node 8: 4
This forms a triangle with nodes 0, 4, and 8.

The total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 8>.
