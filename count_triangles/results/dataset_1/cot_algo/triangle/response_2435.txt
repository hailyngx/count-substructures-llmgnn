Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree in ascending order:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 7, 5, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 8, 8, 6

Next, we will relabel the nodes according to their sorted order:
Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now we will list the triangles found:
[7]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
