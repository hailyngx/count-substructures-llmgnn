Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the new order of vertices is: 
Vertices: 3, 7, 0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 8, 9 

Now, let's find the triangles in the graph: 
- For edge (0, 1): Shared connection with vertex 8 forms a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- For edge (0, 8): No triangles.
- For edge (1, 2): No triangles.
- For edge (1, 4): Shared connection with vertex 5 forms a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- For edge (2, 7): No triangles.
- For edge (2, 9): No triangles.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangles.
- For edge (4, 5): No triangles.
- For edge (5, 8): Shared connection with vertex 9 forms a triangle <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
