Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees and then counting triangles. 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 3
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 1

Based on their degrees, the sorted vertices are: 9, 0, 4, 2, 8, 3, 6, 7, 1.

Now, we will count the triangles by starting with the vertex with the least degree and checking its connections with higher-degree vertices.

Total number of triangles: [18]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 8, 6>, <8, 7, 1>, <8, 7, 6>.
