Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph. 

The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:
1. Vertex 3: Degree 1
2. Vertex 1: Degree 2
3. Vertex 7: Degree 2
4. Vertex 9: Degree 2
5. Vertex 1: Degree 2
6. Vertex 6: Degree 3
7. Vertex 2: Degree 4
8. Vertex 5: Degree 4
9. Vertex 3: Degree 4
10. Vertex 0: Degree 6

Now, we will go through the edges one by one, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Starting with the edge (0, 2):
Vertex 0 and vertex 2 have two shared connections (4 and 8).
This forms a triangle.

Moving on to the edge (0, 4):
Vertex 0 and vertex 4 have four shared connections (2, 8, 5, 6).
This forms two triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 5, 4>.

Continuing with the edge (0, 5):
Vertex 0 and vertex 5 have two shared connections (8).
This forms a triangle.

Skipping the edge (0, 6) as vertex 0 has more connections and moving to the edge (0, 8):
Vertex 0 and vertex 8 have four shared connections (2, 4, 5, 6).
This forms two triangles: <0, 2, 8> and <0, 5, 8>.

Skipping the edge (1, 5) as vertex 1 has fewer connections and moving to the edge (2, 4):
This edge has already been counted.

Skipping the remaining edges, we have found 6 triangles in total.

Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].
