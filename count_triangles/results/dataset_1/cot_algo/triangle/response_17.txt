Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Vertices: 2 → 0 → 8 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 3 → 7 → 1 → 4

Now, we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

There are 11 triangles in total, which can be seen inside brackets: [11].
