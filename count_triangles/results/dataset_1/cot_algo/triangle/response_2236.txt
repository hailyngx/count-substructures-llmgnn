Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices:
0: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 3 connections

We relabel the vertices accordingly:
3 -> 0
4 -> 1
6 -> 2
9 -> 3
5 -> 4
7 -> 5
0 -> 6
2 -> 7
8 -> 8
1 -> 9

Now, we analyze each edge to count the number of triangles:
(0, 1): Shared connections: 8
(0, 3): No triangle
(0, 5): No triangle
(0, 8): Shared connections: 6
(1, 2): Shared connections: 7
(1, 4): No triangle
(1, 7): Shared connections: 5
(1, 8): Shared connections: 9
(1, 9): Shared connections: 3
(2, 5): No triangle
(2, 6): No triangle
(2, 7): Shared connections: 2
(3, 6): No triangle
(4, 6): No triangle
(4, 7): Shared connections: 5
(5, 8): Shared connections: 4
(5, 9): No triangle
(6, 7): Shared connections: 2
(7, 8): Shared connections: 5

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 8, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
