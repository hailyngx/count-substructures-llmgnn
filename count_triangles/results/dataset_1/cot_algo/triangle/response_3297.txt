Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 2 <- 5 <- 9 <- 6 <- 8 <- 3 <- 1 <- 4 <- 0 <- 7

Using this ordering, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [12].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
