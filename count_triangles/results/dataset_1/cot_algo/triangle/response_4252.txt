Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 
Nodes: 2, 6, 4, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0

Based on this ordering, the edges to consider are: (2, 0), (6, 0), (4, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 5), (5, 3), (3, 1), (1, 0)

Calculating the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>

The total number of triangles is [2].
