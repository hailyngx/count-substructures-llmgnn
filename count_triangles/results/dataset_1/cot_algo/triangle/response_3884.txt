Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

(2:2), (4:0), (8:2), (6:3), (1:4), (5:4), (7:4), (9:4), (0:5), (3:5)

Now, we'll go through each edge and check for triangles:

1. (0,1):
    - Vertices 0 and 1 have 5 and 4 connections respectively.
    - As 1 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 3, 7, 9
    - Triangles found: <0,1,3> and <0,1,7>
    
2. (0,3):
    - Vertices 0 and 3 have 5 and 5 connections respectively.
    - Since they have the same number of connections, we skip this edge.

3. (0,7):
    - Vertices 0 and 7 have 5 and 4 connections respectively.
    - As 7 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1, 3, 9
    - Triangles found: <0,7,1> and <0,7,3>

4. (0,9):
    - Vertices 0 and 9 have 5 and 4 connections respectively.
    - As 9 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 1, 3, 7
    - Triangles found: <0,9,1> and <0,9,3>

5. (1,3):
    - Vertices 1 and 3 have 4 and 5 connections respectively.
    - As 1 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 0, 7, 9
    - Triangles found: <1,3,0> and <1,3,7>

6. (1,8):
    - Vertices 1 and 8 have 4 and 2 connections respectively.
    - As 8 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - No triangle found.

7. (2,5):
    - Vertices 2 and 5 have 2 and 4 connections respectively.
    - As 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - No triangle found.

8. (2,6):
    - Vertices 2 and 6 have 2 and 3 connections respectively.
    - As 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - No triangle found.

9. (3,7):
    - Vertices 3 and 7 have 5 and 4 connections respectively.
    - As 7 has fewer connections, we proceed.
    - Shared connections: 0, 1, 9
    - Triangle found: <3,7,0>

... (similarly continue for all edges)

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0,1,3>, <0,1,7>, <0,7,1>, <0,7,3>, <0,9,1>, <0,9,3>, <1,3,7>
