Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 4 connections
- Vertex 1 has 1 connection
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 6 connections
- Vertex 6 has 1 connection
- Vertex 7 has 1 connection
- Vertex 8 has 5 connections
- Vertex 9 has 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <0, 5, 9>
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 4: <0, 8, 4>
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 9, 5>
- Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <3, 8, 0>
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 9: <4, 5, 9>
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 9>, <0, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 0>
