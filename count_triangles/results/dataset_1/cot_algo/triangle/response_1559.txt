Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Then, we can follow the steps outlined in the approach to count the triangles in the given graph.

After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 with 3 connections
- Node 1 with 3 connections
- Node 2 with 2 connections
- Node 3 with 6 connections
- Node 4 with 5 connections
- Node 5 with 1 connection
- Node 6 with 4 connections
- Node 7 with 1 connection
- Node 8 with 5 connections
- Node 9 with 4 connections

Now, let's count the triangles and identify them:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 8>
3. <0, 4, 6>
4. <1, 3, 8>
5. <2, 3, 4>
6. <3, 4, 9>
7. <3, 6, 9>
8. <4, 6, 9>
9. <8, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
