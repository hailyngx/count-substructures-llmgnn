Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we relabel the vertices based on their degree:

Node 0 has 3 connections
Node 1 has 2 connections
Node 2 has 2 connections
Node 3 has 1 connection
Node 4 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections

Sorted Nodes: 3, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 0, 4

Checking edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <0, 4, 7>
Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <0, 7, 4>
Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <1, 4, 0>
Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle.
Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
Edge (4, 1) forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <4, 1, 0>
Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle.
Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 0>, <4, 1, 0>
