Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree:  
Vertices:  
0 -> 3 connections  
1 -> 1 connection  
2 -> 3 connections  
3 -> 1 connection  
4 -> 4 connections  
5 -> 5 connections  
6 -> 1 connection  
7 -> 2 connections  
8 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 1 connection  

Triangles found:  
<[0, 4, 5]>  
<[4, 5, 8]>  

[2] triangles in total.
