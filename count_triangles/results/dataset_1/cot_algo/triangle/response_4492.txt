Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 4 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 6 (Degree 3)
Node 2 (Degree 4)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 5 (Degree 6)
Node 8 (Degree 6)
Node 0 (Degree 7)

Counting triangles:
- For edge (2, 3): Node 3 has connections with nodes 2 and 5. So, we have a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- For edge (2, 4): Node 4 has connections with nodes 2 and 8. So, we have a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
- For edge (1, 5): Node 1 has a connection with node 5. No triangle is formed.
- For edge (6, 7): Node 6 has connections with nodes 5 and 9 but not with node 7. No triangle is formed.
- For edge (2, 5): Node 5 has connections with nodes 2 and 3. So, we have a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- For edge (5, 8): Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. So, we have triangles <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, and <2, 5, 8>.
- For edge (7, 9): Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 6, and 8 but not with node 9. No triangle is formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>.
