Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are: 4, 3, 7, 0, 8, 2, 1, 9, 5, 6.

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 6, 8>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
