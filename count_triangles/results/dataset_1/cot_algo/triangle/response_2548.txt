Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices with their corresponding number of connections are:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 6 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most:
- Vertex 6: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 9: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (2, 6): No triangle
- Edge (8, 5): No triangle
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle
- Edge (6, 7): No triangle
- Edge (0, 5): Triangle <0, 5, 1>
- Edge (9, 2): No triangle
- Edge (9, 7): No triangle
- Edge (6, 2): No triangle
- Edge (3, 9): Triangle <3, 9, 4>
- Edge (7, 0): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 1>, <3, 9, 4>
