Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0: degree 5
Node 7: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 2: degree 6

Following the degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 2, 0>
<4, 5, 9>
