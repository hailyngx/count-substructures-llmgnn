Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
```
Vertex 1: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
```

Next, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Triangles:
- (0, 2, 8)
- (0, 5, 7)
- (0, 8, 3)
- (0, 8, 5)
- (2, 5, 7)
- (2, 7, 5)
- (3, 6, 8)
- (4, 5, 6)
- (4, 5, 9)
- (5, 7, 2)
- (5, 7, 8)
- (5, 8, 0)
- (5, 8, 3)
- (5, 8, 7)
- (6, 3, 8)
- (6, 4, 5)
- (7, 2, 5)
- (8, 0, 5)
- (8, 3, 6)
- (8, 3, 5)

Total number of triangles: [20]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 3>
<0, 8, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 4, 5>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 3, 5>
