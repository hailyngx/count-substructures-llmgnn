Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree of connection, the new ordering is:  
Node 5 - Degree 0  
Nodes 6 and 9 - Degree 1  
Nodes 1 and 3 - Degree 2  
Nodes 0, 7, and 8 - Degree 3  
Node 2 - Degree 4  
The triangles formed by the given edges are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<2, 4, 8>  

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
