Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph with vertices sorted by number of connections:
Nodes: 0, 4, 9, 3, 5, 9, 1, 8, 6, 7

Edges in sorted order:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (6, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 9)

Count of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 5>, <6, 3, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 8, 9>
