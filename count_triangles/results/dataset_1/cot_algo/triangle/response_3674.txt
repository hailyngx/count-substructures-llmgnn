Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the vertices will be relabeled as follows: 

Node 5, Node 7, Node 2, Node 8, Node 4, Node 1, Node 0, Node 6, Node 3, Node 9

Now, examining each edge, the triangles formed are as follows:

<4, 1, 0>
<6, 1, 3>
<6, 1, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
