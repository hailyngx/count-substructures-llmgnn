Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 5
- Vertex 8: degree 5

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

- Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 4 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 1 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 0 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 2 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 9 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 8 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 9

Now, we will find the triangles by examining each edge:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 9>
- Triangle 5: <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle 6: <1, 5, 9>
- Triangle 7: <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle 8: <3, 4, 9>
- Triangle 9: <3, 5, 1>
- Triangle 10: <3, 5, 9>
- Triangle 11: <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
