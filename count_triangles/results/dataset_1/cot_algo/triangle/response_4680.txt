Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 1
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges.

Starting with the edge (0, 4), as 0 has fewer connections than 4, and they share 7 as a common connection, we find the triangle: <0, 4, 7>.

Moving to the edge (0, 7), as 0 has fewer connections than 7, and they share 4 as a common connection, we find the triangle: <0, 7, 4>.

For the edge (0, 9), as 0 has fewer connections than 9, and they share 1 as a common connection, we find the triangle: <0, 9, 1>.

Continuing this process for all edges, we find total of 3 triangles in the graph, which are: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 9, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
