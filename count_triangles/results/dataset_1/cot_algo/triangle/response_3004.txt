Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeling:
Node 0 -> has 1 connection
Node 1 -> has 2 connections
Node 7 -> has 2 connections
Node 5 -> has 3 connections
Node 8 -> has 3 connections
Node 6 -> has 3 connections
Node 9 -> has 3 connections
Node 4 -> has 4 connections
Node 2 -> has 5 connections
Node 3 -> has 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and list them as follows:
Total number of triangles: [12]
