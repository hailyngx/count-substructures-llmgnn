Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following graph with 10 nodes:

```
0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
1: 0, 4, 9
2:
3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
4: 1, 3, 5, 7
5: 0, 3, 4
6: 3, 9
7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
8: 0, 3, 7, 9
9: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
```

Now, we will sort the nodes based on their degree:

Nodes sorted by degree:
```
2:
1: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
0: 6 connections
5: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
8: 4 connections
9: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
3: 6 connections
```

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
```
Node 2 -> Label 0
Node 1 -> Label 1
Node 6 -> Label 2
Node 0 -> Label 3
Node 5 -> Label 4
Node 4 -> Label 5
Node 8 -> Label 6
Node 9 -> Label 7
Node 7 -> Label 8
Node 3 -> Label 9
```

Then we will check for triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Triangles found:
```
Total number of triangles: [3]
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
``` 

Therefore, there are a total of 3 triangles in the given graph.
