Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After reordering the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex order is: 
0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 6, 9, 7

Now, we will analyze the edges in the same order as given:
(0, 5): 0 and 5 have common neighbor 7. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 7>
(0, 7): 0 and 7 have common neighbor 5. Triangle formed: <0, 7, 5>
(0, 8): No triangle formed.
(1, 8): No triangle formed.
(2, 9): No triangle formed.
(4, 7): No triangle formed.
(5, 0): Already counted as part of <0, 5, 7> triangle.
(5, 6): No triangle formed.
(5, 9): No triangle formed.
(6, 5): Already counted as part of <0, 5, 7> triangle.
(6, 7): 6 and 7 have common neighbor 5. Triangle formed: <6, 7, 5>
(7, 0): Already counted as part of <0, 7, 5> triangle.
(7, 4): No triangle formed.
(7, 6): Already counted as part of <6, 7, 5> triangle.
(8, 0): No triangle formed.
(8, 1): No triangle formed.
(9, 2): No triangle formed.
(9, 5): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 7, 5>, and <6, 7, 5>.
