Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): No triangle
3. Edge (1, 4): Triangle <1, 4, 5>
4. Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 9>
5. Edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 9, 5>
6. Edge (2, 0): No triangle
7. Edge (2, 3): No triangle
8. Edge (2, 5): Triangle <2, 5, 9>
9. Edge (2, 9): Triangle <0, 2, 9> and Triangle <2, 9, 4>
10. Edge (3, 2): No triangle
11. Edge (3, 6): No triangle
12. Edge (4, 0): No triangle
13. Edge (4, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 4>
14. Edge (4, 5): Triangle <4, 5, 9>
15. Edge (4, 9): No additional triangle as already counted above
16. Edge (5, 2): No additional triangle as already counted above
17. Edge (5, 4): No additional triangle as already counted above
18. Edge (5, 8): No triangle
19. Edge (6, 1): No additional triangle as already counted above
20. Edge (6, 3): No triangle
21. Edge (6, 9): No additional triangle as already counted above
22. Edge (8, 5): No triangle
23. Edge (9, 1): No additional triangle as already counted above
24. Edge (9, 2): No additional triangle as already counted above
25. Edge (9, 4): No additional triangle as already counted above
26. Edge (9, 5): No additional triangle as already counted above

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
