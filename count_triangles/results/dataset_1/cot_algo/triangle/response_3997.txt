Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Then we relabel the vertices accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their connections:

Node 1: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Next, we check each edge and count the triangles based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [15]
