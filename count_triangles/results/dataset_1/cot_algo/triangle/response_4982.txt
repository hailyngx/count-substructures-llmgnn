Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 1: Degree 2
- Vertex 2: Degree 2
- Vertex 7: Degree 1
- Vertex 8: Degree 1
- Vertex 5: Degree 4
- Vertex 6: Degree 3
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 4: Degree 5
- Vertex 9: Degree 6

Next, we will iterate through the edges based on the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles.

Calculating the triangles:
- (1, 5): None
- (2, 4): None
- (3, 4): <3, 4, 2>
- (3, 5): <3, 5, 1>
- (3, 6): None
- (4, 2): None
- (4, 3): None
- (4, 5): <4, 5, 3>
- (4, 9): <4, 9, 6>, <4, 9, 3>
- (5, 1): None
- (5, 3): None
- (5, 4): None
- (5, 6): <5, 6, 3>
- (6, 3): None
- (6, 5): None
- (6, 9): <6, 9, 4>
- (7, 9): None
- (8, 9): None
- (9, 4): None
- (9, 6): None
- (9, 7): None
- (9, 8): None

Count of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<3, 4, 2>
<3, 5, 1>
<4, 5, 3>
<4, 9, 6>
<4, 9, 3>
<5, 6, 3>
