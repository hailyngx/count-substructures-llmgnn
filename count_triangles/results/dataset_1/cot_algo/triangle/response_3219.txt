Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following mapping:

0 -> 1 connection
1 -> 2 connections
2 -> 1 connection
3 -> 2 connections
4 -> 4 connections
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 1 connection
7 -> 1 connection
8 -> 4 connections
9 -> 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge to count the triangles. 

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 5): No triangles
- For edge (1, 5): Triangle <1, 5, 4>
- For edge (1, 8): No triangles
- For edge (2, 8): No triangles
- For edge (3, 4): No triangles
- For edge (3, 9): No triangles
- For edge (4, 3): No triangles
- For edge (4, 5): No triangles
- For edge (4, 8): No triangles
- For edge (5, 0): No triangles
- For edge (5, 1): Triangle <1, 5, 4>
- For edge (5, 4): Triangle <4, 5, 1>
- For edge (5, 9): Triangle <5, 9, 3>
- For edge (6, 8): No triangles
- For edge (7, 9): No triangles
- For edge (8, 1): No triangles
- For edge (8, 2): No triangles
- For edge (8, 4): Triangle <4, 8, 5>
- For edge (8, 6): No triangles
- For edge (9, 3): No triangles
- For edge (9, 5): Triangle <5, 9, 3>
- For edge (9, 7): No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] within the graph. The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 1>, <5, 9, 3>, <4, 8, 5>.
