Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the labels for the vertices will be as follows:
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 2, 4, and 7 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 5 and 6 have 5 connections each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): No triangles are formed.
2. Edge (0, 6): No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 4): No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (1, 8): No triangles are formed.
6. Edge (2, 0): No triangles are formed.
7. Edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
8. Edge (2, 9): No triangles are formed.
9. Edge (3, 5): No triangles are formed.
10. Edge (3, 6): No triangles are formed.
11. Edge (4, 1): No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (4, 5): Triangle formed: <4, 1, 5>
13. Edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <4, 6, 1>
14. Edge (4, 7): No triangles are formed.
15. Edge (5, 1): No triangles are formed.
16. Edge (5, 3): No triangles are formed.
17. Edge (5, 4): Already counted.
18. Edge (5, 6): Triangle formed: <5, 6, 4>
19. Edge (5, 9): No triangles are formed.
20. Edge (6, 0): No triangles are formed.
21. Edge (6, 3): No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (6, 4): Already counted.
23. Edge (6, 5): Already counted.
24. Edge (6, 7): Triangle formed: <6, 7, 4>
25. Edge (6, 8): No triangles are formed.
26. Edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
27. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.
28. Edge (7, 6): Already counted.
29. Edge (8, 1): No triangles are formed.
30. Edge (8, 6): No triangles are formed.
31. Edge (9, 2): No triangles are formed.
32. Edge (9, 5): No triangles are formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <4, 1, 5>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 4>, <6, 7, 4>
