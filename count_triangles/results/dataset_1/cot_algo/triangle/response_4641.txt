Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 3: 0 connections
- Node 6: 0 connections
- Node 8: 0 connections
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes:
- Node 3: 0 connections -> A
- Node 6: 0 connections -> B
- Node 8: 0 connections -> C
- Node 0: 3 connections -> D
- Node 1: 2 connections -> E
- Node 2: 2 connections -> F
- Node 4: 2 connections -> G
- Node 5: 2 connections -> H
- Node 7: 2 connections -> I
- Node 9: 4 connections -> J

Next, we will analyze the edges based on the lower label:
- (0, 1) -> E(1) and D(0) share 0 connections -> 0 triangles
- (0, 2) -> F(2) and D(0) share 0 connections -> 0 triangles
- (0, 4) -> G(4) and D(0) share 1 connection: 9 -> <0, 4, 9>
- (1, 5) -> E(1) and H(5) share 0 connections -> 0 triangles
- (2, 9) -> F(2) and J(9) share 0 connections -> 0 triangles
- (4, 7) -> G(4) and I(7) share 0 connections -> 0 triangles
- (5, 9) -> H(5) and J(9) share 1 connection: 1 -> <5, 9, 1>
- (7, 9) -> I(7) and J(9) share 1 connection: 0 -> <7, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 9> and <5, 9, 1>.
