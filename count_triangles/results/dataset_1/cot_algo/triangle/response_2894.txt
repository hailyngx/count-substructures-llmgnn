Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks as follows:

Vertices:
0 - degree 2
1 - degree 1
3 - degree 1
7 - degree 2
8 - degree 2
6 - degree 2
5 - degree 3
4 - degree 4
9 - degree 5
2 - degree 6

Now, let's count the number of triangles in the graph using the degree-based ordering method:
[]

In this graph, the total number of triangles is 6. The unique triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
