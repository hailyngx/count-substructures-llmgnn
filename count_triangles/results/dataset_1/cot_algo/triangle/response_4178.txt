Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 1 edge
Node 5: 1 edge
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges

Now, we will relabel the vertices:

Node 1 -> A
Node 5 -> B
Node 0 -> C
Node 2 -> D
Node 6 -> E
Node 3 -> F
Node 7 -> G
Node 8 -> H
Node 4 -> I

Now, we will go through each edge and count triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5): Skipped since 0 already has more connections than 5.
2. Edge (1, 3): Skipped since 1 already has more connections than 3.
3. Edge (2, 8): Skipped since 2 already has more connections than 8.
4. Edge (3, 1): Skipped since 1 already has more connections than 3.
5. Edge (3, 4): Skipped since 4 already has more connections than 3.
6. Edge (4, 3): Skipped since 3 already has more connections than 4.
7. Edge (4, 6): Skipped since 6 already has more connections than 4.
8. Edge (4, 7): Triangle found: <G, I, F>
9. Edge (5, 0): Skipped since 0 already has more connections than 5.
10. Edge (6, 4): Triangle found: <I, E, F>
11. Edge (7, 4): Triangle found: <I, G, F>
12. Edge (7, 8): Skipped since 8 already has more connections than 7.
13. Edge (8, 2): Skipped since 2 already has more connections than 8.
14. Edge (8, 7): Triangle found: <G, H, I>

Total number of triangles: [3]
