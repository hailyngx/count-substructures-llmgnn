Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, we have the following new labels for the nodes: 

Nodes: 1(3), 2(3), 6(3), 9(3), 5(4), 8(4), 7(5), 4(6), 0(7), 3(7)

Starting from the edges with the lower labeled vertices, we analyze each edge to count the triangles.

Triangles:
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 6>
<0, 9, 8>
<3, 2, 7>
<3, 2, 7>

<8, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [19]
