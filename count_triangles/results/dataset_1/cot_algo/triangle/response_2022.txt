Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertices: 1, 7, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 6, 3, 0

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles found:
<1, 0, 3>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 9>

<4, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>

Total number of triangles: [7]
