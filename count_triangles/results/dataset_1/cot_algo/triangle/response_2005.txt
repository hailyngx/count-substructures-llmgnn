Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeled vertices:
Vertex 0: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 0

Since the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections for each edge, let's check for shared connections to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): No triangle
2. Edge (1, 6): Triangle <1, 6, 4>
3. Edge (1, 8): No triangle
4. Edge (2, 0): No triangle
5. Edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 1>
6. Edge (4, 7): No triangle
7. Edge (5, 8): No triangle
8. Edge (6, 1): Triangle <6, 1, 4>
9. Edge (6, 4): Triangle <6, 4, 1>
10. Edge (6, 9): Triangle <6, 9, 4>
11. Edge (7, 4): No triangle
12. Edge (8, 1): No triangle
13. Edge (8, 5): No triangle
14. Edge (9, 6): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 6, 4>, <6, 1, 4>, and <6, 9, 4>.
