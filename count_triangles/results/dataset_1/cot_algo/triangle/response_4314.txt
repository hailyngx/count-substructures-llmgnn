Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 0 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 5 connections

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

0 -> 1
1 -> 4
2 -> 2
3 -> 3
4 -> 0
5 -> 6
6 -> 7
7 -> 5
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

Next, we count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: 12

[12]

Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 9>, <7, 3, 8>, <8, 3, 7>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 7, 9>
