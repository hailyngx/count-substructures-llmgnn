Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start by sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices: 1, 6, 7, 8, 3, 9, 4, 5, 2, 0

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
1 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 3
3 -> 4
9 -> 5
4 -> 6
5 -> 7
2 -> 8
0 -> 9

Next, we will count the number of triangles in the graph:
Number of triangles = 7

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<0, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
