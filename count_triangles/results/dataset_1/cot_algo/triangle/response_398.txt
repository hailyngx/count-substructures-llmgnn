Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 7 is connected to: [4]
Node 0 is connected to: [3, 5]
Node 8 is connected to: [1]
Node 2 is connected to: [3, 5]
Node 6 is connected to: [1, 3]
Node 9 is connected to: [3]
Node 1 is connected to: [3, 6, 8]
Node 5 is connected to: [0, 2, 3, 4]
Node 4 is connected to: [5, 7]
Node 3 is connected to: [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles, we analyze the edges in the following order: 

Checking edge (0, 3): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
Checking edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (1, 3): Forms triangle with node 6. Triangle: <1, 3, 6>
Checking edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (2, 3): Forms triangle with node 5. Triangle: <2, 3, 5>
Checking edge (2, 5): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 0): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 2): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (5, 0): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (5, 2): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (5, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 3>
Checking edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (6, 1): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (8, 1): No triangles formed.
Checking edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <0, 2, 3>
