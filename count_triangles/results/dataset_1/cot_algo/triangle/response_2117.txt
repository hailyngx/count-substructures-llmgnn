Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 4: 8 connections

We will start counting triangles according to the Degree-Based Ordering method.

From the given edges, we observe that one triangle is formed by vertices 0, 2, and 4:
- (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)

There are no other triangles based on the edges provided. Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 1, and the unique triangle found is <0, 2, 4>. 

Thus, the output is [1] with the unique triangle <0, 2, 4>.
