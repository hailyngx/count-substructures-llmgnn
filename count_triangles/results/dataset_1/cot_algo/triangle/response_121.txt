Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 2: 0 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 6 connections
Node 7: 4 connections

Based on the sorted vertices, we can start counting the triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 2]
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 6>
