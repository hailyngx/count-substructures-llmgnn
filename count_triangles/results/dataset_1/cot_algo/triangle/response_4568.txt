Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

Sorted vertices by their number of connections:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 5: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 3: degree 1
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 3

Counting triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connection with node 0: <0, 1, 2>
2. Edge (0, 3): No triangle
3. Edge (0, 6): Shared connection with node 0: <0, 6, 7>
4. Edge (1, 2): Shared connection with node 1: <1, 0, 2>
5. Edge (1, 8): Shared connection with node 1: <1, 8, 7>
6. Edge (2, 6): Shared connection with node 2: <2, 1, 8>
7. Edge (2, 8): Shared connection with node 2: <2, 1, 8>
8. Edge (4, 7): No triangle
9. Edge (4, 9): No triangle
10. Edge (5, 9): No triangle
11. Edge (6, 7): Shared connection with node 6: <6, 0, 7>
12. Edge (6, 9): Shared connection with node 6: <6, 0, 9>
13. Edge (7, 8): Shared connection with node 7: <7, 8, 1>
14. Edge (8, 7): Shared connection with node 8: <8, 1, 7>
15. Edge (9, 4): No triangle
16. Edge (9, 5): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 1, 8>, <6, 0, 7>, <6, 0, 9>, <7, 8, 1>
