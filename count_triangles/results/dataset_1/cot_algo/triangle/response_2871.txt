Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 4 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 3 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection

Now, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 1 connection (Label 0)
- Vertex 1: 1 connection (Label 1)
- Vertex 4: 1 connection (Label 2)
- Vertex 6: 2 connections (Label 3)
- Vertex 9: 1 connection (Label 4)
- Vertex 2: 2 connections (Label 5)
- Vertex 7: 1 connection (Label 6)
- Vertex 8: 3 connections (Label 7)
- Vertex 3: 4 connections (Label 8)

Next, we will examine each edge where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 8): Both 0 and 8 are labeled, and they share a connection at vertex 3 (labeled 8). Hence, there is a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
2. Edge (1, 6): Both 1 and 6 are labeled, and they do not share any common connections.
3. Edge (2, 3): Both 2 and 3 are labeled, and they share a connection at vertex 4 (labeled 5). Hence, there is a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
4. Edge (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 are labeled, and they share a connection at vertex 3 (labeled 8). Hence, there is a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
5. Edge (3, 7): Both 3 and 7 are labeled, but they do not share any common connections.
6. Edge (6, 9): Both 6 and 9 are labeled, and they do not share any common connections.
7. Edge (7, 3): Both 3 and 7 are labeled, but they do not share any common connections.
8. Edge (8, 0): Both 0 and 8 are labeled, and they share a connection at vertex 3 (labeled 8). Hence, there is a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
9. Edge (9, 6): Both 6 and 9 are labeled, and they do not share any common connections.
10. Edge (8, 3): Both 3 and 8 are labeled, and they share connections at vertices 0 (labeled 0) and 2 (labeled 5). Hence, there are two triangles <0, 2, 3> and <3, 8, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and they are: <0, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 4>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 8, 0>. 

Hence, the answer is [4].
