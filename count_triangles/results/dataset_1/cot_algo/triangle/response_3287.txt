Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
Node 3 < Node 9 < Node 5 < Node 6 < Node 4 < Node 7 < Node 1 < Node 2 < Node 0 < Node 8

Edges to consider (in the format of lower label vertex, higher label vertex):
(1, 0), (2, 1), (4, 2), (8, 3), (5, 4), (9, 7), (6, 0), (8, 7), (8, 0)
