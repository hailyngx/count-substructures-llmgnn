Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following order: 1, 2, 7, 4, 5, 6, 0, 3, 8, 9.

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

For each edge, we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This ensures that each triangle is only counted once.

Starting with the sorted edges:

(2, 3) - No triangles
(2, 3) - No triangles
(7, 9) - No triangles
(4, 6) - No triangles
(5, 0) - No triangles
(6, 5) - Triangle <0, 5, 6>
(0, 8) - Triangle <0, 8, 9>
(3, 8) - No triangles
(0, 9) - Triangle <0, 8, 9>
(4, 8) - Triangle <4, 8, 9>
(6, 7) - No triangles
(3, 9) - Triangle <3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 5, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <4, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 9>
