Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 2 -> 0 connections
Node 5 -> 0 connections
Node 0 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 2 connections
Node 5 -> 2 connections
Node 1 -> 3 connections
Node 7 -> 3 connections
Node 8 -> 4 connections
Node 3 -> 5 connections
Node 4 -> 6 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we now examine each edge starting from the vertex with the lower label if it has fewer connections. 

Examining the graph for triangles using the method described, we find the following triangles: 
[<1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 6>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [2].
