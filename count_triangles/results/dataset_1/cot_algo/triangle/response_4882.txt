Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:

Arranging the vertices based on their degree:  
Node 2: degree 1  
Node 6: degree 1  
Node 5: degree 1  
Node 3: degree 1  
Node 9: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 7: degree 5  

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 4):  
    Both 0 and 4 are connected to 7, forming triangle <0, 4, 7>.

2. For edge (0, 7):  
    Both 0 and 7 are connected to 4, forming triangle <0, 7, 4>.

3. For edge (0, 9):  
    Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes yet.

4. For edge (1, 4):  
    Both 1 and 4 are connected to 7, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.

5. For edge (1, 7):  
    Both 1 and 7 are connected to 4, forming triangle <1, 7, 4>.

6. For edge (1, 8):  
    Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes yet.

7. For edge (1, 9):  
    Node 9 is connected to 0, forming triangle <1, 9, 0>.

8. For edge (2, 8):  
    Node 8 is connected to 1, forming triangle <2, 8, 1>.

9. For edge (3, 7):  
    Both 3 and 7 are connected to 0, forming triangle <3, 7, 0>.

10. For edge (4, 0):  
    Both 0 and 4 are connected to 7, forming triangle <4, 0, 7>.

11. For edge (4, 1):  
    Both 1 and 4 are connected to 7, forming triangle <4, 1, 7>.

12. For edge (5, 7):  
    Node 7 is connected to 0 and 3, forming triangle <5, 7, 0> and <5, 7, 3>.

13. For edge (6, 8):  
    Node 8 is connected to 1, forming triangle <6, 8, 1>.

14. For edge (7, 0):  
    Both 0 and 7 are connected to 4, forming triangle <7, 0, 4>.

15. For edge (7, 1):  
    Both 1 and 7 are connected to 4, forming triangle <7, 1, 4>.

16. For edge (7, 3):  
    Node 3 is connected to 0, forming triangle <7, 3, 0>.

17. For edge (7, 5):  
    Node 7 is connected to 0, forming triangle <7, 5, 0>.

18. For edge (8, 1):  
    Both 1 and 8 are connected to 2, forming triangle <8, 1, 2>.

19. For edge (8, 2):  
    Node 8 is connected to 1, forming triangle <8, 2, 1>.

20. For edge (8, 6):  
    Node 8 is connected to 1, forming triangle <8, 6, 1>.

21. For edge (9, 0):  
    Node 9 is connected to 1, forming triangle <9, 0, 1>.

22. For edge (9, 1):  
    Node 9 is connected to 0, forming triangle <9, 1, 0>.
