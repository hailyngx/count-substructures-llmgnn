Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following labels:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with node 5 <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 3): No triangles formed.
3. Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
8. Edge (2, 1): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with node 9 <2, 5, 9>.
10. Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle with node 8 <2, 7, 8>.
11. Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (2, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5 <2, 5, 9>.
13. Edge (3, 0): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 4 <3, 4, 9>.
15. Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with node 7 <4, 6, 7>.
16. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (4, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 3 and 5 <4, 5, 9>.
18. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
19. Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
20. Edge (5, 9): Forms a triangle with node 2 <5, 9, 2>.
21. Edge (6, 0): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (6, 4): Forms a triangle with node 7 <6, 4, 7>.
23. Edge (7, 2): Already counted.
24. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.
25. Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
26. Edge (8, 2): Already counted.
27. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
28. Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
29. Edge (9, 2): Already counted.
30. Edge (9, 3): Already counted.
31. Edge (9, 4): Already counted.
32. Edge (9, 5): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
