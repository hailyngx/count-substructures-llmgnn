Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we get the following relabeling: 
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 2), (6, 8), (9, 8), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 0), (5, 8), (0, 9), (6, 0), (6, 8), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 0), (8, 9)
By checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<3, 5, 0>
<3, 6, 0>
<6, 8, 5>
<8, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
