Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Vertices: 6, 1, 4, 0, 8, 9, 2, 7, 3, 5

Now, we relabel the vertices accordingly:
Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will process the edges:
(0, 1): No triangles formed
(0, 4): No triangles formed
(1, 0): No triangles formed
(2, 5): No triangles formed
(2, 9): No triangles formed
(3, 5): No triangles formed
(3, 7): No triangles formed
(4, 0): No triangles formed
(5, 2): No triangles formed
(5, 3): No triangles formed
(5, 7): No triangles formed
(5, 8): No triangles formed
(5, 9): <5, 2, 9>
(6, 7): No triangles formed
(7, 3): No triangles formed
(7, 5): No triangles formed
(7, 6): No triangles formed
(7, 8): No triangles formed
(8, 5): No triangles formed
(8, 7): No triangles formed
(9, 2): <9, 2, 5>
(9, 5): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [2] 
Unique triangles: <5, 2, 9>, <9, 2, 5>
