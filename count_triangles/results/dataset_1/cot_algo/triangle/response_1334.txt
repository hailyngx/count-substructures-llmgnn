Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 

0 < 1 < 6 < 5 < 2 < 8 < 7 < 3 < 4 < 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Triangle <1, 5, 8>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
