Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 8: Degree 0
Vertex 6: Degree 2
Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 4: Degree 2
Vertex 3: Degree 3
Vertex 0: Degree 0
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 9: Degree 4

Now, we will proceed with the edges while ensuring that for each edge, the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we can find the triangles:

1. (1, 3) and (1, 5) share vertex 1, forming a triangle with vertex 3 and 5: <1, 3, 5>.
2. (1, 9) and (1, 5) share vertex 1, forming a triangle with vertex 5 and 9: <1, 5, 9>.
3. (2, 4) and (2, 6) share vertex 2, forming a triangle with vertex 4 and 6: <2, 4, 6>.
4. (2, 4) and (4, 7) share vertex 4, forming a triangle with vertex 2 and 7: <2, 4, 7>.
5. (3, 1) and (3, 5) share vertex 3, forming a triangle with vertex 1 and 5: <1, 3, 5>.
6. (3, 5) and (5, 1) share vertex 5, forming a triangle with vertex 1 and 3: <1, 3, 5>.
7. (4, 2) and (4, 7) share vertex 4, forming a triangle with vertex 2 and 7: <2, 4, 7>.
8. (6, 2) and (6, 9) share vertex 6, forming a triangle with vertex 2 and 9: <2, 6, 9>.
9. (9, 6) and (9, 8) share vertex 9, forming a triangle with vertex 6 and 8: <6, 8, 9>.
10. (9, 8) and (8, 9) share vertex 8, forming a triangle with vertex 9 and 8: <6, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10], and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, and <6, 8, 9>.
