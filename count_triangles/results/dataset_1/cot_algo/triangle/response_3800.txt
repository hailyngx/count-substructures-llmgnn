Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 5, 1, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3, 2

Now, we can count the number of triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method. The triangles are as follows:
<0, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
