Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with the following edges:
(1, 3) (1, 8) 
(2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) 
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) 
(4, 6) (4, 9) 
(5, 3) 
(6, 4) 
(7, 2) (7, 8) 
(8, 1) (8, 7) 
(9, 2) (9, 4)

First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
1: deg = 2
5: deg = 2
6: deg = 2
7: deg = 3
4: deg = 3
8: deg = 4
9: deg = 4
2: deg = 5
3: deg = 5

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
1 -> 1
5 -> 2
6 -> 3
7 -> 4
4 -> 5
8 -> 6
9 -> 7
2 -> 8
3 -> 9

Next, we will consider each edge to count the number of triangles:
For (1, 3) - Both have 2 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 2 -> Triangle: <1, 2, 3>
For (1, 8) - 1 has 2 connections, while 8 has 4 connections, so proceed: Shared connections with vertices 3 and 2 -> Triangles: <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>
For (2, 3) - Both have 5 connections, so do not proceed.
For (2, 7) - Both have 5 connections, so do not proceed.
For (2, 9) - 2 has 5 connections, while 9 has 4 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 4 -> Triangle: <2, 4, 9>
For (3, 1) - Both have 5 connections, so do not proceed.
For (3, 2) - Both have 5 connections, so do not proceed.
For (3, 5) - 3 has 5 connections, while 5 has 2 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 1 -> Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
For (4, 6) - Both have 2 connections, so do not proceed.
For (4, 9) - Both have 2 connections, so do not proceed.
For (5, 3) - Both have 2 connections, so do not proceed.
For (6, 4) - Both have 2 connections, so do not proceed.
For (7, 2) - Both have 3 connections, so do not proceed.
For (7, 8) - Both have 3 connections, so do not proceed.
For (8, 1) - 8 has 4 connections, while 1 has 2 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 3 -> Triangle: <1, 3, 8>
For (8, 7) - Both have 4 connections, so do not proceed.
For (9, 2) - 9 has 4 connections, while 2 has 5 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 4 -> Triangle: <2, 4, 9>
For (9, 4) - 9 has 4 connections, while 4 has 2 connections, so proceed: Shared connection with vertex 2 -> Triangle: <2, 4, 9>

After analyzing all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 9>.
