Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by degree, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. From edge (2, 1): Shared connection with 3 -> <1, 2, 3>
2. From edge (3, 1): Shared connection with 2 -> <1, 2, 3>
3. From edge (6, 0): Shared connection with 1 -> <0, 1, 6>
4. From edge (6, 4): Shared connection with 5 -> <4, 5, 6>
5. From edge (6, 5): Shared connection with 4 -> <4, 5, 6>
6. From edge (7, 0): Shared connection with 1 -> <0, 1, 7>
7. From edge (7, 3): Shared connection with 1 -> <1, 3, 7>
8. From edge (7, 4): Shared connection with 6 -> <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
