Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new order is: 9, 0, 5, 4, 2, 6, 1, 8, 3, 7.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 7>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
