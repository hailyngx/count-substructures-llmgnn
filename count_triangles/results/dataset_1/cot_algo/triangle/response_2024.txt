Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have:

0: 3 connections  
1: 3 connections  
3: 1 connection  
4: 2 connections  
7: 2 connections  
9: 2 connections  
5: 3 connections  
8: 3 connections  
2: 3 connections  
6: 4 connections 

We will now proceed to count the triangles based on this ordering:

1. Edge (3, 2) is skipped as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 3.
2. Edge (4, 5) is skipped as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 4.
3. Edge (8, 4) is skipped as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
4. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 1 with vertex 0.
5. Edge (7, 8) is skipped as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 7.
6. Edge (4, 8) is skipped as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.
7. Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 8 with vertex 4.
8. Edge (2, 3) is skipped as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 2.
9. Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 5 with vertex 5.

After considering all the edges, the total number of triangles found is [2].

The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7> and <4, 6, 8>.
