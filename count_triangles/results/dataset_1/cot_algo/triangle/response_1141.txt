Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph, the sorted vertices with their degrees are:
0: 3
1: 2
2: 2
3: 4
4: 4
5: 2
6: 6
7: 1
8: 4
9: 2

Now, we proceed to count the number of triangles:
- When considering edge (0, 1):
  - The shared connections are with vertex 2 and vertex 6, forming the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (0, 2):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 6, forming the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (0, 6):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (0) has more connections than vertex 6.
  
- When considering edge (1, 0):
  - The shared connections are with vertex 4 and vertex 6, forming the triangle <0, 1, 4>.
  
- When considering edge (1, 4):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (1) has fewer connections than vertex 4.
  
- When considering edge (2, 0):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 6, forming the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (2, 6):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (2) has fewer connections than vertex 6.
  
- When considering edge (3, 4):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 6, forming the triangle <3, 4, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (3, 5):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (3) has fewer connections than vertex 5.
  
- When considering edge (3, 6):
  - The shared connections are with vertex 4 and vertex 8, forming the triangle <3, 6, 8>.
  
- When considering edge (3, 8):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (3) has fewer connections than vertex 8.
  
- When considering edge (4, 1):
  - The shared connections are with vertex 3 and vertex 6, forming the triangle <1, 3, 4>.
  
- When considering edge (4, 3):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 6, forming the triangle <3, 4, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (4, 6):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 8, forming the triangle <4, 6, 8>.
  
- When considering edge (4, 9):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (4) has more connections than vertex 9.
  
- When considering edge (5, 3):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (3) has more connections than vertex 5.
  
- When considering edge (5, 8):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (5) has fewer connections than vertex 8.
  
- When considering edge (6, 0):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 2, forming the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (6, 2):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 0, forming the triangle <0, 2, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (6, 3):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 4, forming the triangle <3, 4, 6>.
  
- When considering edge (6, 4):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 8, forming the triangle <4, 6, 8>.
  
- When considering edge (6, 7):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (6) has more connections than vertex 7.
  
- When considering edge (6, 8):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 4, forming the triangle <4, 6, 8>.
  
- When considering edge (7, 6):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (7) has fewer connections than vertex 6.
  
- When considering edge (8, 3):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (3) has fewer connections than vertex 8.
  
- When considering edge (8, 5):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (5) has fewer connections than vertex 8.
  
- When considering edge (8, 6):
  - The shared connection is with vertex 4, forming the triangle <4, 6, 8>.
  
- When considering edge (8, 9):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (8) has more connections than vertex 9.
  
- When considering edge (9, 4):
  - No triangles are formed because the vertex with the lower label (9) has fewer connections than vertex 4.
  
The total number of triangles is [4].
