Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 1 connection.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 3 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 5 has 5 connections.
Vertex 6 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 8 has 3 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles in the graph:
1. (Vertex 0, Vertex 4) forms 0-4-1 triangle
2. (Vertex 1, Vertex 4) forms 1-4-2 triangle
3. (Vertex 1, Vertex 5) forms 1-5-3 triangle
4. (Vertex 2, Vertex 4) forms 2-4-0 triangle
5. (Vertex 2, Vertex 6) forms 2-6-3 triangle
6. (Vertex 3, Vertex 5) forms 3-5-1 triangle
7. (Vertex 3, Vertex 6) forms 3-6-2 triangle
8. (Vertex 3, Vertex 8) forms 3-8-6 triangle
9. (Vertex 4, Vertex 5) forms 4-5-1 triangle
10. (Vertex 5, Vertex 1) forms 5-1-4 triangle
11. (Vertex 5, Vertex 3) forms 5-3-6 triangle
12. (Vertex 5, Vertex 7) forms 5-7-9 triangle
13. (Vertex 5, Vertex 9) forms 5-9-7 triangle
14. (Vertex 6, Vertex 2) forms 6-2-4 triangle
15. (Vertex 6, Vertex 3) forms 6-3-5 triangle
16. (Vertex 6, Vertex 7) forms 6-7-5 triangle
17. (Vertex 6, Vertex 8) forms 6-8-3 triangle
18. (Vertex 7, Vertex 5) forms 7-5-3 triangle
19. (Vertex 7, Vertex 6) forms 7-6-3 triangle
20. (Vertex 7, Vertex 9) forms 7-9-5 triangle
21. (Vertex 8, Vertex 3) forms 8-3-5 triangle
22. (Vertex 8, Vertex 6) forms 8-6-3 triangle
23. (Vertex 8, Vertex 9) forms 8-9-5 triangle
24. (Vertex 9, Vertex 5) forms 9-5-1 triangle
25. (Vertex 9, Vertex 7) forms 9-7-5 triangle
26. (Vertex 9, Vertex 8) forms 9-8-6 triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [26]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 4, 1>, 
<1, 4, 2>, 
<1, 5, 3>, 
<2, 4, 0>, 
<2, 6, 3>, 
<3, 5, 1>, 
<3, 6, 2>, 
<3, 8, 6>, 
<4, 5, 1>, 
<5, 1, 4>, 
<5, 3, 6>, 
<5, 7, 9>, 
<5, 9, 7>, 
<6, 2, 4>, 
<6, 3, 5>, 
<6, 7, 5>, 
<6, 8, 3>, 
<7, 5, 3>, 
<7, 6, 3>, 
<7, 9, 5>, 
<8, 3, 5>, 
<8, 6, 3>,
