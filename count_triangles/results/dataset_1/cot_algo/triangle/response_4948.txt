Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we have the following labels for each vertex:
- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 5 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections
- Node 0: 7 connections

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

We start with the edge (0, 2) since node 0 has fewer connections than node 2 and check for shared connections:
Triangle <0, 2, 3>

Next, we move to the edge (0, 3) since node 0 has fewer connections than node 3 and check for shared connections:
Triangle <0, 3, 1>

Proceeding to the edge (0, 7), we find no triangles with this edge.
Moving to the edge (0, 8), we find no triangles with this edge.
Moving to the edge (0, 9), we find no triangles with this edge.

Moving to the edge (1, 3) since node 1 has fewer connections than node 3 and check for shared connections:
Triangle <1, 3, 0>

Proceeding with the rest of the edges in the same manner and avoiding duplicate triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 1>, <1, 3, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
