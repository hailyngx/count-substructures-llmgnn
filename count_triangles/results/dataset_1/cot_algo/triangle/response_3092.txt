Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 6

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start from edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 have 1 common neighbor, Node 4. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
2. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 have 0 common neighbors.
3. Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 have 1 common neighbor, Node 1. Triangle formed: <0, 1, 4>
4. Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 have 1 common neighbor, Node 4. Triangle formed: <3, 4, 7>
5. Edge (8, 7): Nodes 8 and 7 have 1 common neighbor, Node 4. Triangle formed: <4, 7, 8>
6. Edge (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 have 1 common neighbor, Node 4. Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>
7. Edge (2, 9): Nodes 2 and 9 have 1 common neighbor, Node 4. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 7>.
