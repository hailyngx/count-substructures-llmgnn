Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
1. Node 1 - 2 connections
2. Node 9 - 2 connections
3. Node 3 - 2 connections
4. Node 0 - 2 connections
5. Node 5 - 4 connections
6. Node 6 - 4 connections
7. Node 4 - 5 connections
8. Node 2 - 5 connections
9. Node 8 - 6 connections
10. Node 7 - 7 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

[Total number of triangles: 7]

<0, 6, 7>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<4, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 4>
