Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on the number of connections are: 

Vertex 5: Degree = 1  
Vertex 0: Degree = 2  
Vertex 9: Degree = 2  
Vertex 7: Degree = 3  
Vertex 5: Degree = 3  
Vertex 1: Degree = 4  
Vertex 2: Degree = 4  
Vertex 8: Degree = 4  
Vertex 3: Degree = 5  
Vertex 4: Degree = 5  

The unique triangles formed are:  
<1, 4, 7>  
   

The total number of triangles is [1].
