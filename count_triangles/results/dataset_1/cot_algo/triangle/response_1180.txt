Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex are:
Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 7 has 0 connections (not included in the given graph).
Vertex 1 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 6 connections.

We will now count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 9>
2. <0, 2, 5>
3. <0, 8, 5>
4. <1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 9, 5>
6. <2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
