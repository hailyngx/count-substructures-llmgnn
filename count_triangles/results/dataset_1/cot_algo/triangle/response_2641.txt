Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of vertices is as follows:
Nodes: 1, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <2, 7, 8>
