Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:
Vertex 3 (Degree: 2)  
Vertex 7 (Degree: 1)  
Vertex 9 (Degree: 2)  
Vertex 0 (Degree: 4)  
Vertex 6 (Degree: 3)  
Vertex 2 (Degree: 4)  
Vertex 5 (Degree: 4)  
Vertex 1 (Degree: 6)  
Vertex 8 (Degree: 4)  
Vertex 4 (Degree: 5)  

After relabelling the vertices, the graph becomes:
Edges: (3, 7) (7, 9) (3, 9) (7, 6) (3, 6) (7, 2) (3, 2) (6, 9) (2, 9) (5, 9) (0, 7) (6, 0) (2, 7) (5, 3) (0, 5) (6, 5) (2, 3) (1, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (5, 7) (1, 3) (0, 2) (5, 6) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 4) (9, 4) (8, 4) (9, 8) (1, 4) (0, 1) (8, 0) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (8, 5)  

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we get:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 7> <2, 3, 5> <0, 2, 7> <4, 6, 9>
