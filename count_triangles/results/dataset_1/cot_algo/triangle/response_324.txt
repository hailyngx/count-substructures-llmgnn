Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new ordering is: 8, 1, 7, 5, 4, 9, 3, 6, 2, 0.

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>
- Triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
