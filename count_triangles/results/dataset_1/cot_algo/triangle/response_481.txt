Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. Then, we need to relabel the vertices accordingly.

After sorting the vertices, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 - 1 connection
1 - 1 connection
3 - 1 connection
6 - 1 connection
9 - 1 connection
7 - 2 connections
4 - 3 connections
5 - 4 connections
8 - 5 connections
2 - 0 connections (not present in the given edges)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles based on the described method:

1. (0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have 1 connection each. No triangle formed.
2. (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have 1 connection each. No triangle formed.
3. (1, 5): Both 1 and 5 have 1 connection each. No triangle formed.
4. (3, 8): Both 3 and 8 have 1 connection each. No triangle formed.
5. (4, 8): 4 has 3 connections, and 8 has 5 connections. Forming a triangle with the shared connection with 3.
6. (5, 7): 5 has 4 connections, and 7 has 2 connections. Forming a triangle with the shared connection with 9.
7. (5, 8): 5 has 4 connections, and 8 has 5 connections. Forming a triangle with the shared connection with 7.
8. (7, 9): 7 has 2 connections, and 9 has 1 connection. No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found: <4, 5, 8>, <5, 7, 9>
