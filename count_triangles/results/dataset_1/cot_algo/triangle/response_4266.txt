Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node degrees:
Node 1: 1
Node 3: 2
Node 8: 1
Node 7: 3
Node 5: 5
Node 4: 4
Node 9: 4
Node 0: 5
Node 6: 6
Node 2: 6

After sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes will be:
Node 1: 0
Node 8: 1
Node 3: 2
Node 7: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 4: 5
Node 9: 6
Node 0: 7
Node 6: 8
Node 2: 9

Now, let's count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [13]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
