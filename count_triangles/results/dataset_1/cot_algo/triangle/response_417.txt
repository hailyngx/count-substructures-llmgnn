Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 6 and 4 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 3 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 5 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 2, 8, and 9 have 4 connections each.

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 4 -> A
Node 6 -> B
Node 3 -> C
Node 7 -> D
Node 1 -> E
Node 5 -> F
Node 2 -> G
Node 8 -> H
Node 9 -> I

Now, we check the edges based on the new labeling:

(E, G)
(E, D)
(E, H)
(G, E)
(G, C)
(G, B)
(G, D)
(G, H)
(C, G)
(C, F)
(F, C)
(F, I)
(B, G)
(D, E)
(D, G)
(H, E)
(H, G)
(H, I)
(I, F)
(I, H)

Counting the triangles formed by the edges:

- Triangle <E, G, D>
- Triangle <G, C, F>
- Triangle <G, H, I>

Total number of triangles: [3]
