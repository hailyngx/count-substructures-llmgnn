Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph sorted by degree-based ordering is as follows:
Node 4 - 1 connection
Node 3 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 0 - 4 connections
Node 7 - 4 connections
Node 2 - 4 connections
Node 1 - 5 connections
Node 9 - 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 9, 4>
