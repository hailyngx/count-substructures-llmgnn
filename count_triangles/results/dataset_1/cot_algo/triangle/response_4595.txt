Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections, we have the following list: <br>
Nodes: 2, 0, 8, 5, 6, 3, 7, 1, 9, 4 <br>
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 9), (7, 4), (8, 9) 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

1. For edge (0, 1):
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 7
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7
    - Shared connections between 0 and 1: Node 7
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 7>

2. For edge (0, 7):
    - Node 0 has connections with nodes 1 and 7
    - Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 4
    - Shared connections between 0 and 7: Node 1
    - Triangle formed: <0, 7, 1>

3. For edge (1, 4):
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7
    - Node 4 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9
    - Shared connections between 1 and 4: Node 7
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 7>

Total number of triangles: [3]
