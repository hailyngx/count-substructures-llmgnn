Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most connections: 
Vertices: [4, 7, 5, 6, 1, 8, 0, 2, 3, 9]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check each edge to find triangles:
1. Edge (0, 6) - Check shared connections: (0, 9), (6, 9)
2. Edge (0, 9) - Check shared connections: (6, 9)
3. Edge (1, 8) - No triangles
4. Edge (2, 3) - Check shared connections: (2, 9), (3, 9)
5. Edge (2, 9) - Check shared connections: (0, 6), (3, 9), (5, 9)
6. Edge (3, 2) - Check shared connections: (2, 9), (3, 9)
7. Edge (3, 8) - No triangles
8. Edge (3, 9) - Check shared connections: (2, 9), (5, 9)
9. Edge (5, 9) - No triangles
10. Edge (6, 0) - Check shared connections: (0, 9)
11. Edge (8, 1) - No triangles
12. Edge (8, 3) - No triangles
13. Edge (9, 0) - Check shared connections: (0, 6), (0, 9)
14. Edge (9, 2) - Check shared connections: (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 9)
15. Edge (9, 3) - Check shared connections: (2, 9), (5, 9)
16. Edge (9, 5) - No triangles

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 9>
