Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new vertex labels are: 
Vertices: 9, 1, 5, 6, 8, 4, 0, 2, 7, 3

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 9>

There are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
