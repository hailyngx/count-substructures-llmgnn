Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The degrees of the vertices in this graph are as follows:
Vertex 0: 3
Vertex 1: 3
Vertex 2: 3
Vertex 3: 4
Vertex 4: 3
Vertex 5: 4
Vertex 6: 3
Vertex 7: 3
Vertex 8: 5
Vertex 9: 5

The sorted vertices are:
0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 5, 8, 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Looking at the edges, for each edge, we will only consider cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 8, 3>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 9, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [11]
