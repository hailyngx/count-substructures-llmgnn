Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 5: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 0: 3 connections  
Node 7: 3 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 6: 5 connections  

Next, we relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 0  
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 1  
Node 5 (2 connections) -> Node 2  
Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node 3  
Node 0 (3 connections) -> Node 4  
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 5  
Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node 6  
Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node 7  
Node 8 (4 connections) -> Node 8  
Node 6 (5 connections) -> Node 9  

Now, we focus on each edge starting from the lowest labeled vertex with fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 have no shared connections.
2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
3. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 have no shared connections.
4. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 have no shared connections.
5. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 have no shared connections.
6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 have no shared connections.
7. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 have no shared connections.
8. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 and Node 8 have no shared connections.
9. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 have no shared connections.
10. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 have no shared connections.
11. Edge (4, 7): Node 4 and Node 7 have no shared connections.
12. Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 have no shared connections.
13. Edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 have no shared connections.
14. Edge (7, 9): Node 7 and Node 9 have no shared connections.

Hence, there are no triangles in this graph. So, the total number of triangles is [0].
