Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels are as follows:  
Node 7 has 0 connections.  
Node 1 has 1 connection.  
Node 2 has 1 connection.  
Node 5 has 1 connection.  
Node 8 has 2 connections.  
Node 4 has 3 connections.  
Node 0 has 4 connections.  
Node 3 has 4 connections.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 9 has 4 connections.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found are:  
<0, 3, 9>  
<0, 3, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
