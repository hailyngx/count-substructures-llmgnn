Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows: 

0 (degree 1)  
4 (degree 1)  
7 (degree 1)  
8 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 5)  
2 (degree 6)  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>
- Triangle <0, 2, 1>
- Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 3>
- Triangle <1, 9, 4>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <2, 6, 3>
- Triangle <2, 7, 6>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>
- Triangle <2, 1, 9>
- Triangle <2, 1, 6>
- Triangle <3, 6, 9>
- Triangle <3, 6, 5>
- Triangle <4, 9, 6>
- Triangle <5, 3, 6>
- Triangle <5, 3, 8>
- Triangle <6, 8, 5>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [22]
