Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows: 

Node 5 - Degree: 1
Node 3 - Degree: 1
Node 7 - Degree: 1
Node 4 - Degree: 2
Node 2 - Degree: 2
Node 7 - Degree: 2
Node 3 - Degree: 3
Node 5 - Degree: 3
Node 6 - Degree: 4
Node 9 - Degree: 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
