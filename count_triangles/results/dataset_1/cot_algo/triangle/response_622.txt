Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling for the vertices is as follows: 

Vertices: 
0 - 2 connections
1 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
8 - 2 connections
9 - 3 connections
6 - 4 connections
3 - 4 connections
7 - 5 connections
2 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge considering only the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing the edges, we find the following triangles: 
- (0, 2) and (2, 0) share node 3: <0, 2, 3>
- (0, 3) and (3, 0) share node 2: <0, 2, 3>
- (2, 3) and (3, 2) share nodes 0 and 7: <0, 2, 3>
- (2, 6) and (6, 2) share nodes 4 and 7: <2, 4, 6>
- (3, 7) and (7, 3) share nodes 0, 2, and 9: <0, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 7>
- (4, 6) and (6, 4) share node 7: <4, 6, 7>
- (6, 7) and (7, 6) share nodes 2, 3, 9: <2, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>
- (7, 9) and (9, 7) share nodes 2 and 3: <2, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] in this graph.
