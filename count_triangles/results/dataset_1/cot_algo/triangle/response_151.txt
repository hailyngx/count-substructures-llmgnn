Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will now count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertices: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 0, 3, 6, 8, 9

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will proceed with the edges as follows:

1. Edge (0, 5): Both vertices share connections with vertex 3, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
2. Edge (1, 8): No triangle is formed.
3. Edge (2, 8): No triangle is formed.
4. Edge (3, 5): No triangle is formed.
5. Edge (3, 9): No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (5, 0): No triangle is formed.
7. Edge (5, 3): Both vertices share connections with vertex 9, forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
8. Edge (5, 9): No triangle is formed.
9. Edge (6, 9): No triangle is formed.
10. Edge (7, 8): No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (8, 1): No triangle is formed.
12. Edge (8, 2): No triangle is formed.
13. Edge (8, 7): No triangle is formed.
14. Edge (8, 9): No triangle is formed.
15. Edge (9, 3): No triangle is formed.
16. Edge (9, 5): No triangle is formed.
17. Edge (9, 6): No triangle is formed.
18. Edge (9, 8): No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <3, 5, 9>.
