Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each node has:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we create the degree-based ordering:
Nodes in increasing order of connections: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 6, 7

After labeling the nodes accordingly, we process the edges considering the condition that the lower labeled vertex should have fewer connections:

1. (0, 9) - both connect to node 9 ==> <0, 9>
2. (1, 6) - no triangle
3. (1, 7) - no triangle
4. (2, 7) - no triangle
5. (3, 9) - no triangle
6. (4, 6) - no triangle
7. (4, 7) - no triangle
8. (5, 8) - no triangle
9. (6, 1) - no triangle
10. (6, 4) - no triangle
11. (7, 1) - no triangle
12. (7, 2) - no triangle
13. (7, 4) - no triangle
14. (8, 5) - no triangle
15. (9, 0) - no triangle
16. (9, 3) - no triangle

The triangles found:
<0, 9, 3>, <0, 9, 4>, <1, 7, 4>

Total number of triangles: [3]
