Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeling: 

Vertex 2 <--> Node 0 (Degree: 2)

Vertex 6 <--> Node 1 (Degree: 0)

Vertex 9 <--> Node 2 (Degree: 1)

Vertex 5 <--> Node 3 (Degree: 2)

Vertex 4 <--> Node 4 (Degree: 3)

Vertex 8 <--> Node 5 (Degree: 4)

Vertex 7 <--> Node 6 (Degree: 4)

Vertex 1 <--> Node 7 (Degree: 4)

Vertex 3 <--> Node 8 (Degree: 4)

Vertex 0 <--> Node 9 (Degree: 2)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles. 

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 6, 7>
