Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.
Node 1 has 7 connections.
Node 3 has 7 connections.

Next, we will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 < Node 7, so we check for shared connections. Both nodes have a connection to Node 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (1, 2): Node 2 < Node 1, but Node 2 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
3. Edge (1, 3): Node 3 < Node 1, but Node 3 has more connections, so we skip this edge.
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 4 < Node 1, but Node 4 has equal connections, so we proceed. Nodes 1, 4, 6 form a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
5. Edge (1, 5): Node 5 < Node 1, but Node 5 has equal connections, so we proceed. Nodes 1, 5, 6 form a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Node 1 < Node 6, so we check for shared connections. Both nodes have a connection to Node 4, forming a triangle <1, 4, 6>.
7. Edge (2, 1): Node 1 < Node 2, so we check for shared connections. Both nodes have a connection to Node 4, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
8. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 < Node 4, so we check for shared connections. Node 2 has connections to Nodes 1 and 4, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (2, 8): Node 8 < Node 2, so we check for shared connections. Both nodes have a connection to Node 5, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.
...

After analyzing all eligible edges, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, and <1, 2, 4>.
