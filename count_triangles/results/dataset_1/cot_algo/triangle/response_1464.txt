Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most are: 

Vertex 5: Connected to 1  
Vertex 8: Connected to 1, 0  
Vertex 9: Connected to 1, 7  
Vertex 3: Connected to 2, 4, 6  
Vertex 1: Connected to 2, 5, 6  
Vertex 0: Connected to 4, 6, 7, 8  
Vertex 2: Connected to 4, 6  
Vertex 7: Connected to 4, 6, 0, 9  
Vertex 4: Connected to 3, 2, 6, 7  
Vertex 6: Connected to 4, 3, 1, 2, 0, 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate over the edges and count the triangles. 

The triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
