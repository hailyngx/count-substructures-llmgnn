Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph sorted by degree-based ordering is: 

Nodes: 7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 1, 4, 3, 9, 2

Using this ordering, we can count the following triangles:

1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <1, 2, 4>
3. <1, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
