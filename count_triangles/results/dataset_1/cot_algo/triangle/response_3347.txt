Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 0: degree 2  
Node 4: degree 2  
Node 8: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 3  
Node 6: degree 3  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 5  
Node 2: degree 6  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 1): No triangles are formed.
2. For edge (0, 7): No triangles are formed.
3. For edge (1, 2): No triangles are formed.
4. For edge (1, 8): No triangles are formed.
5. For edge (2, 5): No triangles are formed.
6. For edge (2, 6): No triangles are formed.
7. For edge (2, 7): Triangle <2, 7, 9> is formed.
8. For edge (3, 4): No triangles are formed.
9. For edge (3, 7): No triangles are formed.
10. For edge (3, 9): No triangles are formed.
11. For edge (5, 6): No triangles are formed.
12. For edge (7, 0): No triangles are formed.
13. For edge (7, 2): Triangle <2, 7, 9> is formed.
14. For edge (7, 3): No triangles are formed.
15. For edge (7, 9): Triangle <3, 7, 9> is formed.

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is given inside brackets:
