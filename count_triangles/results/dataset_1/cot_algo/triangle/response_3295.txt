Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's rearrange the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices by number of connections:
0 - 1 connection
1 - 2 connections
2 - 2 connections
3 - 1 connection
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
6 - 3 connections
7 - 4 connections
8 - 4 connections
9 - 3 connections

Reorder the vertices:
0 -> 1
1 -> 3
2 -> 3
3 -> 1
4 -> 3
5 -> 3
6 -> 4
7 -> 5
8 -> 5
9 -> 4

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 8>, <3, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>]

Total number of triangles: [8]
