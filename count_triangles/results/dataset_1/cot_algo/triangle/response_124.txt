Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new node labels are:  

Node 0 is connected to [4, 6, 9]  
Node 1 is connected to [2, 9]  
Node 3 is connected to [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]  
Node 7 is connected to [2, 3, 6, 8]  
Node 9 is connected to [0, 1, 2, 5, 8]  
Node 2 is connected to [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]  
Node 5 is connected to [2, 3, 6, 8, 9]  
Node 8 is connected to [3, 5, 6, 7, 9]  
Node 4 is connected to [0, 2, 3, 6]  
Node 6 is connected to [0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]  

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:  
Total number of triangles: [9]  
Unique triangles:  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<2, 5, 9>  
<3, 5, 8>  
<5, 6, 8>  
<5, 6, 9>  
<5, 8, 9>  
<6, 7, 8>  
<6, 8, 9>
