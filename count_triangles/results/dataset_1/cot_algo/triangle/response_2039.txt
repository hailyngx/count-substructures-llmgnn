Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 3, 8, 6, 2, 7.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 7): No triangles can be formed.
2. Edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
5. Edge (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 3>
6. Edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
7. Edge (2, 7): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
8. Edge (3, 2): Triangle formed: <3, 5, 2>
9. Edge (3, 5): No triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (4, 1): No triangles can be formed.
11. Edge (4, 9): No triangles can be formed.
12. Edge (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.
13. Edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
14. Edge (6, 2): No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (6, 8): No triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed.
17. Edge (7, 0): No triangles can be formed.
18. Edge (7, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 6, 7>
19. Edge (7, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 7>
20. Edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
21. Edge (9, 4): No triangles can be formed.
22. Edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 2>
