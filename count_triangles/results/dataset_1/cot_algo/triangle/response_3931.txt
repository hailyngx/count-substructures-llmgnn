Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:  

Vertices:  
7 -> 1 connection  
2 -> 2 connections  
3 -> 2 connections  
9 -> 2 connections  
0 -> 3 connections  
5 -> 3 connections  
1 -> 3 connections  
8 -> 3 connections  
4 -> 4 connections  
6 -> 6 connections  

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their connections:  

Vertices:  
7 -> 1  
2 -> 2  
3 -> 3  
9 -> 4  
0 -> 5  
5 -> 6  
1 -> 7  
8 -> 8  
4 -> 9  
6 -> 10  

Now, we will check each edge based on the labels and count the triangles:

Triangles:  
<0, 1, 6>  
<0, 1, 5>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 3, 5>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<0, 6, 9>  
<1, 2, 6>  
<1, 5, 6>  
<3, 5, 6>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<5, 6, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [11]
