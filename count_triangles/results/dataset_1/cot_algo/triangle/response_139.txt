Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

    Vertex 1: 1 connection
    Vertex 5: 1 connection
    Vertex 6: 1 connection
    Vertex 3: 2 connections
    Vertex 4: 2 connections
    Vertex 7: Not present in the graph
    Vertex 0: 3 connections
    Vertex 2: 3 connections
    Vertex 9: 4 connections
    Vertex 8: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the number of connections:

    Vertex 1 (1 connection) -> Vertex 1
    Vertex 5 (1 connection) -> Vertex 2
    Vertex 6 (1 connection) -> Vertex 3
    Vertex 3 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
    Vertex 4 (2 connections) -> Vertex 5
    Vertex 0 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
    Vertex 2 (3 connections) -> Vertex 7
    Vertex 9 (4 connections) -> Vertex 8
    Vertex 8 (5 connections) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will count the triangles using the degree-based ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 4):
   Both vertices have 2 shared connections: 8 and 9
   Triangle: <0, 4, 8>

2. Edge (0, 9):
   Both vertices have 1 shared connection: 8
   Triangle: <0, 9, 8>

3. Edge (1, 2):
   Both vertices have no shared connections, so no triangle.

4. Edge (2, 1):
   Both vertices have no shared connections, so no triangle.

5. Edge (2, 9):
   Both vertices have 1 shared connection: 8
   Triangle: <2, 9, 8>

6. Edge (3, 8):
   Both vertices have no shared connections, so no triangle.

7. Edge (4, 0):
   Already counted in edge (0, 4).

8. Edge (5, 8):
   Both vertices have no shared connections, so no triangle.

9. Edge (6, 8):
   Both vertices have no shared connections, so no triangle.

10. Edge (8, 3):
    Already counted in edge (3, 8).

11. Edge (8, 5):
    Already counted in edge (5, 8).

12. Edge (8, 6):
    Already counted in edge (6, 8).

13. Edge (8, 9):
    Both vertices have 3 shared connections: 0, 2, and 9
    Triangle: <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 2>

14. Edge (9, 0):
    Already counted in edge (0, 9).

15. Edge (9, 2):
    Already counted in edge (2, 9).

16. Edge (9, 8):
    Already counted in edge (8, 9).

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 4, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 8>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 2>.
