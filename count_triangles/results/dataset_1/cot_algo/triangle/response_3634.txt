Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is used to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections (degree):
0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 4)
5 (degree 6)
3 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
4 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
2 (degree 1)
6 (degree 2)

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 8, 4>

Total number of triangles: [8]
