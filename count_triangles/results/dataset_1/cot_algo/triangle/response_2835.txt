Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree:

0: degree 1
1: degree 1
4: degree 0
6: degree 1
9: degree 1
2: degree 4
5: degree 2
3: degree 3
7: degree 5
8: degree 2

Next, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
4 -> 2
6 -> 3
9 -> 4
2 -> 5
5 -> 6
3 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9

Now, looking at the edges, we see that we can count the following triangles:
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
