Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by number of connections:
0: 5
1: 5
4: 5
9: 5
7: 4
8: 3
2: 2
3: 3
6: 2
5: 1

With the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:

1. Edge between 0 and 1: (0, 1) - Shared connections: 4, 7, 8
2. Edge between 0 and 2: (0, 2) - No triangles
3. Edge between 0 and 4: (0, 4) - Shared connections: 7
4. Edge between 0 and 7: (0, 7) - No triangles
5. Edge between 0 and 8: (0, 8) - No triangles
6. Edge between 1 and 3: (1, 3) - Shared connections: 9
7. Edge between 1 and 4: (1, 4) - Shared connections: 7, 9
8. Edge between 1 and 7: (1, 7) - Shared connections: 4, 9
9. Edge between 1 and 9: (1, 9) - Shared connections: 4, 7
10. Edge between 3 and 8: (3, 8) - No triangles
11. Edge between 3 and 9: (3, 9) - No triangles
12. Edge between 4 and 7: (4, 7) - No triangles
13. Edge between 4 and 9: (4, 9) - Shared connections: 7
14. Edge between 7 and 5: (7, 5) - No triangles
15. Edge between 9 and 6: (9, 6) - No triangles
16. Edge between 9 and 8: (9, 8) - Shared connections: 3

Total number of triangles = [3]
Unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
