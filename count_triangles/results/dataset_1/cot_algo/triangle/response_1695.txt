Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections

Rearranging the nodes based on their degree:
8, 7, 4, 5, 3, 9, 1, 6, 2, 0

Counting the triangles by examining each edge in order:

1. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (9, 1): Triangle formed: <1, 9, 0>.
7. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 9, 0>, <0, 2, 6>.
