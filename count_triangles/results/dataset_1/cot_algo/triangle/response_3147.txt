Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 9, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 5, 2, 4, 6

Now we relabel the vertices:

0 -> 0 (degree 4)
1 -> 1 (degree 2)
2 -> 2 (degree 2)
3 -> 3 (degree 1)
4 -> 4 (degree 5)
5 -> 5 (degree 4)
6 -> 6 (degree 5)
8 -> 7 (degree 3)
9 -> 8 (degree 2)

Now, we will go through the edges based on the lower label vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 5): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle
- Edge (2, 4): No triangle
- Edge (2, 6): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (3, 6): No triangle
- Edge (4, 1): No triangle
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (4, 6): Shared connection with 0 and 2 -> Triangles <0, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (4, 8): No triangle
- Edge (5, 0): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 4): Shared connection with 0 -> Triangle <0, 4, 5>
- Edge (5, 8): No triangle
- Edge (6, 0): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle
- Edge (6, 2): Shared connection with 4 -> Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (6, 3): No triangle
- Edge (6, 4): Shared connection with 0 and 2 -> Triangles <0, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 6>
- Edge (8, 4): No triangle
- Edge (8, 5): No triangle
- Edge (8, 9): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>
