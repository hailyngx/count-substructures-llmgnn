Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the order becomes: 3 < 7 < 1 < 7 < 5 < 7 < 6 < 6 < 4 < 4

Now, we will count the triangles as per the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Looking at the edge (0, 1): Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 1 has 3 connections. As Node 1 has fewer connections, we proceed to check shared connections. Node 0 and Node 1 share 2 connections (Node 2 and Node 9), forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share 2 connections (Node 1 and Node 9), forming a triangle <0, 2, 1>.

- Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 3 connections. Proceed to check shared connections - Node 0 and Node 5 share 1 connection, forming a triangle <0, 5, 7>.

- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 and Node 9 share 2 connections (Node 1 and Node 2), forming a triangle <0, 9, 1>.

- Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 share 2 connections (Node 0 and Node 9), forming a triangle <1, 2, 0>.

- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 and Node 9 share 2 connections (Node 0 and Node 2), forming a triangle <1, 9, 0>.

- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 and Node 4 share 1 connection, forming a triangle <2, 4, 3>.

- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 share 1 connection, forming a triangle <5, 6, 4>.

- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 share 1 connection, forming a triangle <6, 8, 4>.

So, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
