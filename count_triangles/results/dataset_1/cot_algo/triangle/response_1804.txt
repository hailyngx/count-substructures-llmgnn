Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling should be:
Node 6 is connected to 1 other node.
Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 2 other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to 6 other nodes.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections than the other vertex:

Possible triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<9, 6, 1>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [6].
