Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new vertex labels are as follows: 

Node 3 has 1 connection.
Nodes 0, 8, and 6 have 2 connections.
Nodes 1, 7, and 9 have 3 connections.
Nodes 2 and 5 have 4 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, the triangles in the graph are as follows: 

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
