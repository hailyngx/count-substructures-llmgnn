Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by degree: 
Node 5 (degree 1), Node 2 (degree 1), Node 8 (degree 2), Node 5 (degree 2), Node 2 (degree 2), Node 4 (degree 4), Node 6 (degree 4), Node 1 (degree 5), Node 0 (degree 5), Node 9 (degree 6), Node 3 (degree 6), Node 7 (degree 6)
