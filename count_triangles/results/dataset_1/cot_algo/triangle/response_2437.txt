Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels for each node:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Nodes 4 and 9: 2 connections
Nodes 3, 7, and 8: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Now, following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <0, 2, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
