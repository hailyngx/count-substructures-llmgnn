Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Starting with the edge (0, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (0, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (0, 6): We can form a triangle <0, 6, 1>.
- Moving to the edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (1, 6): We can form a triangle <1, 6, 0>.
- Moving to the edge (1, 8): We can form a triangle <1, 8, 6>.
- Moving to the edge (2, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (3, 6): We can form a triangle <3, 6, 1>.
- Moving to the edge (3, 8): We can form a triangle <3, 8, 6>.
- Moving to the edge (4, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (4, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (5, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (6, 0): We can form a triangle <6, 0, 3>.
- Moving to the edge (6, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (6, 3): We can form a triangle <6, 3, 0>.
- Moving to the edge (6, 8): We can form a triangle <6, 8, 1> and <6, 8, 3>.
- Moving to the edge (7, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (7, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 1): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (9, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Moving to the edge (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is: [6]
The unique triangles found are: <0, 6, 1>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 8, 6>, <3, 6, 1>, <3, 8, 6>, <6, 0, 3>.
