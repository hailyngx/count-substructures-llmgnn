Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Then we relabel the vertices according to their new order.

Sorted vertices by degree:
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 8: 7 connections

Edges to be considered based on the method:
(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 7) (8, 9)

Calculating the triangles:
1. <2, 4, 7>
2. <2, 3, 4>
3. <2, 3, 5>
4. <2, 5, 6>
5. <3, 4, 7>
6. <0, 1, 8>
7. <0, 5, 6>
8. <0, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
