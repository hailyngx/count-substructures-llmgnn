Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:
1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
   - Node 5 has 1 connection.
   - Nodes 8 and 9 each have 2 connections.
   - Nodes 3 and 7 each have 3 connections.
   - Nodes 1 and 4 each have 5 connections.
   - Nodes 2 and 6 each have 6 connections.
   - Node 0 has 7 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
   - Node 5 (Degree 1) -> Label 0
   - Nodes 8 and 9 (Degree 2) -> Label 1 and 2
   - Nodes 3 and 7 (Degree 3) -> Label 3 and 4
   - Nodes 1 and 4 (Degree 5) -> Label 5 and 6
   - Nodes 2 and 6 (Degree 6) -> Label 7 and 8
   - Node 0 (Degree 7) -> Label 9

3. Process each edge with the vertex of lower label having fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Vertex 3 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 0 and Node 3 -> Shared connections: 6 => Triangle <0, 3, 6>
- Edge (0, 5): Vertex 5 has fewer connections. No triangle.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 6 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 0 and Node 6 -> Shared connections: 1, 2, 3, 4 => Triangles <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 9 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 0 and Node 9 -> Shared connections: 2 => Triangle <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. No triangle.
- Edge (1, 4): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 1 and Node 4 -> Shared connections: 6 => Triangle <1, 4, 6>
- Edge (1, 6): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 1 and Node 6 -> Shared connections: 0, 2, 3, 4 => Triangles <1, 0, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>
- Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 1 and Node 7 -> Shared connections: 2 => Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 2 and Node 7 -> Shared connections: 1 => Triangle <2, 1, 7>
- Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 3 and Node 6 -> Shared connections: 0 => Triangle <3, 0, 6>
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has fewer connections. No triangle.
- Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 has fewer connections. No triangle.
- Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has fewer connections. Check shared connections of Node 6 and Node 7 -> Shared connections: 1, 2 => Triangles <6, 1, 7>, <6, 2, 7>

The total number of triangles: [12]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 0, 6>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 0, 6>, <6, 1, 7>
