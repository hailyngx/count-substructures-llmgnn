Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:  

Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 6: 5 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 9: 1 connection  

Next, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:  

Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 0  
Node 1 (3 connections) -> Node 2  
Node 2 (3 connections) -> Node 3  
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 1  
Node 4 (1 connection) -> Node 6  
Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node 7  
Node 6 (5 connections) -> Node 4  
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 5  
Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node 8  
Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 9  

Now, let's list the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

Triangles:  
<0, 2, 3>  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 3, 6>  
<1, 3, 7>  
<2, 4, 6>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<6, 7, 9>  
<6, 7, 9>  

Count of triangles: [9]
