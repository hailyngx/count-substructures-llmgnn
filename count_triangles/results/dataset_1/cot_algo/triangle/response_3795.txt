Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Node 2 < Node 5 < Node 9 < Node 3 < Node 1 < Node 6 < Node 4 < Node 8 < Node 0 < Node 7

Now, we will start counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (2, 3): No triangles can be formed.
2. Edge (5, 4): No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (9, 1): No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (3, 2): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
6. Edge (6, 8): No triangles can be formed.
7. Edge (4, 6): Triangle formed: <6, 4, 0>
8. Edge (8, 6): No triangles can be formed.
9. Edge (0, 4): Triangle formed: <4, 0, 6>
10. Edge (7, 0): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <6, 4, 0>, <4, 0, 6>
