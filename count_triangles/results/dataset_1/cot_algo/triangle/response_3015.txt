Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we need to relabel the nodes based on their degree:
- Node 0 (1 connection) becomes Node A
- Node 1 (2 connections) becomes Node B
- Node 6 (1 connection) becomes Node C
- Node 3 (2 connections) becomes Node D
- Node 5 (2 connections) becomes Node E
- Node 2 (2 connections) becomes Node F
- Node 9 (3 connections) becomes Node G
- Node 4 (5 connections) becomes Node H

Next, we will analyze the edges in increasing order of the labels:
1. (A, D): No triangles.
2. (B, F): No triangles.
3. (B, C): No triangles.
4. (F, B): No triangles.
5. (F, H): Triangle <1, 2, 4>.
6. (D, A): No triangles.
7. (D, H): Triangle <0, 3, 4>.
8. (H, F): Triangle <2, 4, 9>.
9. (H, D): Triangle <3, 4, 9>.
10. (H, E): Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
11. (H, G): No triangles.
12. (E, H): No triangles.
13. (C, B): No triangles.
14. (G, H): Triangle <4, 5, 9>.
15. (G, E): No triangles.

Count of triangles = 4

Therefore, the number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, and <4, 5, 9>.
