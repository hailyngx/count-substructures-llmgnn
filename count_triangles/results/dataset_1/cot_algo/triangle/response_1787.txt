Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be restructured based on the degree-based ordering method as follows:
Vertices by degree: 
0: degree 1
1: degree 2
9: degree 2
5: degree 3
6: degree 3
2: degree 0
8: degree 4
7: degree 4
3: degree 5
4: degree 5

Edges to consider following degree-based ordering:
(0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 8), (8, 9)

Calculating the triangles:
- For edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 5> found.
- For edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 4): Triangle <3, 4, 7> found.
- For edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (3, 8): Triangle <3, 4, 8> found.
- For edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 9): Triangle <4, 8, 9> found.
- For edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 8): No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>.
