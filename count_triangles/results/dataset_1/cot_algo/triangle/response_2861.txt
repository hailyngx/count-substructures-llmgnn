Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Node 1 (1 connection): 1
Node 3 (2 connections): 3
Node 7 (2 connections): 7
Node 8 (2 connections): 8
Node 5 (3 connections): 5
Node 9 (4 connections): 9
Node 2 (4 connections): 2
Node 6 (4 connections): 6
Node 0 (5 connections): 0
Node 4 (6 connections): 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 6, 7>
5. Triangle <1, 3, 9>
6. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
7. Triangle <1, 4, 9>
8. Triangle <2, 0, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
10. Triangle <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
