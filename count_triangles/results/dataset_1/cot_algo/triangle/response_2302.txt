Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 2: 8 connections

Since we have 36 edges, we will now count the number of triangles using the information provided.

Looking at the edge list and considering the degree-based ordering, we check for shared connections to count triangles. 
The triangles found are as follows:
<4, 7, 9>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>

Counting these unique triangles, we find 3 triangles in total.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
