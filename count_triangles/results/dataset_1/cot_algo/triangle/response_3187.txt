Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 1

Following the degree-based ordering, we will consider the edges in the following order: (3,2), (4,2), (6,5), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2), (2,4), (2,3), (5,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (0,5), (0,4), (0,2).

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
