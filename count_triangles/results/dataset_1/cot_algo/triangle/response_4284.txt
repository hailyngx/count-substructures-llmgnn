Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 3 (degree 1)  
Node 2 (degree 1)  
Node 6 (degree 2)  
Node 5 (degree 2)  
Node 9 (degree 2)  
Node 1 (degree 2)  
Node 4 (degree 5)  
Node 8 (degree 5)  
Node 7 (degree 6)  
Node 0 (degree 6)  

Now, we can identify the triangles by examining the edges in the order provided and counting the triangles that can be formed:
- Edge (2, 7) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (3, 4) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (5, 7) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (6, 4) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 0) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (9, 1) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle: <1, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 0) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 6) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle: <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (8, 6) forms a triangle: <6, 8, 0>.
- Edge (4, 3) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle: <8, 9, 1>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle: <0, 7, 1>.
- Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle: <0, 8, 6>.
- Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle: <7, 8, 0>.
- Edge (7, 5) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (7, 2) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (4, 5) doesn't form any triangles.
- Edge (1, 9) doesn't form any triangles.

Count of triangles = 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <1, 7, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <6, 8, 0>, <8, 9, 1>, <0, 7, 1>, and <7, 8, 0>.
