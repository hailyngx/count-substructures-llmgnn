Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 7: 0 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 6: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge, considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Checking the edges: 
(0, 5) forms a triangle with 6 since they share 5 and 6.
(0, 6) forms a triangle with 5 since they share 6 and 5.

This results in a total of 2 triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>.
