Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Node Degrees:
0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Node Ordering:
1. Node 1 (degree 2)
2. Node 3 (degree 2)
3. Node 5 (degree 2)
4. Node 7 (degree 2)
5. Node 8 (degree 2)
6. Node 0 (degree 3)
7. Node 4 (degree 3)
8. Node 6 (degree 3)
9. Node 9 (degree 4)
10. Node 2 (degree 4)

Using the above ordering, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 8), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 9), (2, 9)

There are 4 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<6, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
