Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 -> 3 connections
1 -> 3 connections
3 -> 2 connections
6 -> 2 connections
8 -> 2 connections
5 -> 4 connections
4 -> 5 connections
2 -> 4 connections

Now, we will reorder the vertices with their new labels and restate the edges that follow the rule "proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections":

(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (3, 8) (4, 8)

Next, we will find the triangles in the graph:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 1, 5>
<1, 5, 3>
<5, 3, 8>
<4, 8, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
