Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are as follows:
Vertex 5: Degree 1
Vertices 1, 3, 8: Degree 2
Vertices 9: Degree 3
Vertices 0, 7: Degree 5
Vertices 2, 6: Degree 6
Vertex 4: Degree 7

Now, let's count the triangles:
For edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 4
For edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 2, 6
For edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 2, 4, 7
For edge (0, 7): Shared connections with 6
For edge (0, 8): No triangle
For edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 6
For edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 4, 7
For edge (1, 7): Shared connections with 6
For edge (2, 4): Shared connections with 0, 6
For edge (2, 6): Shared connections with 0, 1, 4, 7
For edge (2, 7): Shared connections with 0, 6
For edge (2, 8): No triangle
For edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 6
For edge (3, 6): Shared connections with 4, 9
For edge (4, 9): Shared connections with 3, 6
For edge (5, 6): No triangle
For edge (6, 9): Shared connections with 3, 4, 7

Count of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 9>
