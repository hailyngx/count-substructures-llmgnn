Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections:

Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Now, we can relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 1, 3, 4, 8 (2 connections) -> Node 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 5, 9 (4 connections) -> Node 6, 7
Node 6 (5 connections) -> Node 8

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
<0, 1, 6> - sharing node 5 [Triangle 1]
<0, 2, 5> - sharing node 7 [Triangle 2]
<0, 2, 7> - sharing node 4 [Triangle 3]
<1, 3, 4> - sharing node 6 [Triangle 4]
<1, 3, 7> - sharing node 9 [Triangle 5]
<1, 4, 5> - sharing node 6 [Triangle 6]
<1, 4, 7> - sharing node 2 [Triangle 7]
<1, 6, 8> - sharing node 5 [Triangle 8]
<2, 3, 5> - sharing node 1 [Triangle 9]
<3, 5, 7> - sharing node 9 [Triangle 10]
<4, 5, 6> - sharing node 1, 6 [Triangle 11]
<4, 6, 7> - sharing node 6 [Triangle 12]
<5, 6, 8> - sharing node 1, 4 [Triangle 13]
<6, 7, 8> - sharing node 5 [Triangle 14]
<6, 7, 8> - sharing node 9 [Triangle 15]
<7, 8, 9> - sharing node 6 [Triangle 16]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
