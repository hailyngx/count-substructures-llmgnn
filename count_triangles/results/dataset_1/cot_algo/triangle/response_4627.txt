Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, the new labeling for the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 1
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 2: degree 5
Vertex 8: degree 5
Vertex 6: degree 5
Vertex 4: degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is 23. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 8, 6>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 6>
<5, 8, 1>
<5, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 0>
<6, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 2>
<6, 8, 3>
<6, 8, 4>
<6, 8, 5>
<8, 9, 2>
<8, 9, 3>
<8, 9, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [23].
