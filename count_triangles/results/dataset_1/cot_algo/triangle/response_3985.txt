Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degrees of each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has degree 3
- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 2 has degree 2
- Vertex 3 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 5 has degree 3
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 1
- Vertex 8 has degree 1
- Vertex 9 has degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1 has the lowest degree, so it will be relabeled as 0
- Vertex 4, 7, 8, and 9 have the same degree, so they can be relabeled arbitrarily (let's choose them in increasing order), resulting in: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Vertex 2 and 9 have the same degree, so let's relabel them in increasing order: 5, 6
- Vertex 0, 3, and 6 have the highest degree, so let's relabel them in increasing order: 7, 8, 9

Now, the edges in the new labeling are:
- (0, 5)
- (0, 7)
- (0, 8)
- (1, 5)
- (5, 7)
- (5, 9)
- (5, 4)
- (2, 5)
- (3, 7)
- (3, 6)
- (6, 7)
- (7, 8)
- (8, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles by examining each edge:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <0, 5, 7>
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 5: <0, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
