Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
Vertex 0 -> Degree 4
Vertex 1 -> Degree 1
Vertex 2 -> Degree 3
Vertex 3 -> Degree 3
Vertex 4 -> Degree 5
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2
Vertex 6 -> Degree 4
Vertex 7 -> Degree 1
Vertex 8 -> Degree 4
Vertex 9 -> Degree 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

We will examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 2): Both share a connection with vertex 4. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>
(0, 4): Both share connections with vertices 2, 5, and 6. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 2>
(0, 5): Both share a connection with vertex 8. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
(0, 6): Both share connections with vertices 2, 3, and 4. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
(1, 4): No triangle formed as vertex 1 has fewer connections.
(2, 3): Both share a connection with vertex 6. Triangle formed: <2, 3, 6>
(2, 6): Both share a connection with vertex 4. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 6>
(3, 6): No triangle formed as vertex 3 has more connections.
(3, 8): No triangle formed as vertex 3 has more connections.
(4, 8): Both share a connection with vertex 9. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 9>
(4, 9): No triangle formed as vertex 4 has more connections.
(5, 8): No triangle formed as vertex 5 has fewer connections.
(6, 8): No triangle formed as vertex 6 has more connections.
(7, 9): No triangle formed as vertex 7 has fewer connections.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 4> <0, 5, 8> <0, 3, 6> <0, 4, 6> <4, 8, 9>
