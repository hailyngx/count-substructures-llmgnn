Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels are as follows:
Nodes: 4, 0, 7, 9, 1, 6, 5, 3, 2, 8

Triangles found:
<2, 0, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 1, 6>
<3, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [4]
