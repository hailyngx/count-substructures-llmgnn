Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels are:  

Node 0 has degree 4  
Node 1 has degree 2  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 6  
Node 5 has degree 4  
Node 6 has degree 5  
Node 7 has degree 1  
Node 8 has degree 2  
Node 9 has degree 2  

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will start counting triangles using the given edges.  

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles:
