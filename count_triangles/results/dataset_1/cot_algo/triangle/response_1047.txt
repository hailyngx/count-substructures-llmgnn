Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:
Vertices: 9, 6, 0, 5, 3, 4, 7, 1, 8, 2

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge:

Triangles: 
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<7, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [5]
