Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling is as follows:  
Node 0 has 2 connections.  
Node 9 has 2 connections.  
Node 3 has 2 connections.  
Node 6 has 2 connections.  
Node 1 has 2 connections.  
Node 5 has 4 connections.  
Node 7 has 4 connections.  
Node 4 has 5 connections.  
Node 2 has 6 connections.  


Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:  
(0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)  


Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 7>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 9>
