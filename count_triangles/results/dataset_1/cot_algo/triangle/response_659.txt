Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be: <6, 8, 3, 7, 0, 1, 2, 9, 4, 5>.

Let's proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 4): Shared connections: 5
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connections: 4
- Edge (1, 8): Shared connections: None
- Edge (1, 9): Shared connections: None
- Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0): Shared connections: 5
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connections: 0
- Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9): Shared connections: 1
- Edge (5, 0): Shared connections: 4
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connections: 4
- Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 4): Shared connections: 5
- Edge (7, 5): Shared connections: 4
- Edge (8, 1): Shared connections: None
- Edge (8, 6): Nodes 8 and 6 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1): Shared connections: None
- Edge (9, 4): Shared connections: 1

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 0>, <4, 7, 5>.
