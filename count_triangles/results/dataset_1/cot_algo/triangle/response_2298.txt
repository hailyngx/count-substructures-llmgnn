Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph with vertices sorted by their degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 0, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles:

Triangles: [<1, 7, 2>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 8, 6>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 8>]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
