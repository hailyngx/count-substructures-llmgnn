Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 9: 4

Sorted nodes based on degrees:
Node 3: 1
Node 2: 1
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 2
Node 4: 3
Node 6: 4
Node 5: 4
Node 9: 4
