Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 4: degree 0
Nodes 1 and 6: degree 1
Nodes 5 and 8: degree 2
Nodes 3 and 7: degree 3
Nodes 0 and 2: degree 4
Node 9: degree 7

Edges to consider based on the method:
(0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 0), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 9)

Calculating the triangles:
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <2, 0, 9>
- <7, 0, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
