Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be used to count the number of triangles in this graph.

1. Sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
- Vertex 1 (1): 1 connection
- Vertex 4 (2): 1 connection
- Vertex 5 (3): 2 connections
- Vertex 6 (4): 2 connections
- Vertex 7 (5): 2 connections
- Vertex 0 (6): 3 connections
- Vertex 2 (7): 3 connections
- Vertex 3 (8): 3 connections
- Vertex 8 (9): 1 connection
- Vertex 9 (10): 3 connections

3. Analyze each edge starting from vertices with lower labels and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Vertices 0 and 2 share vertex 9. <0, 2, 9>
- Edge (0, 7): Vertices 0 and 7 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (0, 9): Vertices 0 and 9 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (1, 7): Vertices 1 and 7 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (2, 5): Vertices 2 and 5 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertices 2 and 6 share vertex 3. <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (2, 6): Vertices 2 and 6 share vertex 3. Triangle already counted.
- Edge (3, 4): Vertices 3 and 4 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (3, 6): Vertices 3 and 6 share vertex 2. <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (3, 6): Vertices 3 and 6 share vertex 2. Triangle already counted.
- Edge (3, 9): Vertices 3 and 9 share vertex 0. <0, 3, 9>
- Edge (4, 3): Vertices 4 and 3 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (5, 2): Vertices 5 and 2 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (5, 8): Vertices 5 and 8 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (6, 2): Vertices 6 and 2 share vertex 3. Triangle already counted.
- Edge (6, 3): Vertices 6 and 3 share vertex 2. Triangle already counted.
- Edge (7, 0): Vertices 7 and 0 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (7, 1): Vertices 7 and 1 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (8, 5): Vertices 8 and 5 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (9, 0): Vertices 9 and 0 do not share any vertices.
- Edge (9, 3): Vertices 9 and 3 share vertex 0. Triangle already counted.

4. Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 9>
