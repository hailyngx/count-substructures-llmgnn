Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 5 connections.
- Node 3 has 6 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 7 has 5 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 9 has 3 connections.

Now, let's relabel the nodes from least to most connections:
- Node 4 (3 connections) -> Node A
- Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node B
- Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node C
- Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node D
- Node 1 (4 connections) -> Node E
- Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node F
- Node 2 (5 connections) -> Node G
- Node 7 (5 connections) -> Node H
- Node 9 (3 connections) -> Node I
- Node 3 (6 connections) -> Node J

Now, let's proceed with counting the triangles:
- Edge (A, B) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (A, C) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (A, D) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (A, E) forms a triangle: <4, 3, 1>.
- Edge (A, I) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (B, I) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (C, I) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (D, E) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (D, F) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (D, G) forms a triangle: <0, 3, 2>.
- Edge (D, H) forms a triangle: <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (D, J) forms a triangle: <0, 3, 6>.
- Edge (E, F) doesn't form a triangle.
- Edge (E, H) forms a triangle: <1, 3, 7>.
- Edge (F, G) forms a triangle: <0, 2, 6>.
- Edge (F, H) forms a triangle: <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (G, H) forms a triangle: <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (G, J) forms a triangle: <2, 3, 6>.
- Edge (H, J) forms a triangle: <3, 0, 1>.
- Edge (I, J) doesn't form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <4, 3, 1>, <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 7>.
