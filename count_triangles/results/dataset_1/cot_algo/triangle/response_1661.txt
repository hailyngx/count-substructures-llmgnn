Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Vertices: 8, 5, 0, 2, 5, 7, 1, 4, 6, 9 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles formed by the edges:
1. (0, 2): Shared connections with 3 and 7 - Triangle <0, 3, 7>
2. (0, 3): Shared connection with 7 - Triangle <0, 7, 3>
3. (0, 7): No triangles since 7 has more connections than 0

Total number of triangles: [2]
