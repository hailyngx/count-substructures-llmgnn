Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree of connections:

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection

Relabeling the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections

Next, we will check the edges (listed in the order given):

1. Check edge (0, 1):
    - Vertex 0 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 1 (degree 3), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {3, 5}
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>

2. Check edge (0, 3):
    - Vertex 0 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 3 (degree 3), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {1, 5}
    - Triangle formed: <0, 3, 1>

3. Check edge (0, 5):
    - Vertex 0 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 5 (degree 2), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {1, 3}
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 3>

4. Check edge (1, 0): (Already counted in edge (0, 1))

5. Check edge (1, 4):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 4 (degree 3), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {2}
    - Triangle formed: <1, 4, 2>

6. Check edge (1, 8):
    - Vertex 1 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 8 (degree 2), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {9}
    - Triangle formed: <1, 8, 9>

7. Check edge (2, 4):
    - Vertex 2 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Vertex 4 (degree 3), so skip.

8. Check edge (3, 0): (Already counted in edge (0, 3))

9. Check edge (3, 4):
    - Vertex 3 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 4 (degree 3), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {1}
    - Triangle formed: <3, 4, 1>

10. Check edge (3, 5):
    - Vertex 3 (degree 3) has more connections than Vertex 5 (degree 2), so proceed.
    - Shared connections: {0}
    - Triangle formed: <3, 5, 0>

11. Check edge (4, 1): (Already counted in edge (1, 4))

12. Check edge (4, 2): (Already counted in edge (2, 4))

13. Check edge (4, 3): (Already counted in edge (3, 4))

14. Check edge (5, 0): (Already counted in edge (0, 5))

15. Check edge (5, 3): (Already counted in edge (3, 5))

16. Check edge (6, 9):
    - Vertex 6 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Vertex 9 (degree 2), so skip.

17. Check edge (8, 1): (Already counted in edge (1, 8))

18. Check edge (8, 9):
    - Vertex 8 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Vertex 9 (degree 2), so skip.

19. Check edge (9, 6): (Already counted in edge (6, 9))

20. Check edge (9, 8): (Already counted in edge (8, 9))

The total number of triangles found is [5] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 5, 3>, <1, 4, 2>, and <1, 8, 9>.
