Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:



Vertex Degree:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 2
3: 3
4: 6
5: 1
6: 2
7: 2
8: 2
9: 4



Sorted vertices based on degree:
5 < 0, 1, 7, 8, 2, 6 < 9, 3 < 4



Triangles:
[7]



Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. The unique triangle found is <4, 6, 9>.
