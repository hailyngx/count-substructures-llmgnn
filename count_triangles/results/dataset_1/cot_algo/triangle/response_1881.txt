Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 5 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 6 edges

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order of their degrees:

- Node 0 -> Node 0 (2 edges)
- Node 4 -> Node 1 (2 edges)
- Node 7 -> Node 2 (2 edges)
- Node 1 -> Node 3 (3 edges)
- Node 3 -> Node 4 (3 edges)
- Node 8 -> Node 5 (3 edges)
- Node 6 -> Node 6 (4 edges)
- Node 2 -> Node 7 (4 edges)
- Node 5 -> Node 8 (5 edges)
- Node 9 -> Node 9 (6 edges)

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Checking the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
    - <0, 5> shares connections with Node 3 forming triangle <0, 3, 5>.
    - <1, 6> shares connections with Node 9 forming triangle <1, 6, 9>.
    - <2, 9> shares connections with Node 3 forming triangle <2, 3, 9>.
    - <3, 9> does not form a triangle.
    - <4, 9> shares connections with Node 1 forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.
    - <5, 8> does not form a triangle.
    - <6, 9> does not form a triangle.
    - <7, 8> does not form a triangle.
    - <8, 9> does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, and <1, 6, 9>.
