Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is: 

Nodes with their degrees:
1. 2 connections
2. 0 connections
3. 5 connections
4. 3 connections
5. 2 connections
6. 4 connections
7. 2 connections
8. 1 connection
9. 1 connection
10. 1 connection

Following the degree-based ordering, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(1, 2) - Not considered
(2, 3) - Not considered
(3, 4) - Considered (Forms a triangle with vertex 0)
(4, 7) - Considered (Forms a triangle with vertex 3)
(5, 6) - Not considered
(6, 7) - Not considered
(7, 8) - Not considered
(8, 9) - Not considered
(9, 10) - Not considered

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].

The unique triangles are:
<0, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 7>
