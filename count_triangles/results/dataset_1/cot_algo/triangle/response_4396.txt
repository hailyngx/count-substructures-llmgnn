Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
Nodes: 0 (degree 3), 4 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 9 (degree 2), 7 (degree 4), 5 (degree 4), 2 (degree 2), 3 (degree 2).

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge:
- (0, 2): No triangle.
- (0, 3): No triangle.
- (0, 5): <0, 5, 6>.
- (1, 7): No triangle.
- (1, 9): No triangle.
- (2, 0): No triangle.
- (2, 3): No triangle.
- (3, 0): No triangle.
- (3, 2): No triangle.
- (4, 6): No triangle.
- (4, 7): No triangle.
- (5, 0): <0, 5, 6>.
- (5, 6): <0, 5, 6>.
- (5, 7): <5, 7, 4>.
- (5, 9): No triangle.
- (6, 4): No triangle.
- (6, 5): <0, 5, 6>.
- (7, 1): No triangle.
- (7, 4): No triangle.
- (7, 5): <5, 7, 4>.
- (9, 1): No triangle.
- (9, 5): No triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 6>, <5, 7, 4>.
