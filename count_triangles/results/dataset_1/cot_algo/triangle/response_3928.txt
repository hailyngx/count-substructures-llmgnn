Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following relabeled vertices:
Vertices with labels in parentheses: (0) (2) (3) (7) (8) (5) (1) (6) (4) (9)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in this graph:
Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found: 
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 9, 6>
<2, 0, 5>
<4, 2, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
