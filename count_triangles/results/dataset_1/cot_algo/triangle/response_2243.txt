Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices by degree:
1. 3 (degree 1)
2. 7 (degree 1)
3. 9 (degree 1)
4. 1 (degree 2)
5. 8 (degree 2)
6. 6 (degree 3)
7. 0 (degree 4)
8. 5 (degree 4)
9. 4 (degree 4)
10. 2 (degree 5)

Now, we will go through each edge in the order given and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections, so check for shared connections. Shared connection at vertex 5. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Proceed.
3. Edge (0, 8): Proceed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Both vertices have fewer connections, so check for shared connections. No shared connections.
5. Edge (2, 0): Skip since we already counted edge (0, 2).
6. Edge (2, 4): Proceed.
7. Edge (2, 5): Proceed.
8. Edge (3, 4): Proceed.
9. Edge (4, 2): Skip since we already counted edge (2, 4).
10. Edge (4, 3): Skip since we already counted edge (3, 4).
11. Edge (4, 9): Proceed.
12. Edge (5, 1): Skip since we already counted edge (1, 5).
13. Edge (5, 2): Skip since we already counted edge (2, 5).
14. Edge (5, 6): Proceed.
15. Edge (5, 7): Proceed.
16. Edge (6, 0): Skip since we already counted edge (0, 6).
17. Edge (6, 5): Skip since we already counted edge (5, 6).
18. Edge (7, 5): Skip since we already counted edge (5, 7).
19. Edge (8, 0): Skip since we already counted edge (0, 8).
20. Edge (9, 4): Skip since we already counted edge (4, 9).

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 5>
