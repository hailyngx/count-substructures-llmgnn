Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
(0, degree 2) -> relabeled as 0
(1, degree 1) -> relabeled as 1
(3, degree 2) -> relabeled as 2
(4, degree 2) -> relabeled as 3
(7, degree 2) -> relabeled as 4
(9, degree 4) -> relabeled as 5
(8, degree 2) -> relabeled as 6
(2, degree 3) -> relabeled as 7
(6, degree 4) -> relabeled as 8
(5, degree 5) -> relabeled as 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles and their vertices are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 2>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
