Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node degrees:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 6
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5

Vertices in ascending order of degrees:
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 0, 9, 1

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
