Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are:
Vertices: 5, 6
Vertices: 2, 5, 6
Vertices: 0, 1, 4, 8
Vertices: 7
Vertices: 3
Vertices: 9
Vertices: 3
Vertices: 9

Now we will count the triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 8, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

[Count of triangles: 9]
