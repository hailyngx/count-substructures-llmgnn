Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertices: 7, 8 
Vertices: 0, 1, 3, 5 
Vertices: 9 
Vertices: 4, 6, 2 

The triangles formed are: 
<4, 2, 6>
<6, 2, 0>
<4, 2, 0>
<8, 5, 2>
<6, 1, 2>
<8, 6, 5>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
