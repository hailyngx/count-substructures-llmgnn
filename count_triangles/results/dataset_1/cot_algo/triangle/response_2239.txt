Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has 1 connection
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 2 has 2 connections
Vertex 6 has 2 connections
Vertex 1 has 3 connections
Vertex 8 has 3 connections
Vertex 7 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 4 connections
Vertex 9 has 4 connections
Vertex 4 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. The total number of triangles is [9]. 
The unique triangles found are as follows: 
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
