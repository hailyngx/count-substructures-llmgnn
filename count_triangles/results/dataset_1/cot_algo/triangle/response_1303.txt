Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 7 with 2 connections
- Node 4 with 2 connections
- Node 8 with 1 connection
- Node 5 with 2 connections
- Node 9 with 3 connections
- Node 1 with 3 connections
- Node 3 with 3 connections
- Node 2 with 4 connections
- Node 6 with 4 connections
- Node 0 with 4 connections

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

1. (1, 2): Shared connections with node 0 form triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. (1, 3): No triangle formed.
3. (1, 5): No triangle formed.
4. (2, 0): Shared connections with node 1 form triangle <0, 1, 2>.
5. (2, 1): Shared connections with node 0 form triangle <0, 1, 2>.
6. (2, 8): No triangle formed.
7. (3, 1): No triangle formed.
8. (3, 4): No triangle formed.
9. (3, 6): No triangle formed.
10. (4, 3): No triangle formed.
11. (4, 5): No triangle formed.
12. (5, 1): No triangle formed.
13. (5, 4): No triangle formed.
14. (6, 0): Shared connections with node 3 form triangle <0, 3, 6>.
15. (6, 3): No triangle formed.
16. (7, 0): No triangle formed.
17. (7, 9): No triangle formed.
18. (8, 2): No triangle formed.
19. (9, 0): No triangle formed.
20. (9, 7): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <0, 3, 6>.
