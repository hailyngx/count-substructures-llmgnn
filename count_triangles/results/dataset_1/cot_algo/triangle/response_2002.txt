Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph will be as follows:
- Node 7 has 2 edges.
- Nodes 6 and 4 have 5 edges each.
- Nodes 3 and 5 have 5 edges each.
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 6 edges each.
- Nodes 0 and 8 have 7 edges each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 7 -> Node 0
- Node 6 -> Node 1
- Node 4 -> Node 2
- Node 3 -> Node 3
- Node 5 -> Node 4
- Node 1 -> Node 5
- Node 9 -> Node 6
- Node 0 -> Node 7
- Node 8 -> Node 8
- Node 2 -> Node 9

Now, we will traverse the edges of the graph based on the relabeled nodes and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 1) forms triangles with (0, 2) and (1, 2).
2. Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with (0, 5).
3. Edge (0, 3) does not form any triangles since node 0 and node 3 do not have shared connections.
4. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with (4, 1).
5. Edge (0, 8) does not form any triangles since node 0 and node 8 do not have shared connections.

The total number of triangles found is 4, and the unique triangles are: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 5>, and <1, 2, 5>.
The final output is [4].
