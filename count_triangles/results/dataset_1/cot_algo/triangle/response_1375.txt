Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices by their degree:
Vertices in order from least connections: 1, 7
Vertices in order from most connections: 0, 5, 8, 6, 9, 4, 2, 3

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
