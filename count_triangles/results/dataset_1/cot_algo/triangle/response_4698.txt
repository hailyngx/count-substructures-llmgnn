Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 9 has degree 1

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the given graph are as follows:
[9 triangles]
