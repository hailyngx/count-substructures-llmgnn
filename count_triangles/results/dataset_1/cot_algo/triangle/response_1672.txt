Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 1)
Node 6 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 5)
Node 3 (Degree 5)
Node 4 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 4)
Node 0 (Degree 6)
Node 8 (Degree 6)
Node 9 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 5): Forms a triangle <1, 5, 2>
2. Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle <3, 2, 5>
3. Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle <4, 0, 7>
4. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle <4, 7, 0>
5. Edge (5, 1): Forms a triangle <5, 1, 2>
6. Edge (6, 5): No triangles formed
7. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle <7, 0, 4>
8. Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle <7, 4, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6].
