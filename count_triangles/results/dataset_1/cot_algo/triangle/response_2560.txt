Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 9, 7, 4, 0, 5, 2, 6, 1, 8, 3.
The edges that follow the rule of proceeding only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are: (1, 3), (1, 7), (4, 2), (5, 6), (6, 8).

By checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 7>

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
