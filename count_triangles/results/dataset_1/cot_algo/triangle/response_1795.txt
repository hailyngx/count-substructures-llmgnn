Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then assigning labels accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices with their corresponding number of connections:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
