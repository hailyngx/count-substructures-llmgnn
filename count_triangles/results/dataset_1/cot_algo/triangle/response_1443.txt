Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the vertices based on the number of connections:
Vertices with their degrees:
- Vertex 0: 2 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 3: 0 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 6: 4 connections
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 4 connections
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 3 connections

Now, we will check each edge with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 4): 
Both vertices have fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 6 forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

2. Edge (1, 9):
Vertex 1 has fewer connections so we proceed.
There are no triangles here.

3. Edge (2, 5):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

4. Edge (2, 6):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

5. Edge (2, 9):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

6. Edge (4, 0):
Vertex 0 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 6 forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

7. Edge (4, 6):
Vertex 4 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

8. Edge (5, 2):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

9. Edge (5, 8):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.

10. Edge (5, 9):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 8 forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.

11. Edge (6, 2):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

12. Edge (6, 4):
Vertex 4 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.

13. Edge (6, 7):
Vertex 6 has equal connections but we already counted the triangle <0, 4, 6> for this edge.

14. Edge (7, 6):
Vertex 6 has more connections so we skip this edge.

15. Edge (7, 8):
Vertex 7 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle <7, 8, 9>.

16. Edge (8, 5):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.

17. Edge (8, 7):
Vertex 7 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 9 forming a triangle <7, 8, 9>.

18. Edge (9, 1):
Vertex 1 has fewer connections so we proceed.
There are no triangles here.

19. Edge (9, 2):
Vertex 2 has more connections so we skip this edge.

20. Edge (9, 5):
Vertex 5 has fewer connections so we proceed.
They share a connection with vertex 8 forming a triangle <5, 8, 9>.

From the triangles found, we have counted 4 triangles in total: <0, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>, and <0, 4, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [4].
