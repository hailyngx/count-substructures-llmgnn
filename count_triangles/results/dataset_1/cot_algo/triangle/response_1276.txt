Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). 

The vertices with their corresponding degrees are as follows: 
Vertex 0 - Degree 3
Vertex 1 - Degree 2
Vertex 2 - Degree 3
Vertex 3 - Degree 1
Vertex 4 - Degree 2
Vertex 5 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 7 - Degree 2
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 9 - Degree 3

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order: 
Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
Vertex 2 (Degree 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)

Let's find the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 

Triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
