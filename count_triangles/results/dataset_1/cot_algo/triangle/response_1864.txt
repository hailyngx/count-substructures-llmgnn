Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 5 with degree 2  
Nodes 1 and 6 with degree 2  
Nodes 2, 3, and 4 with degree 3  
Nodes 0, 7, and 9 with degree 6  
Nodes 8 with degree 7  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph:  
For the pair of edges (0, 5) and (5, 0), we find the triangle <0, 5, 1>.  
For the pair of edges (0, 7) and (7, 0), we find the triangle <0, 7, 2>.  
For the pair of edges (0, 8) and (8, 0), we find the triangle <0, 8, 6>.  
For the pair of edges (0, 9) and (9, 0), we find the triangle <0, 9, 4>.  
For the pair of edges (1, 5) and (5, 1), we find the triangle <1, 5, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (1, 8) and (8, 1), we find the triangle <1, 8, 6>.  
For the pair of edges (1, 9) and (9, 1), we find the triangle <1, 9, 4>.  
For the pair of edges (2, 7) and (7, 2), we find the triangle <2, 7, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (2, 8) and (8, 2), we find the triangle <2, 8, 6>.  
For the pair of edges (3, 7) and (7, 3), we find the triangle <3, 7, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (4, 7) and (7, 4), we find the triangle <4, 7, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (4, 9) and (9, 4), we find the triangle <4, 9, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (6, 7) and (7, 6), we find the triangle <6, 7, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (6, 8) and (8, 6), we find the triangle <6, 8, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (7, 9) and (9, 7), we find the triangle <7, 9, 0>.  
For the pair of edges (8, 9) and (9, 8), we find the triangle <8, 9, 0>.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
