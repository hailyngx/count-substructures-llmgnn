Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge between nodes 1 and 2: One shared connection with node 2.
2. Edge between nodes 6 and 5: One shared connection with node 5.
3. Edge between nodes 8 and 7: One shared connection with node 7.
4. Edge between nodes 9 and 6: No triangle.
5. Edge between nodes 0 and 4: One shared connection with node 7.
6. Edge between nodes 0 and 5: One shared connection with node 3.
7. Edge between nodes 0 and 7: No triangle.
8. Edge between nodes 3 and 2: Two shared connections: nodes 0 and 4.
9. Edge between nodes 2 and 1: No triangle.
10. Edge between nodes 2 and 3: One shared connection with node 4.
11. Edge between nodes 2 and 4: Two shared connections: nodes 0 and 7.
12. Edge between nodes 3 and 5: One shared connection with node 0.
13. Edge between nodes 3 and 7: One shared connection with node 4.
14. Edge between nodes 4 and 7: One shared connection with node 0.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <2, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4>, <5, 6, 7>.
