Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes according to their degrees:

- Node 5 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
- Node 2 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
- Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 2
- Node 7 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 1 (degree 2) becomes Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
- Node 3 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 8 (degree 4) becomes Node 7
- Node 0 (degree 5) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 5) becomes Node 9

After relabeling, the edges now are: (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (1, 9) (2, 9) (6, 9) (5, 2) (9, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <4, 8, 0>
- Triangle <7, 8, 0>
- Triangle <4, 1, 9>
- Triangle <7, 4, 9>
- Triangle <3, 7, 4>
- Triangle <9, 3, 7>

So, the total number of triangles is [6].
