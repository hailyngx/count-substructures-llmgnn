Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles by examining each edge and checking for shared connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <5, 8, 9>
- <5, 8, 6>
- <5, 9, 6>
- <8, 9, 5>
