Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 7 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can identify the triangles in the graph:
- For node 1, there are no triangles since it has only 1 connection.
- For node 4, there are no triangles since it has only 1 connection.
- For node 5, there are no triangles since it has only 1 connection.
- For node 0, there are no triangles since it has 2 connections.
- For node 7, there is one triangle: <1, 3, 7>.
- For node 9, there is one triangle: <3, 8, 9>.
- For node 3, there are two triangles: <2, 3, 6>, <3, 6, 7>.
- For node 8, there are two triangles: <0, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 9>.
- For node 6, there are two triangles: <0, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 7>.
- For node 2, there are three triangles: <2, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14] and the unique triangles found are <1, 3, 7>, <3, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <0, 6, 8>, and <2, 6, 7>.
