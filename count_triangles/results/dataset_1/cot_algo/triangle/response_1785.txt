Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 9 has 4 connections.
- Node 1 has 5 connections.
- Node 3 has 4 connections.
- Node 4 has 4 connections.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the following order: 
(7, 5), (0, 4), (8, 0), (8, 5), (2, 9), (5, 1), (6, 2), (5, 8), (1, 9), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 0).

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 3>

<2, 9, 1>
<1, 6, 2>
<1, 9, 3>
<3, 4, 0>
