Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order. The sorted vertices are: 

Node 9 - Degree 1
Node 6 - Degree 2
Node 5 - Degree 3
Node 4 - Degree 3
Node 1 - Degree 3
Node 0 - Degree 4
Node 2 - Degree 4
Node 8 - Degree 4
Node 3 - Degree 5
Node 7 - Degree 6

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms triangle <0, 3, 2>
- Edge (0, 4): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (0, 7): Forms triangle <0, 7, 2>

- Edge (1, 4): Forms triangle <1, 4, 5>
- Edge (1, 8): Forms triangle <1, 8, 7>
- Edge (1, 9): Does not form a triangle

- Edge (2, 3): Forms triangle <2, 3, 0>
- Edge (2, 5): Forms triangle <2, 5, 4>
- Edge (2, 7): Forms triangle <2, 7, 0>

- Edge (3, 6): Forms triangle <3, 6, 7>

- Edge (4, 5): Does not form a triangle

- Edge (5, 8): Forms triangle <5, 8, 1>

- Edge (6, 7): Does not form a triangle

- Edge (7, 8): Forms triangle <7, 8, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 7, 2>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 8, 7>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 5, 4>, <2, 7, 0>, <3, 6, 7>, <5, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 1>.
