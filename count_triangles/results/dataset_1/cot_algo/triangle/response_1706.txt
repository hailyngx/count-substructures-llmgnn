Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 3
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 4
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 4 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 5
Vertex 5 has degree 6

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

- Considering edge (0, 5):
  Vertex 0 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6).
  Shared connections of vertices 0 and 5 are vertices 1 and 4.
  Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 4> is found.

- Considering edge (1, 4):
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 4 (degree 5).
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 4 are vertices 2 and 5.
  Therefore, triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.

- Considering edge (1, 5):
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6).
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 5 are vertices 4 and 0.
  Therefore, triangle <1, 4, 0> is found.

- Considering edge (1, 9):
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 3).
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 9 are vertices 2 and 5.

- Considering edge (5, 0):
  Vertex 0 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6).
  Shared connections of vertices 0 and 5 are vertices 1 and 4.
  Therefore, triangle <0, 1, 4> is found.

- Considering edge (5, 1):
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 6).
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 5 are vertices 4 and 0.
  Therefore, triangle <1, 4, 0> is found.

- Considering edge (5, 6):

  Vertex 5 (degree 6) has more connections than vertex 6 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (5, 9):
  Vertex 5 (degree 6) has more connections than vertex 9 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (6, 4):
  Vertex 4 (degree 5) has more connections than vertex 6 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (6, 5):
  Vertex 5 (degree 6) has more connections than vertex 6 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (6, 7):
  Vertex 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4).
  Shared connections of vertices 6 and 7 are vertices 2 and 3.
  Therefore, triangle <6, 2, 3> is found.

- Considering edge (7, 2):
  Vertex 2 (degree 5) has more connections than vertex 7 (degree 4), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (7, 3):
  Vertex 3 (degree 4) has more connections than vertex 7 (degree 4), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (7, 6):
  Vertex 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4).
  Shared connections of vertices 6 and 7 are vertices 2 and 3.
  Therefore, triangle <6, 2, 3> is found.

- Considering edge (9, 1):
  Vertex 1 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 3).
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 9 are vertices 2 and 5.
  Therefore, triangle <1, 2, 5> is found.

- Considering edge (9, 2):
  Vertex 2 (degree 5) has more connections than vertex 9 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

- Considering edge (9, 5):
  Vertex 5 (degree 6) has more connections than vertex 9 (degree 3), so we do not proceed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 0>, and <6, 2, 3>.
