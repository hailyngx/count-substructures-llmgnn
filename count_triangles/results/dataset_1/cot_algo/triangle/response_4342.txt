Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0 - Degree 1 (1 connection)
Node 1 - Degree 2 (2 connections)
Node 7 - Degree 2 (2 connections)
Node 8 - Degree 2 (2 connections)
Node 3 - Degree 0 (0 connections)
Node 6 - Degree 3 (3 connections)
Node 2 - Degree 4 (4 connections)
Node 4 - Degree 4 (4 connections)
Node 5 - Degree 4 (4 connections)
Node 9 - Degree 4 (4 connections)

Now we will count the number of triangles in the graph by considering each edge: 

Edge (0, 6):
- Node 0 and Node 6 share Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 6>

Edge (1, 5):
- Node 1 and Node 5 share Node 9, forming a triangle: <1, 5, 9>

Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.

Edge (2, 4): No triangles formed.

Edge (2, 5):
- Node 2 and Node 5 share Node 6, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>

Edge (2, 6):
- Node 2 and Node 6 share Node 0, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Node 2 and Node 6 share Node 5, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>

Edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.

Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.

Edge (5, 1): No triangles formed.

Edge (5, 2):
- Node 5 and Node 2 share Node 6, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>

Edge (5, 6):
- Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 0, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 6>
- Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 2, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>
- Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 8, forming a triangle: <5, 6, 8>

Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.

Edge (6, 0):
- Node 6 and Node 0 share Node 2, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 6>

Edge (6, 2):
- Node 6 and Node 2 share Node 0, forming a triangle: <0, 2, 6>
- Node 6 and Node 2 share Node 5, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>

Edge (6, 5):
- Node 6 and Node 5 share Node 0, forming a triangle: <0, 5, 6>
- Node 6 and Node 5 share Node 2, forming a triangle: <2, 5, 6>
- Node 6 and Node 5 share Node 8, forming a triangle: <5, 6, 8>

Edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.

Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.

Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.

Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.

Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.

Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.

Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles is [8].
