Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices is: 4, 5, 9, 3, 1, 2, 6, 8, 7, 0.

Next, we analyze each edge starting from the one with the vertex of lower label and fewer connections.

1. Edge (4, 6): Vertices 4 and 6 have a common connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
2. Edge (5, 3): Vertices 5 and 3 have a common connection with vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
3. Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has no common connection with vertex 1.
4. Edge (3, 0): Vertices 3 and 0 have common connections with vertices 6 and 7, forming triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 7>.
5. Edge (1, 6): Vertex 6 has common connections with vertices 4 and 0, forming a triangle <0, 4, 6>.
6. Edge (2, 7): Vertex 2 has no common connection with vertex 7.
7. Edge (6, 0): Vertices 6 and 0 have common connections with vertices 3 and 7, forming triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 6, 7>.
8. Edge (8, 0): Vertex 8 has common connections with vertices 6 and 7, forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
9. Edge (7, 0): Vertices 7 and 0 have common connections with vertices 3, 6, and 8, forming triangles <0, 3, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, and <0, 7, 8>.
10. Edge (0, 3): Vertices 0 and 3 have common connections with vertices 6 and 7, forming triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 7>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
