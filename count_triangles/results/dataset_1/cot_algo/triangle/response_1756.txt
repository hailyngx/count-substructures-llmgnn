Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 1, 5, 8, 6, 9, 2, 3, 7, 0, 4.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the number of triangles by looking at each edge and checking for shared connections between the two vertices. 

After examining all edges, we can find the triangles:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 5>
<6, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
