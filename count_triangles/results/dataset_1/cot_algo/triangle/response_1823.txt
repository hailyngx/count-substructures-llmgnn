Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks like this:

Vertices: 4, 7, 8, 1, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2

The edges that we will analyze following the degree-based ordering are:
(4, 2), (7, 5), (8, 7), (1, 3), (9, 3), (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 3), (3, 1), (6, 5), (5, 1)

By examining these edges, we find the following triangles:
<2, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
