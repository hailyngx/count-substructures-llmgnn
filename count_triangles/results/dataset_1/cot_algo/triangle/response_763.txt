Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first list the vertices in increasing order of their connections:
Vertices: 3, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 2
Edges used: (3, 6), (4, 7), (0, 2), (1, 5), (6, 8), (4, 1), (4, 8), (1, 4), (1, 2), (8, 2), (8, 6), (1, 8)

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles:
