Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their connections in ascending order:
Vertices: 3, 1, 8, 9, 2, 6, 4, 5, 0, 7

Next, we will relabel the vertices:
Vertex 3 -> A (Degree: 1)
Vertex 1 -> B (Degree: 1)
Vertex 8 -> C (Degree: 1)
Vertex 9 -> D (Degree: 1)
Vertex 2 -> E (Degree: 2)
Vertex 6 -> F (Degree: 2)
Vertex 4 -> G (Degree: 4)
Vertex 5 -> H (Degree: 4)
Vertex 0 -> I (Degree: 4)
Vertex 7 -> J (Degree: 7)

Now we will identify the triangles:
1. (0, 4) & (0, 7) -> Shared connection: 4, Triangle: <0, 4, 7>
2. (4, 0) & (4, 6) -> Shared connection: 4, Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
3. (5, 3) & (5, 7) -> Shared connection: 5, Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
4. (5, 3) & (5, 8) -> Shared connection: 5, Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
5. (7, 1) & (7, 2) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <1, 2, 7>
6. (7, 2) & (7, 4) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <2, 4, 7>
7. (7, 0) & (7, 1) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
8. (7, 1) & (7, 9) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
9. (7, 2) & (7, 5) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
10. (7, 4) & (7, 5) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <4, 5, 7>
11. (7, 2) & (7, 9) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <2, 7, 9>
12. (7, 4) & (7, 9) -> Shared connection: 7, Triangle: <4, 7, 9>

By counting the triangles, the total number of triangles found is [12].
