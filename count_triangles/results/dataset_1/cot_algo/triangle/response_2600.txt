Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
1. Vertex 1 (Degree: 2)
2. Vertex 5 (Degree: 2)
3. Vertex 7 (Degree: 2)
4. Vertex 9 (Degree: 2)
5. Vertex 0 (Degree: 4)
6. Vertex 6 (Degree: 4)
7. Vertex 8 (Degree: 4)
8. Vertex 2 (Degree: 5)
9. Vertex 4 (Degree: 5)
10. Vertex 3 (Degree: 0) [Extra disconnected vertex with label 3]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 6>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 8, 0>
<4, 8, 2>
<4, 8, 6>
<2, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
