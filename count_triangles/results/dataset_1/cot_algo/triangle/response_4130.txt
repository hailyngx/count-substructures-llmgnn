Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph:
Node 4 has 0 connections.
Nodes 0, 4, and 7 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 5 and 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 1 and 8 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 6 have 5 connections each.
