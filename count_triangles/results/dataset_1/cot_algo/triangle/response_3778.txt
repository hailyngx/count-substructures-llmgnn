Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 5 - Degree: 1
Vertex 8 - Degree: 1
Vertex 9 - Degree: 1
Vertex 1 - Degree: 2
Vertex 2 - Degree: 2
Vertex 7 - Degree: 2
Vertex 4 - Degree: 3
Vertex 6 - Degree: 4
Vertex 3 - Degree: 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges:
1. (1, 3): Vertex 1 and Vertex 2 have a shared connection with Vertex 3. Triangle formed: <1, 2, 3>
2. (1, 6): Vertex 1 has a shared connection with Vertex 6. No new triangle formed.
3. (2, 6): Vertex 2 has a shared connection with Vertex 6. No new triangle formed.
4. (2, 8): Vertex 2 and Vertex 8 have no shared connections.
5. (3, 1): Already counted.
6. (3, 4): Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 have no shared connections.
7. (3, 7): Vertex 3 has a shared connection with Vertex 7. No new triangle formed.
8. (3, 9): Vertex 3 and Vertex 9 have no shared connections.
9. (4, 3): Already counted.
10. (4, 6): Vertex 4 has a shared connection with Vertex 6. No new triangle formed.
11. (5, 7): Vertex 5 and Vertex 7 have a shared connection. Triangle formed: <5, 7, 3>
12. (6, 1): Already counted.
13. (6, 2): Already counted.
14. (6, 4): Already counted.
15. (7, 3): Already counted.
16. (7, 5): Already counted.
17. (8, 2): Already counted.
18. (9, 3): Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <1, 2, 3>, <5, 7, 3>
