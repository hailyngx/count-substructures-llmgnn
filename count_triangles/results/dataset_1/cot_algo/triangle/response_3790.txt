Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 2
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 3

Sorting nodes by degree in ascending order: 8, 3, 7, 2, 9, 0, 5, 6, 1

Edges to consider following Degree-Based Ordering:
(1, 8)
(3, 7)
(2, 9)
(0, 5) - Proceed
(0, 6) - Proceed
(5, 6) - Proceed
(5, 1) - Proceed
(6, 1) - Proceed
(1, 9) - Proceed
(1, 2) - Proceed
(0, 7) - Proceed
(2, 7) - Proceed
(1, 6) - Proceed
(2, 5) - Proceed
(3, 6) - Proceed
(0, 3) - Proceed

Count of triangles: 9
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 9>, <2, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 1>, <6, 1, 5>, <0, 3, 6>
