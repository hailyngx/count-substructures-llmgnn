Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 
Vertex 0 with connections [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] 
Vertex 1 with connections [3, 6, 9] 
Vertex 2 with connections [0, 3, 5, 7] 
Vertex 3 with connections [1, 2, 4, 6, 9] 
Vertex 4 with connections [0, 3, 5, 7] 
Vertex 5 with connections [0, 2, 4] 
Vertex 6 with connections [0, 1, 3, 8] 
Vertex 7 with connections [0, 2, 4] 
Vertex 8 with connections [0, 6, 9] 
Vertex 9 with connections [1, 3, 8]

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles. The triangles in the given graph are as follows:

[Total number of triangles: 8]
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
