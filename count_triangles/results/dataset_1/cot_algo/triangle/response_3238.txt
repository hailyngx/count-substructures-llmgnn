Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Vertex 2: Degree 2
Vertex 1: Degree 2
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 7: Degree 2
Vertex 9: Degree 2
Vertex 0: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 3
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 7

Following the degree-based ordering, we start counting triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 -> <0, 3, 1>
2. Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 -> <0, 4, 3>
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed
5. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed
6. Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 -> <1, 4, 0>
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed
8. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed
9. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed
10. Edge (3, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 1 -> <3, 0, 1>
11. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed
12. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed
13. Edge (3, 4): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 -> <3, 4, 0>
14. Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 -> <3, 6, 0>
15. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed
16. Edge (4, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 -> <4, 0, 3>
17. Edge (4, 1): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 -> <4, 1, 0>
18. Edge (4, 3): No triangle formed
19. Edge (4, 9): No triangle formed
20. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed
21. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed
22. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed
23. Edge (6, 0): Forms a triangle with shared connection 3 -> <6, 0, 3>
24. Edge (6, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 0 -> <6, 3, 0>
25. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed
26. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed
27. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed
28. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed
29. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed
30. Edge (8, 7): No triangle formed
31. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed
32. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed

The total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <0, 4, 3>, <1, 4, 0>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 4, 0>, <3, 6, 0>, <4, 0, 3>, <6, 0, 3>.
