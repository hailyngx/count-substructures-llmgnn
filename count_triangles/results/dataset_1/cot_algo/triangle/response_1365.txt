Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: degree 2
1: degree 2
2: degree 3
6: degree 3
8: degree 1
4: degree 3
9: degree 3
5: degree 4
7: degree 4
3: degree 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

0: degree 2 -> A
1: degree 2 -> B
2: degree 3 -> C
6: degree 3 -> D
8: degree 1 -> E
4: degree 3 -> F
9: degree 3 -> G
5: degree 4 -> H
7: degree 4 -> I
3: degree 6 -> J

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(A, H) - shared connections: 5
(B, D) - no shared connections
(C, F) - shared connections: 2, 4
(C, G) - shared connections: 2, 9
(D, I) - shared connections: 7
(F, H) - shared connections: 5, 4
(F, I) - shared connections: 5
(F, G) - shared connections: 2
(H, I) - shared connections: 5, 7
(I, J) - shared connections: 3, 7

Calculating the total number of triangles, we find [9 triangles] in the graph:

<2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 9, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 6>
