Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 4: degree 0
Node 0: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles:
1. For edge (0, 8) - Node 0 and Node 8 share Node 6 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
2. For edge (0, 9) - Node 0 and Node 9 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
3. For edge (1, 2) - Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
4. For edge (1, 3) - Node 1 and Node 3 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
5. For edge (1, 9) - Node 1 and Node 9 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
6. For edge (2, 1) - Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
7. For edge (2, 5) - Node 2 and Node 5 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
8. For edge (2, 6) - Node 2, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
9. For edge (2, 7) - Node 2 and Node 7 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
10. For edge (3, 1) - Node 1 and Node 3 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
11. For edge (3, 6) - Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <3, 6, 7>.
12. For edge (3, 7) - Node 3 and Node 7 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
13. For edge (5, 2) - Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 form a triangle <2, 5, 9>.
14. For edge (5, 9) - Node 5 and Node 9 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
15. For edge (6, 2) - Node 2, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
16. For edge (6, 3) - Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <3, 6, 7>.
17. For edge (6, 7) - Node 6 and Node 7 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
18. For edge (6, 8) - Node 6 and Node 8 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
19. For edge (7, 2) - Node 2, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <2, 6, 7>.
20. For edge (7, 3) - Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 form a triangle <3, 6, 7>.
21. For edge (7, 6) - Node 6 and Node 7 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
22. For edge (7, 8) - Node 7 and Node 8 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
23. For edge (8, 0) - Node 0 and Node 8 share Node 6 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
24. For edge (8, 6) - Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 form a triangle <6, 7, 8>.
25. For edge (8, 7) - Node 7 and Node 8 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
26. For edge (9, 0) - Node 0 and Node 9 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
27. For edge (9, 1) - Node 1 and Node 9 do not form a triangle due to the ordering.
28. For edge (9, 5) - Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9 form a triangle <2, 5, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is: [4]
