Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Degree-Based Ordering
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Reorder the vertices: 6, 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 3, 4, 5

Step 2: Count Triangles
Starting with the lowest labeled vertex 6:
- 6 has 1 connection, no triangles
Move to vertex 0:
- 0 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 1:
- 1 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 2:
- 2 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 7:
- 7 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 8:
- 8 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 9:
- 9 has 2 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 3:
- 3 has 3 connections, forming triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>
Move to vertex 4:
- 4 has 3 connections, no triangles
Move to vertex 5:
- 5 has 3 connections, forming triangles: <1, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <1, 5, 8>
