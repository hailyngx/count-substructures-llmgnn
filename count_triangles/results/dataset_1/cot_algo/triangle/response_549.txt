Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling becomes: 

Node 1 has degree 3  

Node 2 has degree 1  

Node 3 has degree 4  

Node 4 has degree 4  

Node 5 has degree 3  

Node 6 has degree 3  

Node 7 has degree 2  

Node 9 has degree 4  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges only for pairs where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles. The total number of triangles is 4.

The unique triangles found are:

<1, 4, 5>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles found in the given graph is [4].
