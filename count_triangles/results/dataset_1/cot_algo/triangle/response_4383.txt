Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) from least to most. The sorted order of vertices from least connected to most connected is: 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 0, 6, 3, 8, 1.

After relabeling the vertices based on the sorting, the new edge list becomes: (7, 1), (4, 1), (9, 2), (5, 1), (2, 1), (0, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1), (8, 7), (1, 2), (7, 8), (4, 2), (2, 9), (6, 5), (3, 4), (8, 6), (1, 3), (9, 5), (0, 6), (6, 8), (7, 3), (8, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 6), (1, 5), (7, 8), (3, 6), (5, 9), (4, 9), (0, 8), (8, 9), (0, 9).

Now, we can count the triangles by looking at each edge. When the lower labeled vertex in an edge has fewer connections, we look for shared connections between the two vertices of the edge to form triangles.

Count of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles: <1, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9>
