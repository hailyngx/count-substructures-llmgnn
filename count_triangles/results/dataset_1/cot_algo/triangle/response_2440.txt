Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Vertices: 0(2), 2(1), 3(1), 5(1), 9(1), 7(1), 8(2), 6(4), 1(4), 4(5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0(0), 2(1), 3(2), 5(3), 9(4), 7(5), 8(6), 6(7), 1(8), 4(9)

Now, we will go through the edges to count the triangles:
(0, 8): -
(1, 4): <1, 4, 6>
(1, 5): -
(1, 6): -
(2, 6): -
(3, 8): -
(4, 1): -
(4, 6): <1, 4, 6>
(4, 7): -
(4, 9): <1, 4, 9>
(5, 1): -
(6, 1): -
(6, 2): -
(6, 4): <1, 4, 6>
(7, 4): -
(8, 0): -
(8, 3): -
(9, 4): <1, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 9>
