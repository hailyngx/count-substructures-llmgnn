Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree:

| Vertex | Degree |
|--------|--------|
|   3    |   2    |
|   0    |   3    |
|   1    |   3    |
|   6    |   3    |
|   5    |   4    |
|   4    |   5    |
|   9    |   5    |
|   7    |   5    |
|   8    |   5    |
|   2    |   5    |

Next, we will relabel the vertices:

| Original Label | New Label |
|----------------|-----------|
|        3       |     0     |
|        0       |     1     |
|        1       |     2     |
|        6       |     3     |
|        5       |     4     |
|        4       |     5     |
|        9       |     6     |
|        7       |     7     |
|        8       |     8     |
|        2       |     9     |

Now, we will process the edges based on the relabeled vertices:

1. Edge (1, 5) forms triangle <1, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (1, 8) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 9) forms triangle <1, 2, 6>.
4. Edge (2, 4) forms triangle <2, 4, 5>.
5. Edge (2, 7) forms triangle <2, 4, 7>.
6. Edge (2, 8) forms triangle <2, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
9. Edge (4, 8) forms triangle <4, 7, 8>.
10. Edge (4, 9) forms triangle <4, 6, 7>.
11. Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (7, 9) forms triangle <7, 8, 9>.
14. Edge (8, 9) forms triangle <4, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9], and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <4, 7, 8>, <4, 6, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
