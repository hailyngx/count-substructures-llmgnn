Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degrees of each vertex in the graph:

- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 5
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 6

Next, we will sort the vertices by their degrees in ascending order and relabel them:

- Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> relabeled as vertex 0
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) -> relabeled as vertex 1
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled as vertex 2
- Vertex 3 (degree 3) -> relabeled as vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (degree 3) -> relabeled as vertex 4
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) -> relabeled as vertex 5
- Vertex 9 (degree 6) -> relabeled as vertex 6
- Vertex 2 (degree 5) -> relabeled as vertex 7

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the relabeled vertices according to the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2) - Proceed since 0 < 7 and they have a shared connection with 9.
2. Edge (0, 5) - Proceed since 0 < 1 and they have a shared connection with 9.
3. Edge (0, 9) - Proceed since 0 < 6 and they have shared connections with 2 and 5, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
4. Edge (1, 3) - Proceed since 1 < 3 and they have a shared connection with 4.
5. Edge (1, 4) - Proceed since 1 < 4 and they have shared connections with 3 and 2, forming a triangle <1, 3, 2>.
6. Edge (2, 4) - Proceed since 2 < 4 and they have shared connections with 0 and 9, forming a triangle <2, 0, 9>.
7. Edge (2, 8) - Proceed since 2 < 2 and they have a shared connection with 9.
8. Edge (2, 9) - Proceed since 2 < 6 and they have shared connections with 0 and 4, forming a triangle <2, 0, 4>.
9. Edge (3, 1) - Proceed since 3 < 1 and they have a shared connection with 2.
10. Edge (3, 5) - Proceed since 3 < 1 and they have shared connections with 2 and 9, forming a triangle <3, 2, 9>.
11. Edge (3, 9) - Proceed since 3 < 6 and they have shared connections with 0 and 5, forming a triangle <3, 0, 5>.
12. Edge (4, 1) - Proceed since 4 < 1 and they have a shared connection with 2.
13. Edge (4, 2) - Proceed since 4 < 2 and they have shared connections with 1 and 0, forming a triangle <4, 1, 0>.
14. Edge (4, 9) - Proceed since 4 < 6 and they have shared connections with 1 and 0, forming a triangle <4, 1, 0>.
15. Edge (5, 0) - Proceed since 1 < 5 and they have a shared connection with 9.
16. Edge (5, 3) - Proceed since 1 < 3 and they have shared connections with 0 and 9, forming a triangle <5, 0, 9>.
17. Edge (8, 2) - Not applicable since 2 >= 2.
18. Edge (8, 9) - Proceed since 2 < 6 and they have a shared connection with 2.
19. Edge (9, 0) - Proceed since 6 < 5 and they have shared connections with 2 and 5, forming a triangle <9, 2, 5>.
20. Edge (9, 2) - Proceed since 6 < 7 and they have shared connections with 0 and 4, forming a triangle <9, 0, 4>.
21. Edge (9, 3) - Proceed since 6 < 3 and they have shared connections with 0 and 5, forming a triangle <9, 0, 5>.
22. Edge (9, 4) - Proceed since 6 < 4 and they have shared connections with 0 and 1, forming a triangle <9, 0, 1>.
23. Edge (9, 8) - Proceed since 6 < 2 and they have a shared connection with 2.
