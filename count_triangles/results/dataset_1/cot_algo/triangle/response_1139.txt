Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: Not present
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 7: 3 connections
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: Not present
- Vertex 10: Not present

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 1 (2 connections) -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (2 connections) -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 4 (3 connections) -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 5 (2 connections) -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 6 (3 connections) -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 7 (3 connections) -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 8 (2 connections) -> Vertex 7

Using the sorted vertices, let's go through the edges to count the triangles:
1. Edge (1, 7): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.
2. Edge (2, 6): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.
3. Edge (4, 5): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.
4. Edge (4, 7): Triangle found: <3, 4, 6>
5. Edge (5, 4): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.
6. Edge (6, 2): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.
7. Edge (6, 8): Triangle found: <5, 6, 7>
8. Edge (7, 1): Triangle found: <1, 6, 5>
9. Edge (7, 4): Triangle found: <3, 6, 4>
10. Edge (8, 6): No triangle since the condition is not satisfied.

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles: <3, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 4>
