Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following new labels for each vertex:
Vertex 0 has 3 connections,
Vertex 1 has 4 connections,
Vertex 3 has 3 connections,
Vertex 5 has 3 connections,
Vertex 4 has 3 connections,
Vertex 6 has 3 connections,
Vertex 7 has 3 connections,
Vertex 9 has 2 connections,
Vertex 2 has 5 connections,
Vertex 8 has 6 connections.

We will now go through the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method. 

Checking the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 4, 1>.
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 3: <1, 8, 3>.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (3, 2) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <4, 0, 1>.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (5, 0) forms a triangle with shared connection 7: <5, 0, 7>.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (6, 0) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle. 
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
