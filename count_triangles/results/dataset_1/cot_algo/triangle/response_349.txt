Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.

Sorting the nodes based on their connections in ascending order:
0 < 3 < 1, 2 < 8 < 4, 5 < 6.

Checking the edges while ensuring the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 8): Both nodes are in correct order and form a triangle with node 3. <0, 3, 8>
- Edge (1, 5): Both nodes are in correct order, and they share node 6, forming a triangle. <1, 5, 6>
- Edge (1, 6): Both nodes are in correct order, and they share node 5, forming a triangle. <1, 5, 6>
- Edge (2, 4): Both nodes are in correct order and form a triangle with node 5. <2, 4, 5>
- Edge (3, 8): Both nodes are in correct order and form a triangle with node 0. <0, 3, 8>
- Edge (4, 2): Node 4 has more connections than node 2, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (4, 5): Node 4 has more connections than node 5, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has more connections than node 6, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (5, 1): Node 5 has more connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (5, 4): Node 5 has more connections than node 4, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 has more connections than node 6, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (6, 1): Node 6 has more connections than node 1, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (6, 4): Node 6 has more connections than node 4, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (6, 5): Node 6 has more connections than node 5, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 has more connections than node 8, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (8, 0): Node 8 has more connections than node 0, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (8, 3): Node 8 has more connections than node 3, so we skip this edge.
- Edge (8, 6): Node 8 has more connections than node 6, so we skip this edge.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>, <1, 5, 6>
