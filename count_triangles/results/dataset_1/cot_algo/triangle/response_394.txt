Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. 
Here is the list of vertices sorted by their number of connections:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
4 (degree 1)
3 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
5 (degree 3)
8 (degree 3)
2 (degree 4)
7 (degree 4)
 
Now we will examine each edge to count the triangles based on the method described earlier. 

1. (0, 4):
   Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
   Node 4 is not connected to any other vertex.

2. (0, 7):
   Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
   Shared connections between nodes 0 and 7: 1 (node 4)

   Triangle found: <2, 7, 9>

7. (2, 9):
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
   Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   Shared connections between nodes 2 and 9: 1 (node 7)

8. (3, 8):
   Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.

9. (4, 0): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

10. (5, 1): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

11. (5, 7):
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
   Shared connections between nodes 5 and 7: 2 (nodes 1 and 8)

12. (5, 8):
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   Shared connections between nodes 5 and 8: 1 (node 7)
   Triangle found: <5, 7, 8> 

13. (7, 0): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

14. (7, 2): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

15. (7, 5): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

16. (7, 8):

17. (8, 3):
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

18. (8, 5):
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
   Shared connections between nodes 8 and 5: 1 (node 7)
   Triangle found: <5, 7, 8> 

19. (8, 7):
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
   Shared connections between nodes 8 and 7: 1 (node 5)
   Triangle found: <5, 7, 8>

20. (9, 1): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

21. (9, 2): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

22. (9, 7): Skipped due to the lower label having more connections.

After examining all the edges based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find a total of 3 unique triangles in the graph: <0, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
