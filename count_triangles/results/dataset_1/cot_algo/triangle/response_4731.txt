Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the vertices is as follows:
Node 3: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 2
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 2: degree 4
Node 5: degree 5
Node 4: degree 6
Node 6: degree 6

Following the degree-based ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Looking at the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has fewer connections than Node 2. No triangles are formed.
- Looking at the edge (0, 7): Node 0 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (1, 5): Node 1 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (1, 6): Node 1 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (1, 7): Node 1 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (2, 0): Node 0 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (2, 4): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (2, 9): Node 2 has fewer connections. A triangle is formed: <2, 4, 9>.
- Looking at the edge (3, 5): Node 3 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (3, 6): Node 3 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 2): Node 2 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 5): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 6): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 8): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (4, 9): Node 9 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (5, 1): Node 1 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (5, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (5, 4): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (5, 6): Node 5 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 1): Node 1 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 4): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 5): Node 5 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (6, 8): Node 6 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (7, 0): Node 0 has fewer connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (7, 1): Node 1 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (8, 4): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (8, 6): Node 6 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (9, 2): Node 2 has more connections. No triangles.
- Looking at the edge (9, 4): Node 4 has more connections. No triangles.
