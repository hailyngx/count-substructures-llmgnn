Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 0: A (degree 3)
- Node 1: B (degree 3)
- Node 2: C (degree 4)
- Node 3: D (degree 2)
- Node 4: E (degree 2)
- Node 5: F (degree 3)
- Node 6: G (degree 2)
- Node 7: H (degree 1)
- Node 8: I (degree 1)
- Node 9: J (degree 1)

We will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- (A, B) - shared connections: 0, 1, 3
- (A, C) - shared connections: 0, 2
- (A, D) - no shared connections
- (B, D) - shared connections: 1, 3
- (B, F) - shared connections: 1
- (C, F) - shared connections: 2, 5
- (D, F) - shared connections: 1, 3
- (E, I) - no shared connections

Count of triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 
The unique triangles found are: 
- <A, B, D>
- <A, B, F>
- <A, C, F>
- <B, D, F>
- <C, F, I>
- <D, F, A>
- <F, A, B>
