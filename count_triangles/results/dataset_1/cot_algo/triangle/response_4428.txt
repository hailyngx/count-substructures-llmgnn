Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 3, 9, 0, 6, 7.

After relabeling the vertices, the edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9).

By following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [7].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 4>
<3, 7, 7>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 9, 0>
