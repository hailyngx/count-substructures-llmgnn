Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following labels for the vertices: 

Vertex 8 - degree 2
Vertex 4 - degree 2
Vertex 1 - degree 3
Vertex 7 - degree 3
Vertex 9 - degree 3
Vertex 0 - degree 4
Vertex 5 - degree 4
Vertex 2 - degree 4
Vertex 3 - degree 4
Vertex 6 - degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges as follows:
1. Edge (1, 2) - Proceed (vertex 1 has fewer connections)
2. Edge (1, 3) - Proceed (vertex 1 has fewer connections)
3. Edge (1, 5) - Proceed (vertex 1 has fewer connections)
4. Edge (8, 9) - Proceed (vertex 8 has fewer connections)
5. Edge (4, 6) - Proceed (vertex 4 has fewer connections)
6. Edge (0, 6) - Proceed (vertex 0 has fewer connections)
7. Edge (7, 0) - Proceed (vertex 7 has fewer connections)
8. Edge (2, 1) - Skip (both vertices have the same degree)
9. Edge (2, 3) - Proceed (vertex 2 has fewer connections)
10. Edge (9, 8) - Proceed (vertex 9 has fewer connections)
11. Edge (4, 6) - Skip (already counted)
12. Edge (5, 1) - Skip (already counted)
13. Edge (5, 2) - Skip (already counted)
14. Edge (5, 6) - Proceed (vertex 5 has fewer connections)
15. Edge (6, 0) - Skip (already counted)
16. Edge (6, 4) - Skip (already counted)
17. Edge (6, 5) - Proceed (vertex 6 has fewer connections)
18. Edge (6, 9) - Proceed (vertex 6 has fewer connections)
19. Edge (9, 8) - Skip (already counted)
20. Edge (0, 7) - Proceed (vertex 0 has fewer connections)
21. Edge (7, 3) - Proceed (vertex 7 has fewer connections)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 7>
<6, 4, 5>
<6, 7, 0>
