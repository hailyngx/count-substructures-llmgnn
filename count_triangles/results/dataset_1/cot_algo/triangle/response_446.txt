Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 0
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 5
Node 4: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
- Edge (1, 4): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 4.
- Edge (1, 7): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 7.
- Edge (1, 9): Node 1 does not have fewer connections than Node 9.
- Edge (2, 0): Proceeding since Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 0. Shared connection with Node 0 is Node 4. So, a triangle is formed: <0, 2, 4>.
- Edge (2, 3): Proceeding since Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 3. No shared connections, no triangle.
- Edge (2, 4): Proceeding since Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 4. Shared connections with Node 4 are Node 1 and Node 8. Two triangles are formed: <1, 2, 4> and <2, 4, 8>.
- Edge (2, 8): Proceeding since Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8. Shared connections with Node 8 are Node 4 and Node 7. Two triangles are formed: <2, 4, 8> and <2, 7, 8>.
- Edge (3, 2): Node 3 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
- Edge (4, 1): Node 4 does not have fewer connections than Node 1.
- Edge (4, 2): Node 4 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
- Edge (4, 8): Proceeding since Node 4 has fewer connections than Node 8. Shared connection with Node 8 is Node 2. So, a triangle is formed: <2, 4, 8>.
- Edge (5, 8): Proceeding since Node 5 has fewer connections than Node 8. No shared connections, no triangle.
- Edge (7, 1): Node 7 does not have fewer connections than Node 1.
- Edge (7, 8): Proceeding since Node 7 has fewer connections than Node 8. Shared connection with Node 8 is Node 2. So, a triangle is formed: <2, 7, 8>.
- Edge (8, 2): Node 8 does not have fewer connections than Node 2.
- Edge (8, 4): Node 8 does not have fewer connections than Node 4.
- Edge (8, 5): Node 8 does not have fewer connections than Node 5.
- Edge (8, 7): Node 8 does not have fewer connections than Node 7.
- Edge (9, 1): Node 9 does not have fewer connections than Node 1.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 8>.
