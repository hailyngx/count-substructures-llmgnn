Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degrees:
Nodes in ascending order of degrees: 5, 9, 0, 6, 5, 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
Relabeling the nodes accordingly: 
5 -> 0
9 -> 1
0 -> 2
6 -> 3
5 -> 4
0 -> 5
1 -> 6
4 -> 7
7 -> 8
8 -> 9

Now, let's check for triangles by examining each edge:
(7, 0), (9, 0): No triangle
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (6, 1), (4, 1), (8, 1): <1, 6, 8>
(2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6), (6, 2), (2, 7), (7, 2), (8, 2): <2, 4, 8>
(3, 1), (5, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3): <1, 3, 8>
(3, 7), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 3): <3, 7, 8>
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3): <1, 2, 8> 

Total number of triangles: [5]
