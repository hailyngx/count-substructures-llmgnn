Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Here is the sorted list of vertices with their degrees:

Node 4: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Next, we will analyze the edges in the graph based on the lower labeled node having fewer connections:

Considering the edges in this order: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (9, 0).

1. Edge (0, 2): Check for common neighbors between nodes 0 and 2. Both share node 9 as a neighbor. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
2. Edge (1, 5): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 0): Already counted as <0, 2, 9>.
5. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 6): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (5, 7): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] and the unique triangle is <0, 2, 9>.
