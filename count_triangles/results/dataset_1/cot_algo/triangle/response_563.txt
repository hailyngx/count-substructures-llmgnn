Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:
   - Node 9 is connected to 1 node.
   - Node 4 is connected to 1 node.
   - Nodes 8 and 5 are connected to 2 nodes each.
   - Nodes 7 and 3 are connected to 3 nodes each.
   - Nodes 2 and 4 are connected to 4 nodes each.
   - Nodes 0 and 1 are connected to 4 nodes each.

2. Label the nodes accordingly starting from 0:
   - Node 9 gets label 0.
   - Node 4 gets label 1.
   - Node 8 gets label 2.
   - Node 5 gets label 3.
   - Node 7 gets label 4.
   - Node 3 gets label 5.
   - Node 2 gets label 6.
   - Node 6 gets label 7.
   - Node 1 gets label 8.
   - Node 0 gets label 9.

3. Count the number of triangles using the connections between labeled nodes:
   - Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <5, 6, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 6>.
   
The total number of triangles is [7].
