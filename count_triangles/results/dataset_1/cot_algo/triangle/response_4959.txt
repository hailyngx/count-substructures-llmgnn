Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks like this:

Nodes: 7, 0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2

The edges to consider based on the Degree-Based Ordering method are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 6), (8, 9), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 9), (5, 6)

By checking the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, the total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 6>.
