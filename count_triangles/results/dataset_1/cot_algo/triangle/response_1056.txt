Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following relabeling:

Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 4: 8 connections

Based on the given edges and the relabeling, we observe the following triangles:

- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
