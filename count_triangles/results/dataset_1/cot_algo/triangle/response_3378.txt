Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels for the vertices:
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8 have 3 connections.
Nodes 3, 9 have 4 connections.
Nodes 6, 7 have 5 connections.

Now, we will consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 2): Formed triangles: <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 7): Formed triangles: <1, 7, 0>.
- Edge (2, 1): Skipped, as vertex 1 has more connections.
- Edge (2, 7): Formed triangles: <2, 7, 0>.
- Edge (4, 5): Formed triangles: <4, 5, 0>.
- Edge (6, 4): Formed triangles: <6, 4, 5>.
- Edge (6, 9): Formed triangles: <6, 9, 1>.
- Edge (9, 1): Skipped, as vertex 1 has more connections.
- Edge (9, 8): Formed triangles: <9, 8, 3>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] and the unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <1, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 0>, <4, 5, 0>, <6, 4, 5>, <6, 9, 1>, <9, 8, 3>.
