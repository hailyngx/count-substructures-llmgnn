Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their corresponding degrees in ascending order:

Vertices: 
0 (degree 1)
3 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
1 (degree 3)
3 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)

Now, we examine each edge in the graph based on the degree-based ordering method:

(0, 2) - Proceed
Vertices 0 and 2 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.

(1, 4) - Proceed
Vertices 1 and 4 have a shared connection with vertices 9 and 5, forming triangles <1, 4, 9> and <1, 4, 5>.

(1, 9) - Proceed
Vertices 1 and 9 have a shared connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <1, 9, 4>.

(2, 0) - Skip (Vertex 2 has a higher degree than 0)

(2, 5) - Skip (Vertex 2 has a higher degree than 5)

(2, 7) - Skip (Vertex 2 has a higher degree than 7)

(3, 6) - Proceed
Vertices 3 and 6 have a shared connection, forming a triangle <3, 6, 5>.

(4, 1) - Skip (Vertex 4 has a higher degree than 1)

(4, 9) - Proceed
Vertices 4 and 9 have a shared connection, forming a triangle <4, 9, 5>.

(5, 2) - Skip (Vertex 5 has a higher degree than 2)

(5, 9) - Proceed
Vertices 5 and 9 have a shared connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <5, 9, 4>.

(6, 3) - Proceed
Vertices 6 and 3 have a shared connection, forming a triangle <6, 3, 5>.

(7, 2) - Skip (Vertex 7 has a higher degree than 2)

(9, 1) - Skip (Vertex 9 has a higher degree than 1)

(9, 4) - Skip (Vertex 9 has a higher degree than 4)

(9, 5) - Proceed
Vertices 9 and 5 have a shared connection with vertex 4, forming a triangle <9, 5, 4>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 9>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 5>, and <9, 5, 4>.
