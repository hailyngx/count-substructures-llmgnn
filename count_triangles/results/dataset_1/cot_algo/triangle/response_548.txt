Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling should be: 7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 8, 1, 4, 0, 9.

Now, we look at each edge in order:

1. (0, 2) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 1).
2. (0, 4) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 1).
3. (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
4. (1, 2) can form triangles with 2 shared connections (vertices 0 and 5).
5. (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
6. (1, 4) can form triangles with 2 shared connections (vertices 0 and 9).
7. (1, 6) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 5).
8. (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
9. (2, 0) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 1).
10. (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
11. (2, 5) can form triangles with 2 shared connections (vertices 0 and 8).
12. (2, 8) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 5).
13. (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
14. (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
15. (4, 0) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 1).
16. (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
17. (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
18. (5, 2) can form triangles with 2 shared connections (vertices 1 and 8).
19. (5, 6) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 1).
20. (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
21. (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
22. (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
23. (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
24. (8, 2) can form triangles with 1 shared connection (vertex 5).
25. (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
26. (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
27. (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
28. (9, 4) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 1, 2>, 
<0, 1, 4>, 
<0, 2, 5>, 
<1, 2, 5>, 
<1, 5, 6>, 
<2, 5, 8>.
