Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections

Now, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2) forms the triangle <0, 2, 1>.
- Edge (0, 3) forms the triangle <0, 3, 1>.
- Edge (0, 6) forms the triangle <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms the triangle <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (0, 8) forms the triangle <0, 8, 4>.
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle since vertex 1 has more connections.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle since vertex 1 has more connections.
- Edge (1, 9) forms the triangle <1, 9, 6>.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle since vertex 2 has more connections.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle since vertex 4 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle since vertex 6 has more connections.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle since vertex 7 has more connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 3, 1>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, and <0, 8, 4>.
