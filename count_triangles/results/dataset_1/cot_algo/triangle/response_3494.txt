Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted order is: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 0, 7, 1, 6, 4.

Next, we will relabel the vertices as follows:
2 -> 0
3 -> 1
5 -> 2
8 -> 3
9 -> 4
0 -> 5
7 -> 6
1 -> 7
6 -> 8
4 -> 9

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
