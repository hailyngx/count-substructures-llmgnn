Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
Node 1: 2 connections (1, 5)
Node 4: 2 connections (4, 5)
Node 0: 2 connections (0, 8)
Node 9: 3 connections (0, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)
Node 3: 4 connections (1, 3), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)
Node 5: 4 connections (1, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4)
Node 7: 4 connections (2, 7), (3, 7), (6, 7), (7, 9)
Node 6: 5 connections (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Node 2: 5 connections (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (7, 2)
Node 8: 8 connections (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9)
