Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree and relabeling them accordingly, the graph becomes:

Vertices: 0 (degree 2), 1 (degree 2), 5 (degree 1), 7 (degree 2), 8 (degree 3), 6 (degree 3), 3 (degree 4), 9 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5)

The edges to consider using the Degree-Based Ordering method are: (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (5, 3), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 3)

Now, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>
