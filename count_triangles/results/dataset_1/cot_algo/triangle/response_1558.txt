Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Node 5: 0 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Nodes 0, 4: 2 connections
- Nodes 1, 9: 3 connections
- Nodes 7, 2: 4 connections
- Nodes 3, 8: 5 connections
- Node 6: 6 connections

We will relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 5 (0 connections): A
- Node 2 (1 connection): B
- Nodes 0, 4 (2 connections): C, D
- Nodes 1, 9 (3 connections): E, F
- Nodes 7, 2 (4 connections): G, B
- Nodes 3, 8 (5 connections): H, I
- Node 6 (6 connections): J

Now, we will list the triangles based on the connections:

- Triangle <A, B, G>
- Triangle <B, C, D>
- Triangle <B, G, I>
- Triangle <B, I, H>
- Triangle <B, G, J>
- Triangle <B, G, H>
- Triangle <C, D, E>
- Triangle <E, F, I>
- Triangle <E, F, G>
- Triangle <E, F, H>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] triangles in the given graph.
