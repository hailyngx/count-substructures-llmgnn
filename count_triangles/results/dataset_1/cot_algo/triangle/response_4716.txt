Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

```
0 -- 2 -- 3 -- 6 -- 7
|         |         |
4         8 -- 9     5
|         |
1         |
          |
```

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
3: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will list the edges based on the above sorting and only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, we find that there are 7 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 3>
<8, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
