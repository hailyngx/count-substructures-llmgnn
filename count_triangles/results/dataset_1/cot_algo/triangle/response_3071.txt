Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes with their connections:
0: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
9: 1 connection

Now, relabel the nodes:
0 -> 0
4 -> 1
7 -> 2
6 -> 3
9 -> 4

Now, we will go through the edges following the process mentioned earlier:

(0, 4): Both 0 and 4 have 3 connections, so we proceed. They share 7 as a connection. 
(0, 6): 0 has more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
(0, 7): 0 has more connections than 2, so we skip this edge.
(4, 0): Already counted.
(4, 7): 1 has fewer connections than 2, and they share 0 as a connection. 
(4, 9): 1 has fewer connections than 4, and they share no connection.

Now, we count the triangles:
- Triangle (0, 4, 7) is found.

Finally, we output the result:
[1] 
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 7>
