Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new order is: 7, 0, 1, 8, 9, 5, 4, 3, 6, 2.

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Examining the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:  
1. Edge (7, 6): Shared connections = [0]
2. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections = [6]
3. Edge (1, 5): Shared connections = []
4. Edge (8, 7): Shared connections = []
5. Edge (9, 4): Shared connections = []

Therefore, there are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph.  
The unique triangles found are <0, 6, 2>.
