Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 1: 1 edge
Node 7: 1 edge
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 5 edges
Node 0: 7 edges

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with the edge (0, 2) since node 0 has fewer connections than node 2. Looking at shared connections, we find that node 0 and 2 share edges with nodes 4 and 5. This gives us two triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 2, 5>.

Moving on to the next suitable edge, we have (0, 4). Node 0 and 4 share connections with nodes 2 and 5, forming the triangle <0, 4, 2>.

Continuing this process for the remaining suitable edges, we find:
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 2>.
- Edge (0, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
