Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each vertex has:

- Vertex 0: 1 connection
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 4 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 1 connection
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 5 connections
- Vertex 9: 2 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 0: 1 connection -> Vertex 0
- Vertex 1: 1 connection -> Vertex 1
- Vertex 3: 2 connections -> Vertex 2
- Vertex 4: 1 connection -> Vertex 3
- Vertex 5: 2 connections -> Vertex 4
- Vertex 9: 2 connections -> Vertex 5
- Vertex 2: 4 connections -> Vertex 6
- Vertex 7: 5 connections -> Vertex 7
- Vertex 6: 5 connections -> Vertex 8

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (1, 7): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have fewer connections, forming a triangle with vertex 7. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (2, 5): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 6 has more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (3, 2): Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (3, 7): Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (4, 6): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (5, 2): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (6, 2): Vertex 6 has more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (6, 4): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (6, 7): Vertex 7 has more connections, forming a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 has more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (7, 0): Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 1): Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 3): Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (7, 6): Vertex 7 has more connections, forming a triangle with vertex 3. Triangle: <2, 3, 7>
- Edge (9, 5): Both vertices have more connections, so we skip.
- Edge (9, 6): Vertex 6 has more connections, so we skip.
