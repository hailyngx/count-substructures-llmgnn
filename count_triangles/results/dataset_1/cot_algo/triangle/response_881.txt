Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 4 (Degree 0)
Node 6 (Degree 0)
Node 4 (Degree 1)
Node 7 (Degree 1)
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 4)
Node 8 (Degree 4)
Node 9 (Degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <2, 5, 9>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>

Thus, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
