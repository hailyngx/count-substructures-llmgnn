Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 0
Node 7: Degree 0
Node 0: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will analyze the edges in the following order:

(5, 9) - No triangles
(8, 2) - No triangles

Now, for each remaining edge:
(1, 4) - Forms a triangle <1, 4, 0>

(0, 3) - Forms a triangle <0, 3, 2>
(0, 4) - Forms a triangle <0, 4, 1>
(0, 9) - Forms a triangle <0, 9, 1>

(2, 3) - No triangles

(3, 0) - No triangles
(3, 2) - No triangles

(4, 0) - No triangles
(4, 1) - No triangles

(9, 0) - No triangles
(9, 1) - No triangles
(9, 5) - No triangles

In total, there are 3 triangles in the given graph, which are <1, 4, 0>, <0, 3, 2>, and <0, 9, 1>.
The total number of triangles is [3].
