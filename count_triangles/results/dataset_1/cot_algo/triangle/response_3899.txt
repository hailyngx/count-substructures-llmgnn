Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted vertices are: <3, 1, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0>.

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph considering the lower labeled vertex to have fewer connections:

1. Edge (3, 8): Vertex 3 and Vertex 8 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

2. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 and Vertex 7 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

3. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 and Vertex 9 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

4. Edge (2, 0): Vertex 2 and Vertex 0 share one common neighbor (Vertex 4). A triangle <0, 2, 4> is formed.

5. Edge (4, 6): Vertex 4 and Vertex 6 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

6. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 and Vertex 9 share two common neighbors (Vertex 4 and Vertex 0). Triangles <0, 6, 4> and <0, 6, 9> are formed.

7. Edge (7, 0): Vertex 7 and Vertex 0 share three common neighbors (Vertex 1, Vertex 2, Vertex 9). Triangles <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9> are formed.

8. Edge (8, 3): Vertex 8 and Vertex 3 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

9. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 and Vertex 5 do not share any common neighbors. No triangles are formed.

10. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 and Vertex 9 share three common neighbors (Vertex 2, Vertex 4, Vertex 7). Triangles <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 9> are formed.

11. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 and Vertex 6 share two common neighbors (Vertex 0 and Vertex 4). Triangles <0, 6, 9> and <4, 6, 9> are formed.

12. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 9 and Vertex 8 share one common neighbor (Vertex 0). A triangle <0, 8, 9> is formed.

The total number of triangles inside brackets is [8].
