Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 7, 2, 0, 6, 9

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
