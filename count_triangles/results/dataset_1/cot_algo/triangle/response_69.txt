Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 8), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 1)

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Nodes sorted by degree:
1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→0

Now, let's count the total number of triangles:

[10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
