Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 5 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 5 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 7 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 6 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 4 connections

Now, using the degree-based ordering method, we will relabel the vertices from lowest to highest degree:

1 -> 0, 8 -> 1, 3 -> 2, 5 -> 3, 9 -> 4, 7 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 0 -> 9

Next, we will look at each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles:
1. <5, 7, 9>
2. <5, 4, 7>
3. <3, 7, 5>
4. <2, 7, 6>
5. <0, 6, 9>
6. <0, 4, 9>
7. <0, 6, 7>
8. <0, 4, 7>
9. <0, 4, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
