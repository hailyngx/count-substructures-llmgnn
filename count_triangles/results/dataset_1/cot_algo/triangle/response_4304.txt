Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, so we relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 0 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.

Now, we proceed by checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 7): Both vertices with labels 0 and 7 have 1 connection. No triangle forms.
2. Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, vertex 2 has 6 connections. No triangle forms.
3. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 has 2 connections, vertex 9 has 5 connections. No triangle forms.
4. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 has 6 connections, vertex 3 has 4 connections. Triangle <2, 3, 6> forms.
5. Continuing in this manner, we find the following triangles:
   <2, 3, 6>
   <2, 3, 9>
   <2, 6, 7>
   <3, 4, 6>
   <4, 5, 8>
   <4, 5, 9>
   <4, 6, 9>
   <5, 6, 7>
   <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
