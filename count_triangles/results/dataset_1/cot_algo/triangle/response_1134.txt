Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 share Node 5 as a connection. Triangle <0, 1, 5>.
- Edge (0, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (1, 0): Already counted in the (0, 1) edge.
- Edge (1, 6): Node 1 and Node 6 share Node 4 as a connection. Triangle <1, 4, 6>.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 0): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (5, 0): Already counted in the (0, 5) edge.
- Edge (5, 6): Node 5 and Node 6 share Node 1 as a connection. Triangle <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 1): Already counted in the (1, 6) edge.
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (6, 5): Already counted in the (5, 6) edge.
- Edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 share Node 4 as a connection. Triangle <4, 6, 9>.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
- Edge (8, 1): Already counted in the (1, 8) edge.
- Edge (8, 2): Already counted in the (2, 8) edge.
- Edge (9, 4): Already counted in the (4, 9) edge.
- Edge (9, 6): Already counted in the (6, 9) edge.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 9>.
