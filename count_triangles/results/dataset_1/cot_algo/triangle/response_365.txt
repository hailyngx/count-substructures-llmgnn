Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 edges.
- Node 3 has 2 edges.
- Node 5 has 1 edge.
- Node 6 has 1 edge.
- Node 9 has 2 edges.
- Node 2 has 3 edges.
- Node 4 has 3 edges.
- Node 8 has 3 edges.
- Node 1 has 5 edges.
- Node 7 has 5 edges.

Relabeled vertices:
- Node 0 -> Node A
- Node 3 -> Node B
- Node 5 -> Node C
- Node 6 -> Node D
- Node 9 -> Node E
- Node 2 -> Node F
- Node 4 -> Node G
- Node 8 -> Node H
- Node 1 -> Node I
- Node 7 -> Node J

Counting triangles:
1. (A, I, J) <- Triangle 1
2. (B, J, I) <- Triangle 2
3. (F, I, J) <- Triangle 3
4. (G, J, I) <- Triangle 4
5. (H, I, J) <- Triangle 5

Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 8, 7>
