Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 3: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges to count the number of triangles:
1. (1, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 -> <1, 2, 3>
2. (2, 3): Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 5 -> <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 5>
3. (2, 4): No triangle since vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
4. (2, 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 -> <2, 3, 5>
5. (2, 6): No triangle since vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2.
6. (3, 0): Forms a triangle with vertex 8 -> <0, 3, 8>
7. (3, 1): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 5 -> <1, 2, 3>, <2, 3, 5>
8. (3, 5): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 6 -> <2, 3, 5>, <2, 3, 6>
9. (3, 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 -> <0, 3, 8>
10. (4, 8): No triangle since vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.
11. (4, 9): No triangle since vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 4.
12. (5, 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 3 -> <2, 3, 5>
13. (6, 2): No triangle since vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6.
14. (7, 8): No triangle since vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 7.
15. (7, 9): No triangle since vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 7.
16. (8, 3): Forms a triangle with vertex 0 -> <0, 3, 8>
17. (8, 4): No triangle since vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is 8, and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
