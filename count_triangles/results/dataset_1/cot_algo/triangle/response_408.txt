Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 8: 4 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 5: 5 connections
- Node 0: 5 connections
- Node 7: 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles by examining edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

1. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (9, 3): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (4, 1): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (3, 5): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (5, 1): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (8, 0): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (0, 1): Triangle formed with shared connection 5: <0, 1, 5>.
9. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (7, 0): Triangle formed with shared connections 8 and 5: <0, 7, 8>.
12. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (7, 4): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (7, 5): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 7, 8>
