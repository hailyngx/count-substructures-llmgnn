Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 5: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 5: 1 connection each
Nodes 1, 2, 4, 8: 2 connections each
Nodes 3, 9: 4 connections each
Nodes 6, 7: 5 connections each

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: Triangle <0, 7, 2>
2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 9: No triangle
3. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 3: Triangle <1, 3, 4>
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 4: Triangle <1, 4, 3>
5. Edge (1, 8): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 8: No triangle
6. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: Triangle <2, 7, 0>
7. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 8: No triangle
8. Edge (3, 1): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 3: Triangle <1, 3, 4>
9. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 4: Triangle <3, 4, 1>
10. Edge (3, 6): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 6: No triangle
11. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 9: Triangle <3, 9, 0>
12. Edge (4, 1): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 4: Triangle <1, 4, 3>
13. Edge (4, 3): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 4: Triangle <3, 4, 1>
14. Edge (6, 3): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 6: No triangle
15. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: No triangle
16. Edge (7, 0): Node 0 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: Triangle <0, 7, 2>
17. Edge (7, 2): Node 2 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: Triangle <2, 7, 0>
18. Edge (7, 6): Node 6 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 7: No triangle
19. Edge (8, 1): Node 1 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 8: No triangle
20. Edge (8, 2): Node 2 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 8: No triangle
21. Edge (9, 0): Node 0 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 9: No triangle
22. Edge (9, 3): Node 3 is lower-degree, check shared connections with 9: Triangle <3, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 9, 0>, <1, 4, 3>.
