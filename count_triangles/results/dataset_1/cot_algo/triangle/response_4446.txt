Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices by degree: 9, 1, 5, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8, 0, 2

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 2, proceed.
    Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 4, 7, 8.
    Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 5, 9.

    Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 2, 7, 8.
    Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 6, 8.
    The shared connection between vertices 0 and 4 is vertex 8, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.

3. Edge (0, 7): Vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7, proceed.
    Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 2, 4, 8.
