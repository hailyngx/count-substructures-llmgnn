Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

Vertex 1: 0 connections
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 6: 0 connections
Vertex 8: 0 connections
Vertex 10: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections

The triangles in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
