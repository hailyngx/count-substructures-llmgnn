Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections as follows:

0 (3 connections), 1 (2 connections), 3 (2 connections), 4 (1 connection), 5 (2 connections), 6 (1 connection), 7 (5 connections), 8 (4 connections), 9 (6 connections)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 4): No triangles formed.
2. Edge (0, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 8>
3. Edge (0, 7): Triangle formed: <0, 7, 1>
4. Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 9, 3>
6. Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (4, 0): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (5, 0): Triangle formed: <5, 0, 7>
9. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (7, 0): Triangle formed: <7, 0, 5>
12. Edge (7, 1): Triangle formed: <7, 1, 9>
13. Edge (7, 8): Triangle formed: <7, 8, 5>
14. Edge (7, 9): Triangle formed: <7, 9, 1>
15. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
16. Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (8, 9): Triangle formed: <8, 9, 7>
18. Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (9, 3): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.
21. Edge (9, 7): No triangles formed.
22. Edge (9, 8): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 1>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 8, 5>
