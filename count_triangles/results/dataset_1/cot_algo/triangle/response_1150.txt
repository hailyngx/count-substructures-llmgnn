Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their degrees, we have the following labels:
Node 5: degree 1
Nodes 1, 4, 8: degree 2
Nodes 3, 6, 9: degree 3
Nodes 0, 2, 7: degree 5

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
- Checking node 1 (degree 2):
  - (1, 0) -> Shared connections with node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9) -> 4 triangles

- Checking node 4 (degree 2):
  - (4, 1) -> Shared connections with node 1: (0, 1) -> 1 triangle
  - (4, 6) -> Shared connections with node 6: (3, 6) -> 1 triangle
  - (4, 7) -> Shared connections with node 7: (0, 7), (3, 7) -> 2 triangles

- Checking node 8 (degree 2):
  - No triangles since there are no edges where 8 has fewer connections.

- Checking node 3 (degree 3):
  - (3, 0) -> Shared connections with node 0: (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9) -> 3 triangles

- Checking node 6 (degree 3):
  - No triangles since there are no edges where 6 has fewer connections.

- Checking node 9 (degree 3):
  - (9, 0) -> Shared connections with node 0: (0, 2), (0, 9) -> 1 triangle
  - (9, 2) -> Shared connections with node 2: (0, 2), (2, 8) -> 2 triangles

- Checking node 0 (degree 5):
  - (0, 1) -> Shared connections with node 1: (0, 1) -> 1 triangle
  - (0, 2) -> Shared connections with node 2: (0, 2), (2, 9) -> 2 triangles
  - (0, 3) -> Shared connections with node 3: (0, 3), (3, 6), (3, 7) -> 3 triangles
  - (0, 7) -> Shared connections with node 7: (0, 7) -> 1 triangle
  - (0, 9) -> Shared connections with node 9: (0, 9) -> 1 triangle

Counting the total number of triangles based on the shared connections:
[14]
