Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 8 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 3 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 2: 0 connections -> Label 0
- Node 1: 1 connection -> Label 1
- Node 5: 2 connections -> Label 2
- Node 3: 3 connections -> Label 3
- Node 7: 3 connections -> Label 3
- Node 9: 3 connections -> Label 3
- Node 4: 4 connections -> Label 4
- Node 0: 8 connections -> Label 5
- Node 6: 5 connections -> Label 6
- Node 8: 5 connections -> Label 6

Now, let's list the edges in order based on the labels:
(2, 8) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (4, 8) (4, 6) (9, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <2, 8, 9>
- Triangle 2: <3, 6, 4>
- Triangle 3: <3, 6, 0>
- Triangle 4: <7, 6, 0>
- Triangle 5: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <0, 6, 4>
- Triangle 7: <0, 6, 3>
- Triangle 8: <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle 9: <0, 6, 8>
- Triangle 10: <0, 4, 8>

There are 10 triangles in total, which can be shown as [10].
