Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling for the vertices is as follows: 
Node 0: 2 connections 
Node 1: 3 connections 
Node 2: 3 connections 
Node 3: 3 connections 
Node 4: 3 connections 
Node 5: 1 connection 
Node 6: 5 connections 
Node 7: 3 connections 
Node 8: 6 connections 
Node 9: 4 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles based on shared connections:

<6, 0, 8>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 1, 4>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 2, 8>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 8, 7>
<8, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
