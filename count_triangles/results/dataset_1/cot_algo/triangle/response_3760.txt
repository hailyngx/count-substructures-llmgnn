Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their respective degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3

Now, we will sort the vertices by their degrees:
- Node 6 (degree 1)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 5)

Next, we will go through each edge in this sorted order to count the triangles formed:
- Edge (6, 2): No triangle
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle
- Edge (5, 1): No triangle
- Edge (0, 1): Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle
- Edge (8, 7): No triangle

Total number of triangles inside brackets []: [2]
