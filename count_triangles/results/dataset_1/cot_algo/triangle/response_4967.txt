Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices will be: 

0 -> 7  
1 -> 3  
2 -> 2  
3 -> 6  
4 -> 8  
5 -> 4  
6 -> 9  
7 -> 5  
8 -> 1  
9 -> 0  

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles: 
1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 7: <0, 1, 7>  
2. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections with 7: <0, 5, 7>  
3. Edge (1, 4): No triangles as 3 has more connections than 4  
4. Edge (2, 4): No triangles as 4 has more connections than 2  
5. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with 4: <2, 4, 8>  
6. Edge (3, 4): Shared connections with 6: <3, 4, 6>  
7. Edge (3, 5): Shared connections with 6: <3, 5, 6>   
8. Edge (3, 7): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 3   
9. Edge (3, 9): Shared connections with 6: <3, 6, 9>  
10. Edge (4, 1): No triangles as 3 has more connections than 4  
11. Edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 4: <4, 8, 2>  
12. Edge (5, 0): Shared connections with 7: <5, 0, 7>  
13. Edge (5, 3): Shared connections with 6: <5, 3, 6>  
14. Edge (5, 7): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 5  
15. Edge (6, 7): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 6  
16. Edge (7, 3): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 3   
17. Edge (7, 5): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 5  
18. Edge (7, 6): No triangles as 7 has more connections than 6  
19. Edge (8, 2): Shared connections with 4: <8, 2, 4>  
20. Edge (8, 4): Shared connections with 4: <8, 4, 2>  
21. Edge (8, 9): Shared connections with 8: <8, 9, 3>  
22. Edge (9, 3): Shared connections with 6: <9, 3, 6>  
23. Edge (9, 8): Shared connections with 8: <9, 8, 4>  

Total number of triangles: [9]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 8, 2>, <8, 9, 3>, <9, 3, 6>
