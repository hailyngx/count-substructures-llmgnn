Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degree from least to most:
   Nodes with their degree: (1, 1), (7, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (6, 4), (9, 4), (5, 5)

2. Relabel the vertices based on their degree (0-indexed):
   New labels: {1: 0, 7: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 7: 4, 8: 5, 0: 6, 1: 7, 2: 8, 6: 9, 9: 10, 5: 11}

3. Count the triangles:
   - For the edge (0, 2): Check shared connections for 0 (6) and 2 (8) -> Shared connection: 9
   - For the edge (0, 6): Check shared connections for 0 (6) and 6 (9) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (0, 9): Check shared connections for 0 (6) and 9 (10) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (1, 6): Check shared connections for 1 (7) and 6 (9) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (2, 0): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (2 has 3 connections)
   - For the edge (2, 8): Check shared connections for 2 (8) and 8 (5) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (3, 5): Check shared connections for 3 (2) and 5 (11) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (3, 6): Check shared connections for 3 (2) and 6 (9) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (4, 5): Check shared connections for 4 (3) and 5 (11) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (4, 9): Check shared connections for 4 (3) and 9 (10) -> Shared connection: 5
   - For the edge (5, 3): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (3 has 2 connections)
   - For the edge (5, 4): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (4 has 2 connections)
   - For the edge (5, 9): Check shared connections for 5 (11) and 9 (10) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (6, 0): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (6 has 4 connections)
   - For the edge (6, 1): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (1 has 1 connection)
   - For the edge (6, 3): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (3 has 2 connections)
   - For the edge (6, 7): Check shared connections for 6 (9) and 7 (1) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (7, 6): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (6 has 4 connections)
   - For the edge (8, 2): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (2 has 3 connections)
   - For the edge (8, 9): Check shared connections for 8 (5) and 9 (10) -> Shared connection: None
   - For the edge (9, 0): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (9 has 4 connections)
   - For the edge (9, 4): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (4 has 2 connections)
   - For the edge (9, 5): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (5 has 5 connections)
   - For the edge (9, 8): Proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections (8 has 2 connections)

The total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 9>.
