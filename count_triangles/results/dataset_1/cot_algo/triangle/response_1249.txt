Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. 
Here are the vertices labeled with the number of connections they have in ascending order:
- Node 7: 0 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 8: 0 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections

We will now go through each edge in the sorted order and count the triangles:

Considering edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
1. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
2. Edge (5, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 5, 9>.
3. Edge (6, 2): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 9>.
4. Edge (3, 2): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 2): Triangle formed: <1, 2, 9>.
6. Edge (0, 1): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>.
7. Edge (0, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 4, 9>.
8. Edge (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 9, 2>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Triangles: <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 9>
