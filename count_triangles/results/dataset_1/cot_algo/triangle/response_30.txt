Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections, from least to most:
Vertices by degree: 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly: 
0 --> 0
2 --> 1
1 --> 2
5 --> 3
4 --> 4
8 --> 5
3 --> 6
7 --> 7
6 --> 8
9 --> 9

Now, we will look at each edge to count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 2 connections (degree 2), and vertex 1 has 4 connections (degree 7). Proceed.
    Shared connections between 0 and 1: 1
    Triangles with edge (0, 2): <0, 2, 1>

Total number of triangles: [1]
