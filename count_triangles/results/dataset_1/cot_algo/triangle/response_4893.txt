Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new vertex ordering is: 0, 3, 8, 9, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2, 1.

Now, we will analyze the edges based on the new vertex ordering:

1. (0, 2): Shared connections with vertex 0: 5, 6. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
2. (0, 5): Shared connections with vertex 0: 2, 6. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 2>.
3. (0, 6): Shared connections with vertex 0: 2, 5. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 2>.
4. (1, 7): No triangle formed.
5. (1, 8): No triangle formed.
6. (1, 9): No triangle formed.
7. (2, 0): Shared connections with vertex 0: 5, 6. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>.
8. (2, 4): Shared connections with vertex 2: 5. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
9. (2, 5): Shared connections with vertex 2: 0, 4. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>; <2, 4, 5>.
10. (3, 6): No triangle formed.
11. (3, 7): No triangle formed.
12. (4, 2): Shared connections with vertex 2: 5. Triangle formed: <2, 4, 5>.
13. (4, 5): Shared connections with vertex 2: 0, 2. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>; <2, 4, 5>.
14. (4, 7): No triangle formed.
15. (5, 0): Shared connections with vertex 0: 2, 6. Triangle formed: <0, 5, 2>.
16. (5, 2): Shared connections with vertex 2: 0, 4. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>; <2, 4, 5>.
17. (5, 4): Shared connections with vertex 2: 0, 2. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 5>; <2, 4, 5>.
18. (6, 0): Shared connections with vertex 0: 2, 5. Triangle formed: <0, 6, 2>.
19. (6, 3): No triangle formed.
20. (7, 1): No triangle formed.
21. (7, 3): No triangle formed.
22. (7, 4): No triangle formed.
23. (8, 1): No triangle formed.
24. (9, 1): No triangle formed.

After analyzing all edges, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 2>, <0, 6, 2>, <2, 4, 5>.
