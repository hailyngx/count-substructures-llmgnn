Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 3 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes according to their degree-based ordering as follows:
- Node 1 -> Node A
- Node 4 -> Node B
- Node 6 -> Node C
- Node 7 -> Node D
- Node 8 -> Node E
- Node 9 -> Node F

Next, we will examine each edge to count the triangles:

- Edge (A, B): Node A has 1 connection and Node B has 4 connections => Proceed
    - Node A and Node B share 0 common connections

- Edge (B, E): Node B has 4 connections and Node E has 5 connections => Proceed
    - Node B and Node E share connections with Node 4 and Node 8
    - This forms a triangle: <4, 8, 9>

- Edge (B, F): Node B has 4 connections and Node F has 3 connections => Proceed
    - Node B and Node F share connections with Node 4 and Node 9
    - This forms a triangle: <4, 8, 9>

- Edge (C, D): Node C has 2 connections and Node D has 2 connections => Proceed
    - Node C and Node D share 1 common connection with Node 6
    - This forms a triangle: <6, 7, 8>

- Edge (E, F): Node E has 5 connections and Node F has 3 connections => Proceed
    - Node E and Node F share connections with Node 8 and Node 9
    - This forms a triangle: <4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
