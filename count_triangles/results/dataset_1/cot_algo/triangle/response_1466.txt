Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:

0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
9: 1 connection
8: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
2: 4 connections

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

0 (degree 2) -> 0
9 (degree 1) -> 1
3 (degree 2) -> 2
6 (degree 2) -> 3
8 (degree 3) -> 4
5 (degree 3) -> 5
1 (degree 3) -> 6
4 (degree 4) -> 7
2 (degree 4) -> 8

Now we will examine each edge and count the triangles:

(0, 2):
Shared connections with 0: 1, 9
Shared connections with 2: 1, 3, 8
Triangle: <0, 2, 1>

(0, 9):
Shared connections with 0: 2
Shared connections with 9: 0
Triangle: <0, 9, 2>

(1, 2):
No triangle formed.

(1, 4):
Shared connections with 1: 2, 5
Shared connections with 4: 2, 3, 5, 6
Triangles: <1, 4, 2>

(1, 5):
Shared connections with 1: 4
Shared connections with 5: 4, 8
Triangle: <1, 5, 4>

(2, 3):
Shared connections with 2: 0, 1, 8
Shared connections with 3: 1, 4
Triangle: <2, 3, 1>

(2, 8):
Shared connections with 2: 0, 3
Shared connections with 8: 5, 6
Triangle: <2, 8, 6>

(3, 4):
Shared connections with 3: 2
Shared connections with 4: 1, 5, 6
Triangle: <3, 4, 1>

(4, 5):
No triangle formed.

(4, 6):
Shared connections with 4: 1, 3, 8
Shared connections with 6: 8
Triangle: <4, 6, 8>

(5, 8):
Shared connections with 5: 1, 4
Shared connections with 8: 2, 6
Triangle: <5, 8, 4>

(8, 6):
No triangle formed.

Now let's count the total number of triangles: [8]

The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 1>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 4, 2>, <1, 5, 4>, <2, 3, 1>, <2, 8, 6>, <3, 4, 1>, <4, 6, 8>.
