Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a Degree-Based Ordering for the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertices by their connections (in ascending order):
0: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 6 connections
2: 8 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Edge (0, 2):
Both 0 and 2 are connected to 5, so there is a triangle <0, 2, 5>.

Edge (0, 5):
0 and 5 share a connection with 2, so there is a triangle <0, 5, 2>.

Edge (1, 2):
1 and 2 both share a connection with 5, forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

Edge (1, 4):
1 and 4 have connections with 5, creating a triangle <1, 4, 5>.

Edge (1, 6):
1 and 6 do not have shared connections.

Edge (2, 0):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (2, 1):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (3, 5):
3 and 5 share a connection with 0, forming a triangle <3, 5, 0>.

Edge (3, 8):
3 and 8 do not have shared connections.

Edge (4, 1):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (4, 5):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (4, 8):
4 and 8 both share a connection with 3, creating a triangle <4, 8, 3>.

Edge (4, 9):
4 and 9 do not have shared connections.

Edge (5, 0):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (5, 3):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (5, 4):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (5, 6):
5 and 6 share a connection with 1, forming a triangle <5, 6, 1>.

Edge (5, 7):
5 and 7 do not have shared connections.

Edge (6, 1):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (6, 5):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (7, 5):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (8, 3):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (8, 4):
This edge was already considered.

Edge (9, 4):
This edge was already considered.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 8, 3>, <5, 6, 1>
