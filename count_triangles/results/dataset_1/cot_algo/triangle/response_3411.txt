Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following list: 

Nodes ordered by degree: [4, 8, 9, 2, 3, 1, 7, 6, 5, 0]

Now, we will count the triangles:

Triangles: [7]

Unique triangles: <0, 5, 6>
