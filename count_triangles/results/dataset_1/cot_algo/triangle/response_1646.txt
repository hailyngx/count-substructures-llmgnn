Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0: 4 connections
- Vertex 1: 2 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 4: 3 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 6: 2 connections
- Vertex 7: 1 connection
- Vertex 8: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections

Sorted vertices based on degree (from least to most connections):
5, 7, 1, 6, 8, 4, 9, 0, 3, 2

Edges to consider based on the degree order:
(5, 2) - Vertex 5 has 1 connection, Vertex 2 has 5 connections
(7, 0) - Vertex 7 has 1 connection, Vertex 0 has 4 connections
(1, 6) - Vertex 1 has 2 connections, Vertex 6 has 2 connections
(6, 2) - Vertex 6 has 2 connections, Vertex 2 has 5 connections
(8, 0) - Vertex 8 has 2 connections, Vertex 0 has 4 connections
(4, 0) - Vertex 4 has 3 connections, Vertex 0 has 4 connections
(4, 2) - Vertex 4 has 3 connections, Vertex 2 has 5 connections
(9, 1) - Vertex 9 has 3 connections, Vertex 1 has 2 connections
(9, 2) - Vertex 9 has 3 connections, Vertex 2 has 5 connections
(9, 4) - Vertex 9 has 3 connections, Vertex 4 has 3 connections
