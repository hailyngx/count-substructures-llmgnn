Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree of connections, the new labeling will be as follows:
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 8 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 7 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 5 connections.
- Node 1 has 6 connections.
- Node 0 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles based on the edges provided in the graph. 

Number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <1, 5, 7>
