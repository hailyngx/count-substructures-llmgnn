Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following labels for the vertices based on their degree (starting from 0):

Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 2 has degree 2
Vertex 3 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 9 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 4
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 7 has degree 4
Vertex 4 has degree 8

Let's analyze the edges based on the lowest label vertex having the fewest connections:

1. Edge between vertex 0 and vertex 7: Forms triangles with vertices 4 and 9. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)
2. Edge between vertex 1 and vertex 6: No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge between vertex 2 and vertex 4: No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge between vertex 3 and vertex 4: Forms a triangle with vertex 5. (Triangle: <3, 4, 5>)
5. Edge between vertex 3 and vertex 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <3, 4, 5>)
6. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 2: No triangles can be formed.
7. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 3: No triangles can be formed.
8. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 3. (Triangle: <3, 4, 5>)
9. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 6: Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 9. (Triangle: <1, 4, 9>)
10. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 7: Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 9. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)
11. Edge between vertex 4 and vertex 8: Forms a triangle with vertex 5. (Triangle: <4, 5, 8>)
12. Edge between vertex 5 and vertex 3: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <3, 4, 5>)
13. Edge between vertex 5 and vertex 4: Forms triangles with vertices 3 and 8. (Triangle: <3, 4, 5>), (Triangle: <4, 5, 8>)
14. Edge between vertex 5 and vertex 8: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <4, 5, 8>)
15. Edge between vertex 5 and vertex 9: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <4, 5, 9>)
16. Edge between vertex 6 and vertex 1: No triangles can be formed.
17. Edge between vertex 6 and vertex 4: Forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 9. (Triangle: <1, 4, 9>)
18. Edge between vertex 6 and vertex 9: Forms triangles with vertices 1 and 4. (Triangle: <1, 4, 9>)
19. Edge between vertex 7 and vertex 0: Forms triangles with vertices 4 and 9. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)
20. Edge between vertex 7 and vertex 4: Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 9. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)
21. Edge between vertex 7 and vertex 9: Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 4. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)
22. Edge between vertex 8 and vertex 4: Forms a triangle with vertex 5. (Triangle: <4, 5, 8>)
23. Edge between vertex 8 and vertex 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <4, 5, 8>)
24. Edge between vertex 9 and vertex 5: Forms a triangle with vertex 4. (Triangle: <4, 5, 9>)
25. Edge between vertex 9 and vertex 6: Forms triangles with vertices 1 and 4. (Triangle: <1, 4, 9>)
26. Edge between vertex 9 and vertex 7: Forms triangles with vertices 0 and 4. (Triangle: <0, 4, 9>)

The total number of triangles is [9].
