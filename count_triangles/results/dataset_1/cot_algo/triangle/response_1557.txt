Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 7, 0, 5, 6, 1, 5, 9, 4, 2, 8.

Identifying triangles based on the given edges:
- For edge (0, 2): No triangles.
- For edge (1, 5): No triangles.
- For edge (1, 6): No triangles.
- For edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 0, 3>.
- For edge (3, 4): No triangles.
- For edge (3, 8): No triangles.
- For edge (3, 9): Triangle <3, 4, 9>.
- For edge (4, 9): No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <2, 0, 3>, <3, 4, 9>.
