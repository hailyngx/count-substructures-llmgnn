Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 7 has 1 connection.
Vertices 0, 1, 5 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 3, 5, 7 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 2, 8, 9 have 4 connections each.
Vertices 4 and 6 have 5 connections each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- We will start with the edge (0, 4) because 0 has fewer connections than 4. This edge forms a triangle with vertex 2, so we have found one triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- Next, we consider the edge (0, 6) which forms a triangle with vertices 1 and 2, giving us another triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Moving on to the edge (1, 2), we find a triangle with vertices 0 and 6, giving us another triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- The edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 6, resulting in the triangle <0, 2, 4>.
- The edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5.
- The edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with vertices 0 and 1, giving us the triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- The edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 8.
- The edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9.
- The edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 7.
- The edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 4>.
