Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 2 with degree 2 is relabeled as Node 0
- Node 7 with degree 2 is relabeled as Node 1
- Node 9 with degree 2 is relabeled as Node 2
- Node 8 with degree 3 is relabeled as Node 3
- Node 0 with degree 4 is relabeled as Node 4
- Node 5 with degree 4 is relabeled as Node 5
- Node 6 with degree 4 is relabeled as Node 6
- Node 1 with degree 5 is relabeled as Node 7
- Node 3 with degree 5 is relabeled as Node 8
- Node 4 with degree 5 is relabeled as Node 9

The edges in the updated graph based on the new labels are:
(0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 5)

By following the rules of degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph. After counting, we find:
Total number of triangles: [10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
