Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 0 - degree 3
Node 4 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 3
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 8 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 6 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 3 - degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles:

- For edge (0, 1):
    Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 5.
    Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
    Shared connections: 0
    Triangle: <0, 1, 2>

- For edge (0, 3):
    Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 5.
    Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
    Shared connections: 0
    Triangle: <0, 3, 2>

- For edge (0, 5):
    Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 5.
    Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
    Shared connections: 0
    Triangle: <0, 5, 6>

- For edge (1, 2):
    Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
    Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
    Shared connections: 1
    Triangle: <1, 2, 0>

- For edge (1, 6):
    Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
    Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
    Shared connections: 1
    Triangle: <1, 6, 2>

- For edge (1, 8):
    Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
    Node 8 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 6.
    Shared connections: 1
    Triangle: <1, 8, 2>

- For edge (3, 2):
    Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
    Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
    Shared connections: 2
    Triangle: <3, 2, 0>

- For edge (3, 6):
    Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
    Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
    Shared connections: 3
    Triangle: <3, 6, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7].
