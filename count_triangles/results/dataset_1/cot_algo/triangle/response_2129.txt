Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
I will first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertices: 1 -- 2 connections
Vertices: 4, 6 -- 3 connections
Vertices: 5 -- 4 connections
Vertices: 0, 2 -- 5 connections
Vertices: 7 -- 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

(0, 1): Shared connections with vertex 7 -> <0, 1, 7>
(0, 2): Shared connections with vertex 7 -> <0, 2, 7>
(0, 4): Shared connections with vertex 5 -> <0, 4, 5>
(0, 6): Shared connections with vertex 7 -> <0, 6, 7>
(0, 7): Shared connections with vertices 1, 2, 6 -> <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 6, 7>
(1, 5): No triangles
(1, 7): Shared connection with vertex 0 -> <0, 1, 7>
(2, 7): Shared connection with vertex 0 -> <0, 2, 7>
(4, 5): No triangles
(5, 7): Shared connection with vertices 0, 1 -> <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 7>
(6, 7): Shared connection with vertices 0 -> <0, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [7] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 7>.
