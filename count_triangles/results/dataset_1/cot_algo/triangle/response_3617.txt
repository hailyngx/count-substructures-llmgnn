Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 7: Degree 0  
Node 5: Degree 1  
Node 4: Degree 2  
Node 8: Degree 2  
Node 3: Degree 3  
Node 6: Degree 3  
Node 2: Degree 4  
Node 1: Degree 5  
Node 9: Degree 5  
Node 0: Degree 6  

After sorting, the edges to consider are:
(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle <1, 2, 9>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] triangles in the given graph.
