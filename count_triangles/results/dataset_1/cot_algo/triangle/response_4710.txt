Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
\[0 \rightarrow 4, \, 1 \rightarrow 3, \, 2 \rightarrow 2, \, 3 \rightarrow 5, \, 4 \rightarrow 1, \, 7 \rightarrow 0, \, 8 \rightarrow 6, \, 9 \rightarrow 7 \]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
