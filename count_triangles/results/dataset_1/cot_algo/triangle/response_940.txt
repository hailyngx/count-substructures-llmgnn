Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles is as follows:

Node degrees:
Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 1

Sorting nodes by degree:
Nodes: 5, 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0, 2

Reordering the graph with sorted nodes:
Edges: (5, 1) (6, 4) (9, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (7, 2) (8, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 3)

Now, we count the triangles:
Triangles: [10]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 6>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 1, 0>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 7, 3>, <7, 3, 2>
