Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes based on their degree:
Node 9 - degree 0
Node 1 - degree 1
Node 3 - degree 1
Node 5 - degree 1
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 2 - degree 3
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 0 - degree 5
Node 6 - degree 5
Node 4 - degree 6
