Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. Triangle <0, 1, 5>
2. Triangle <0, 1, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 7>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 8>
6. Triangle <1, 2, 7>
7. Triangle <1, 2, 8>
8. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
9. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
10. Triangle <1, 6, 8>
11. Triangle <2, 7, 8>
12. Triangle <3, 5, 8>
13. Triangle <3, 9, 2>
14. Triangle <4, 6, 8>
15. Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [15]
