Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections

Next, we will go through each edge in the order specified:

1. Edge (0, 3):
    - Node 0 (degree 1) has fewer connections than Node 3 (degree 4).
    - Check shared connections between node 0 and node 3: None

2. Edge (1, 7):
    - Node 1 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 6).
    - Check shared connections between node 1 and node 7: None

3. Edge (1, 8):
    - Node 1 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 4).
    - Check shared connections between node 1 and node 8: None

4. Edge (2, 6):
    - Node 2 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 6 (degree 4) so we skip this edge.

5. Edge (2, 7):
    - Node 2 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 7 (degree 6) so we skip this edge.

6. Edge (2, 9):
    - Node 2 (degree 5) has more connections than Node 9 (degree 3) so we skip this edge.

7. Edge (3, 6):
    - Node 3 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 6 (degree 4).
    - Check shared connections between node 3 and node 6: None

8. Edge (3, 9):
    - Node 3 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 3).
    - Check shared connections between node 3 and node 9: None

9. Edge (4, 5):
    - Node 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 5 (degree 2).
    - Check shared connections between node 4 and node 5: None

10. Edge (4, 7):
    - Node 4 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 7 (degree 6).
    - Check shared connections between node 4 and node 7: None

11. Edge (5, 8):
    - Node 5 (degree 2) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 4).
    - Check shared connections between node 5 and node 8: None

12. Edge (6, 8):
    - Node 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 8 (degree 4).
    - Check shared connections between node 6 and node 8: None

13. Edge (6, 9):
    - Node 6 (degree 4) has fewer connections than Node 9 (degree 3).
    - Check shared connections between node 6 and node 9: None

14. Edge (7, 8):
    - Node 7 (degree 6) has more connections than Node 8 (degree 4) so we skip this edge.

No triangles are formed in this graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [0] and no unique triangles were found.
