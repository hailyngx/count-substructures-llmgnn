Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we relabel the vertices accordingly: 

0 -> 3 connections  
1 -> 2 connections  
3 -> 2 connections  
5 -> 2 connections  
6 -> 3 connections  
8 -> 3 connections  
7 -> 4 connections  
9 -> 4 connections  
2 -> 5 connections  
4 -> 6 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by considering each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

From the given edges, we identify the following triangles:  
<1, 0, 8>  
<1, 7, 2>  
<1, 7, 4>  
<3, 4, 5>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<7, 2, 9>  
<8, 0, 2>  
<8, 0, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
