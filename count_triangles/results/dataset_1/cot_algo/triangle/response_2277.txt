Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, we get the following relabeling:
Nodes: 
0 (degree 3) -> relabeled to node 0.
7 (degree 1) -> relabeled to node 1.
3 (degree 2) -> relabeled to node 2.
5 (degree 4) -> relabeled to node 3.
8 (degree 3) -> relabeled to node 4.
9 (degree 4) -> relabeled to node 5.
2 (degree 3) -> relabeled to node 6.
4 (degree 5) -> relabeled to node 7.

Based on the given edges, we can see that all edges connect a lower degree node with a higher degree node, so we only consider these edges for counting triangles:

Edges: 
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (8, 9)

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 2, 5>
<4, 8, 9>
