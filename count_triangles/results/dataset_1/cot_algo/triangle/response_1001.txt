Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. The sorted list of vertices is: 

1. Node 1 (Degree 2)
2. Node 6 (Degree 2)
3. Node 8 (Degree 3)
4. Node 3 (Degree 3)
5. Node 5 (Degree 3)
6. Node 9 (Degree 3)
7. Node 7 (Degree 4)
8. Node 4 (Degree 5)
9. Node 2 (Degree 5)
10. Node 0 (Degree 7)

Now, we will analyze the edges starting from the vertices with lower labels and fewer connections. 

1. Analyzing Node 1 (Degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
2. Analyzing Node 6 (Degree 2): No triangles can be formed with this node.
3. Analyzing Node 8 (Degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this node.
4. Analyzing Node 3 (Degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this node.
5. Analyzing Node 5 (Degree 3): No triangles can be formed with this node.
6. Analyzing Node 9 (Degree 3): Possible triangles: <9, 2, 4>.
7. Analyzing Node 7 (Degree 4): No triangles can be formed with this node.
8. Analyzing Node 4 (Degree 5): Possible triangles: <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 2, 3>.
9. Analyzing Node 2 (Degree 5): No triangles can be formed with this node.
10. Analyzing Node 0 (Degree 7): Possible triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7] and the unique triangles found in the graph are <9, 2, 4>, <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 3>, <4, 2, 3>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 1>, <0, 8, 5>.
