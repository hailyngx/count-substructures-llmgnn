Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: <8, 0, 2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 9, 6>.

Counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <0, 7, 9>.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 6) forms triangles with vertices 3 and 7: <3, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 7: <3, 6, 7>.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 5) forms a triangle with vertex 3: <3, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 7) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 9: <0, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 9: <0, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 9) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 6: <0, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <0, 3, 9>.
- Edge (9, 7) forms triangles with vertices 0 and 6: <0, 7, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
