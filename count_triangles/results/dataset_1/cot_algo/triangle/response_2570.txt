Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 3 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection

Ordering the nodes based on their degrees (from least to most connections):
Nodes with 1 connection: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Nodes with 3 connections: 0, 1, 2

Next, we will proceed to count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering:

For the given edges, we follow the order of nodes and check for triangles:
1. Node 3 (0, 3): Does not form a triangle.
2. Node 4 (1, 4): Does not form a triangle.
3. Node 5 (5, 6): Does not form a triangle.
4. Node 6 (6, 5): Does not form a triangle.
5. Node 7 (7, 2): Does not form a triangle.
6. Node 0 (0, 1): Forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.
7. Node 1 (1, 2): Does not form a triangle.
8. Node 2 (0, 2): Forms a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

Total number of triangles: 2
