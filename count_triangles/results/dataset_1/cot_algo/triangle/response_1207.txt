Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 6): No triangles are formed.
2. For edge (1, 3): No triangles are formed.
3. For edge (2, 5): No triangles are formed.
4. For edge (2, 7): No triangles are formed.
5. For edge (2, 8): No triangles are formed.
6. For edge (2, 9): No triangles are formed.
7. For edge (3, 1): No triangles are formed.
8. For edge (3, 4): A triangle is formed: <3, 1, 4>.
9. For edge (3, 6): No triangles are formed.
10. For edge (3, 9): Two triangles are formed: <3, 6, 9> and <3, 4, 9>.
11. For edge (4, 3): A triangle is formed: <4, 3, 1>.
12. For edge (4, 5): No triangles are formed.
13. For edge (4, 7): No triangles are formed.
14. For edge (5, 2): A triangle is formed: <5, 2, 8>.
15. For edge (5, 4): A triangle is formed: <5, 4, 3>.
16. For edge (5, 8): No triangles are formed.
17. For edge (6, 0): No triangles are formed.
18. For edge (6, 3): No triangles are formed.
19. For edge (6, 9): A triangle is formed: <6, 3, 9>.
20. For edge (7, 2): No triangles are formed.
21. For edge (7, 4): No triangles are formed.
22. For edge (8, 2): No triangles are formed.
23. For edge (8, 5): No triangles are formed.
24. For edge (8, 9): A triangle is formed: <8, 2, 9>.
25. For edge (9, 2): A triangle is formed: <9, 2, 8>.
26. For edge (9, 3): Two triangles are formed: <9, 3, 6> and <9, 3, 4>.
27. For edge (9, 6): No triangles are formed.
28. For edge (9, 8): No triangles are formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [11] in the given graph.
