Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows: 

Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.

Following the method described earlier, we find the total number of triangles in the graph to be 3. 

[3]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 8, 9>
