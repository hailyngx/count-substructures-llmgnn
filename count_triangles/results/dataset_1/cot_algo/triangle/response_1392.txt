Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 0 -> connections: 1  
Node 2 -> connections: 2  
Node 8 -> connections: 2  
Node 1 -> connections: 4  
Node 3 -> connections: 4  
Node 4 -> connections: 4  
Node 5 -> connections: 4  
Node 6 -> connections: 4  
Node 7 -> connections: 7  
Node 9 -> connections: 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles using the given edges:
1. (0, 5) forms triangles with (5, 1) and (5, 2) -> <0, 5, 1>, <0, 5, 2>
2. (1, 3) forms a triangle with (3, 7) -> <1, 3, 7>
3. (1, 4) forms a triangle with (4, 7) -> <1, 4, 7>
4. (1, 5) forms a triangle with (5, 2) -> <1, 5, 2>
5. (1, 7) forms triangles with (7, 4), (7, 6), and (7, 9) -> <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 6>, <1, 7, 9>
6. (2, 5) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (2) has more connections
7. (2, 7) forms triangles with (7, 3) and (7, 9) -> <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 9>
8. (3, 1) forms a triangle with (1, 5) -> <3, 1, 5>
9. (3, 6) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (3) has more connections
10. (3, 7) forms triangles with (7, 4), (7, 6), and (7, 9) -> <3, 7, 4>, <3, 7, 6>, <3, 7, 9>
11. (4, 1) forms a triangle with (1, 5) -> <4, 1, 5>
12. (4, 7) forms triangles with (7, 6) and (7, 9) -> <4, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 9>
13. (5, 0) forms triangles with (0, 1) and (0, 2) -> <5, 0, 1>, <5, 0, 2>
14. (5, 1) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (1) has more connections
15. (5, 2) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (2) has more connections
16. (6, 3) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (3) has more connections
17. (6, 7) forms triangles with (7, 4) and (7, 9) -> <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 9>
18. (6, 9) forms a triangle with (9, 7) -> <6, 9, 7>
19. (7, 1) forms triangles with (1, 5), (1, 4), and (1, 7) -> <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 4>, <7, 1, 7>
20. (7, 2) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (2) has more connections
21. (7, 3) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (3) has more connections
22. (7, 4) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (4) has more connections
23. (7, 6) forms triangles with (6, 9) and (6, 3) -> <7, 6, 9>, <7, 6, 3>
24. (7, 9) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (9) has more connections
25. (9, 6) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (6) has more connections
26. (9, 7) does not form a triangle as the vertex with the lower label (7) has more connections

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
