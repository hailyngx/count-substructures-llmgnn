Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
(9: 1), (8: 3), (0: 4), (5: 4), (4: 4), (2: 4), (6: 5), (1: 6), (3: 5), (7: 7)

Following the method, we start with the edge involving vertex 0 since it has the lowest degree among the connected vertices.
After sorting the edges based on the lower labeled vertex, we have:
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 5), (8, 5)

By examining the shared neighbors, we can count the number of triangles:
[12]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <4, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
