Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections (degree). In this case, the degrees of each node are as follows: 

Node 0: degree 2  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 2  
Node 3: degree 5  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 2  

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, we get:  
Node 0 (degree 2)  
Node 1 (degree 2)  
Node 2 (degree 2)  
Node 3 (degree 5)  
Node 4 (degree 4)  
Node 5 (degree 4)  
Node 6 (degree 4)  
Node 7 (degree 3)  
Node 8 (degree 3)  
Node 9 (degree 2)  

Using the degree-based ordering, the edges that qualify for counting triangles are:  
- (0, 2)  
- (0, 8)  
- (1, 3)  
- (2, 8)  
- (3, 4)  
- (3, 5)  
- (3, 6)  
- (4, 6)  
- (5, 7)  
- (5, 9)  

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:  
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>  
- Triangle <3, 4, 6>  
- Triangle <3, 5, 7>  
- Triangle <3, 5, 9>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
