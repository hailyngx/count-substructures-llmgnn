Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Number of connections for each node:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Relabeling the nodes based on the number of connections:
Node 9: 0 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections

Checking edges based on the relabeling:
Edge (1, 2) - Both nodes have 3 connections, so continue
Edge (1, 7) - Node 7 has 2 connections, so proceed
Edge (1, 8) - Node 7 has 2 connections, so proceed
Edge (2, 4) - Node 4 has 1 connection, forming a triangle <1, 2, 4>
Edge (2, 5) - Node 5 has 3 connections, so proceed
Edge (2, 8) - Both nodes have 4 connections, so continue
Edge (4, 5) - Both nodes have 3 connections, so continue
Edge (5, 8) - Node 8 has 4 connections, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>
Edge (7, 9) - Node 9 has 0 connections, forming a triangle <7, 1, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 8>, <7, 1, 9>
