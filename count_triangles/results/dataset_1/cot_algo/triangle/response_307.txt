Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 9 connections.
Node 8 has 7 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now traverse through the edges and count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 9. 
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangle is formed with this edge.
3. Edge (0, 9): No triangle is formed with this edge.
4. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 7.
5. Edge (1, 7): No triangle is formed with this edge.
6. Edge (1, 9): No triangle is formed with this edge.
7. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
8. Edge (2, 1): Already counted.
9. Edge (2, 4): No triangle is formed with this edge.
10. Edge (2, 6): No triangle is formed with this edge.
11. Edge (2, 7): Already counted.
12. Edge (2, 8): No triangle is formed with this edge.
13. Edge (2, 9): Already counted.
14. Edge (3, 5): No triangle is formed with this edge.
15. Edge (3, 6): No triangle is formed with this edge.
16. Edge (3, 8): Node 3, Node 8, and Node 6 form a triangle.
17. Edge (4, 2): No triangle is formed with this edge.
18. Edge (5, 3): No triangle is formed with this edge.
19. Edge (6, 2): Already counted.
20. Edge (6, 3): No triangle is formed with this edge.
21. Edge (6, 8): Node 6, Node 8, and Node 7 form a triangle.
22. Edge (7, 1): Already counted.
23. Edge (7, 2): Already counted.
24. Edge (7, 8): Node 7, Node 8, and Node 6 form a triangle.
25. Edge (8, 0): No triangle is formed with this edge.
26. Edge (8, 2): Already counted.
27. Edge (8, 3): Node 8, Node 3, and Node 6 form a triangle.
28. Edge (8, 6): Already counted.
29. Edge (8, 7): Already counted.
30. Edge (9, 0): No triangle is formed with this edge.
31. Edge (9, 1): No triangle is formed with this edge.
32. Edge (9, 2): Already counted.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
