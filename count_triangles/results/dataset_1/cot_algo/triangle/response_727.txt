Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is:
Vertex 8: degree 1
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 4: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 5
Vertex 3: degree 5
Vertex 9: degree 6
Vertex 2: degree 6

Now, we will go through the edges in order of the vertex with the lowest label.

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [9]
