Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 1

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can relabel the nodes as follows:
- Node 7 (Degree 1) -> Label 0
- Node 9 (Degree 1) -> Label 1
- Node 0 (Degree 2) -> Label 2
- Node 2 (Degree 2) -> Label 3
- Node 4 (Degree 2) -> Label 4
- Node 5 (Degree 3) -> Label 5
- Node 8 (Degree 3) -> Label 6
- Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Label 7
- Node 6 (Degree 5) -> Label 8

Now, let's consider each edge in the order specified:

1. (0, 5): Nodes 2 and 4 are connected through node 7.
2. (0, 8): No triangle is formed.
3. (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 4 are connected through node 7.
4. (3, 2): Nodes 2 and 4 are connected through node 7.
5. (3, 4): <2, 3, 4>
6. (3, 6): <0, 3, 6>
7. (3, 7): No triangle is formed.
8. (4, 3): <2, 3, 4>
9. (4, 6): <0, 4, 6>
10. (5, 0): Nodes 2 and 4 are connected through node 7.
11. (5, 6): <0, 5, 6>
12. (5, 9): No triangle is formed.
13. (6, 3): <0, 3, 6>
14. (6, 4): <2, 4, 6>
15. (6, 5): <0, 5, 6>
16. (6, 8): No triangle is formed.
17. (7, 3): No triangle is formed.
18. (8, 0): No triangle is formed.
19. (8, 6): No triangle is formed.
20. (9, 5): No triangle is formed.

Counting the total number of triangles found: [5]
