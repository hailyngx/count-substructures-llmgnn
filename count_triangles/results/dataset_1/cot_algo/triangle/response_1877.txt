Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

1. Vertex 7 (Degree 1)
2. Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
3. Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
4. Vertex 8 (Degree 2)
5. Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
6. Vertex 0 (Degree 3)
7. Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
8. Vertex 6 (Degree 3)
9. Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
10. Vertex 2 (Degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

The triangles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 4>
2. <0, 3, 9>
3. <0, 6, 8>
4. <1, 5, 9>
5. <2, 3, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
