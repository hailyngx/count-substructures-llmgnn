Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is: 
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method (considering only edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections), the triangles formed are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 6, 2>
- <0, 7, 5>
- <2, 4, 9>
- <2, 6, 4>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 1>
- <7, 8, 4>
- <7, 8, 9>

There are 10 triangles in total, thus the answer is: [10].
