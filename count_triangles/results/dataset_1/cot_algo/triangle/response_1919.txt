Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
1. Vertex 4: 0 connections
2. Vertex 1: 1 connection
3. Vertex 0: 2 connections
4. Vertex 5: 2 connections
5. Vertex 6: 2 connections
6. Vertex 9: 2 connections
7. Vertex 7: 3 connections
8. Vertex 8: 4 connections
9. Vertex 3: 4 connections
10. Vertex 2: 5 connections

Next, we will list the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edges to consider:
(0, 2)
(0, 8)
(2, 7)
(2, 9)
(5, 1)
(6, 3)
(6, 9)

Now, we will check for shared connections to count the triangles:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 8>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 7>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 8>
4. Triangle <6, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
