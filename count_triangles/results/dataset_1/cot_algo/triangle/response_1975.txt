Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 0 has degree 1.
Node 4 has degree 1.
Node 7 has degree 1.
Node 6 has degree 2.
Node 8 has degree 2.
Node 9 has degree 3.
Node 5 has degree 4.
Node 2 has degree 5.
Node 3 has degree 5.
Node 1 has degree 6.

Now, we relabel the vertices based on their degree in ascending order:
Node 0 → 0
Node 4 → 1
Node 7 → 2
Node 6 → 3
Node 8 → 4
Node 9 → 5
Node 5 → 6
Node 2 → 7
Node 3 → 8
Node 1 → 9

Next, we examine the edges, starting from the edge with the lowest labeled vertex:
Edges involved: (0, 4), (6, 1), (9, 6), (5, 9), (5, 7), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8)

Now, we count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Triangles found: <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 9>

Finally, we present the total number of triangles in the graph: [3].
