Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly: 

Nodes with their respective degrees in parentheses:
- Node 5 (1)
- Node 9 (1)
- Node 8 (2)
- Node 4 (2)
- Node 7 (3)
- Node 3 (3)
- Node 2 (3)
- Node 1 (4)
- Node 6 (4)
- Node 0 (4)

Analyzing the edges based on the relabeled vertices, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6].
