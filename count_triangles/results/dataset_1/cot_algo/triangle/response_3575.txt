Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 7: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(0,3), (0,8), (1,5), (2,3), (2,7), (2,9), (3,8), (3,9), (2,7), (2,9), (5,1), (5,7), (5,9), (5,7), (5,9), (5,9)

By examining the shared connections between the vertices connected by each edge, we find the following triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
