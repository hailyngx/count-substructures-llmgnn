Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 7 has degree 1
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 1
- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 7 has degree 1
- Vertex 4 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 1
- Vertex 3 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 3

Based on the sorted order, the new labels are:
1: 1
7: 2
4: 3
6: 4
1: 5
7: 6
4: 7
6: 8
3: 9
5: 10

Checking the edges, we see that we can form triangles:
- (0, 9) shares a connection with 0 and 9, thus a triangle is formed: <0, 9, 2>
- (2, 9) shares a connection with 2 and 9, thus a triangle is formed: <9, 2, 5>

Count of triangles found in the graph: [2]
