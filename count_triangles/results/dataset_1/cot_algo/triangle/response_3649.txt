Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:  
Vertex 0 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 2 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 5 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 6 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 8 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 9 has 1 connection.  
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.  
Vertex 7 has 0 connections.  
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.  
Vertex 3 has 5 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we have the following triangles:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <3, 0, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
