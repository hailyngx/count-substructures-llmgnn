Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then relabel them accordingly: 

Node 7 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 1
Node 9 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 3
Node 5 - degree 3
Node 1 - degree 3
Node 4 - degree 3
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 4
Node 6 - degree 5

Now, we look at each edge and count the triangles formed:

(0, 2): Share a connection with 1 -> Triangle: <0, 1, 2>
(0, 4): Share a connection with 6 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
(0, 6): Share connections with 1 and 4 -> Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
(1, 2): Share a connection with 0 -> Triangle: <0, 1, 2>
(1, 5): Share a connection with 3 -> Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
(1, 6): Share connections with 0 and 4 -> Triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 4, 6>
(3, 5): Share a connection with 1 -> Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
(3, 7): Share a connection with 9 -> Triangle: <3, 7, 9>
(3, 9): Share a connection with 7 -> Triangle: <3, 7, 9>
(4, 6): Share a connection with 0 -> Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
(5, 3): Share a connection with 1 -> Triangle: <1, 3, 5>
(6, 9): Share a connection with 3 -> Triangle: <3, 6, 9>

Total number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
