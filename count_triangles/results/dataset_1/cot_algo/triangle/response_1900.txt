Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted based on their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 4)

Now, we will proceed to count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 4, 7>
2. <4, 5, 6>
3. <1, 3, 5>
4. <1, 5, 6>
5. <2, 5, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
