Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 0: 1 edge
Node 4: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 1: 5 edges
Node 6: 6 edges
Node 2: 9 edges

Next, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 0 (degree 1) becomes Node 0
Node 4 (degree 2) becomes Node 1
Node 7 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
Node 8 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
Node 9 (degree 3) becomes Node 4
Node 3 (degree 4) becomes Node 5
Node 1 (degree 5) becomes Node 6
Node 6 (degree 6) becomes Node 7
Node 2 (degree 9) becomes Node 8

Following the rule that for each edge we proceed only if the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, we count the number of triangles formed:

Triangles: 
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 6, 1>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 1>
<4, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 3>

Count of triangles = [13]
