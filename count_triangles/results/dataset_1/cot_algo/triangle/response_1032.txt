Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 9), (0, 3), (0, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 2), (8, 4)

After examining the shared connections between vertices with lower labels for each edge, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 3, 5>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
