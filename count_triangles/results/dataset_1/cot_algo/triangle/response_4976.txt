Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph with the specified edges is as follows:

The vertices sorted by their degree are:  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 8: 1 connection  
Node 0: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 4: 4 connections  
Node 9: 5 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 6: 4 connections  
Node 7: 8 connections  

Considering edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections, and checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:  
1. <0, 7, 9>  
2. <0, 7, 1>  
3. <0, 7, 3>  
4. <1, 2, 5>  
5. <1, 2, 6>  
6. <1, 5, 4>  
7. <1, 5, 6>  
8. <1, 5, 7>  
9. <1, 6, 4>  
10. <1, 6, 5>  
11. <1, 6, 7>  
12. <1, 4, 5>  
13. <2, 6, 4>  
14. <4, 5, 6>  
15. <4, 5, 7>  
16. <4, 6, 7>  
17. <5, 6, 7>  
18. <6, 7, 3>  
19. <7, 3, 9>  

Therefore, there are a total of [19] triangles in the given graph.
