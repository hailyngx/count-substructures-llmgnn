Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices by degree:
0 - degree 6
1 - degree 4
2 - degree 3
3 - degree 2
4 - degree 6
5 - degree 4
6 - degree 2
7 - degree 2
8 - degree 4
9 - degree 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 3
1 -> 6
2 -> 0
3 -> 2
4 -> 7
5 -> 5
6 -> 1
7 -> 4
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

Now, we will examine each edge:

Edge (3, 6): Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles.
Edge (3, 0): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, so proceed.
Triangle found: <3, 0, 2>
Edge (3, 2): Both vertices have 3 connections. No triangles.
Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 6 connections, so proceed.
Triangle found: <3, 0, 6>
Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have 4 connections. No triangles.
Edge (0, 5): Vertex 5 has 4 connections, so proceed.
No triangles.
Edge (3, 5): Both vertices have 4 connections. No triangles.
Edge (5, 7): Both vertices have 2 connections. No triangles.
Edge (5, 4): Vertex 4 has 6 connections, so proceed.
Triangle found: <3, 5, 7>
Edge (5, 8): Vertex 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
Triangle found: <3, 5, 8>
Edge (6, 1): Vertex 6 has 2 connections, so proceed.
No triangles.
Edge (7, 4): Vertex 4 has 6 connections, so proceed.
Triangle found: <3, 7, 0>
Edge (8, 4): Vertex 8 has 4 connections, so proceed.
No triangles.
Edge (9, 4): Vertex 9 has 2 connections, so proceed.
No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <3, 0, 2>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>
