Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph:

Node degrees:
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 5 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 7: 2 connections
- Node 8: 6 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Sorting by degree:
1. Node 3
2. Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9
3. Node 4
4. Node 2
5. Node 0, Node 8

Analyzing edges with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with Node 8, forming triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles
- Edge (2, 0): Shared connection with Node 4, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (2, 1): Shared connection with Node 8, forming triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with Node 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with Node 1 and Node 0, forming triangle <0, 1, 2> and triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles
- Edge (4, 0): Shared connections with Nodes 2 and 8, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (4, 2): Shared connection with Node 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (4, 5): Shared connection with Node 8, forming triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (4, 8): Shared connections with Nodes 0 and 2, forming another triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (5, 4): Shared connection with Node 8, forming triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (7, 0): No triangles
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles
- Edge (8, 0): Shared connections with Nodes 2, 4, and 5, forming triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Edge (8, 1): Shared connection with Node 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (8, 2): Shared connections with Nodes 0 and 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 2> and triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Edge (8, 4): Shared connections with Nodes 0 and 2, forming another triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (8, 5): Shared connection with Node 4, forming triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles

Number of triangles: [8]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <4, 5, 8>
