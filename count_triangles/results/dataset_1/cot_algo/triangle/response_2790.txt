Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices by their number of connections, and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:

0: 1 connection
4: 1 connection
5: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
6: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by checking for shared connections. 

Triangles:
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 9>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
