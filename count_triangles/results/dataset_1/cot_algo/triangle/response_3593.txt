Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degree are:  
Node 2 with degree 1  
Node 4 with degree 1  
Node 7 with degree 1  
Node 9 with degree 1  
Node 5 with degree 2  
Node 1 with degree 3  
Node 6 with degree 3  
Node 8 with degree 4  
Node 3 with degree 4  
Node 0 with degree 4  

Calculating the triangles:  
Triangle 1: <0, 1, 5>  
Triangle 2: <0, 1, 7>  
Triangle 3: <0, 1, 9>  
Triangle 4: <0, 5, 6>  
Triangle 5: <3, 6, 8>  

Total number of triangles: [5]
