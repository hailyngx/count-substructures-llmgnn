Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices become:  
Node 0 has 1 connection  
Node 1 has 2 connections  
Node 4 has 1 connection  
Node 7 has 2 connections  
Node 8 has 1 connection  
Node 3 has 2 connections  
Node 5 has 3 connections  
Node 9 has 3 connections  
Node 2 has 4 connections  
Node 6 has 5 connections  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.  

Checking the edges:
Edge (0, 4) - No triangle formed  
Edge (1, 3) - No triangle formed  
Edge (1, 6) - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>  
Edge (2, 6) - Triangle formed: <2, 6, 1>  
Edge (2, 8) - No triangle formed  
Edge (2, 9) - No triangle formed  
Edge (3, 5) - No triangle formed  
Edge (5, 7) - Triangle formed: <5, 7, 6>  
Edge (5, 6) - Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>  
Edge (5, 7) - No triangle formed  
Edge (6, 9) - Triangle formed: <6, 9, 2>  

Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 6>, <2, 6, 1>, <5, 7, 6>, <6, 9, 2>
