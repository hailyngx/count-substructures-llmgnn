Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to organize the vertices based on their degrees:

0 - degree 2
2 - degree 2
9 - degree 2

4 - degree 3
7 - degree 3

3 - degree 4
6 - degree 4
8 - degree 4

1 - degree 5
5 - degree 5

Now, we can count the number of triangles:

- Vertex 0 forms 1 triangle with vertices 1 and 4: <0, 1, 4>
- Vertex 1 forms 2 triangles with vertices 0 and 2: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 7>
- Vertex 2 forms 1 triangle with vertices 1 and 3: <1, 2, 3>
- Vertex 3 forms 2 triangles with vertices 2 and 5: <2, 3, 5>, <3, 5, 6>
- Vertex 4 forms 1 triangle with vertices 0 and 5: <0, 4, 5>
- Vertex 5 forms 1 triangle with vertices 3 and 6: <3, 5, 6>
- Vertex 6 forms 1 triangle with vertices 3 and 7: <3, 6, 7>
- Vertex 7 forms 1 triangle with vertices 1 and 6: <1, 7, 6>
- Vertex 8 forms 2 triangles with vertices 1 and 7: <1, 7, 8>, <3, 8, 7>
- Vertex 9 forms 1 triangle with vertices 5 and 6: <5, 9, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
