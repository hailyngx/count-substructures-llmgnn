Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:
- Vertex 4 has 0 connections
- Vertices 1, 9 have 1 connection each
- Vertices 0, 2, 5 have 2 connections each
- Vertices 3, 7 have 3 connections each
- Vertices 6, 8 have 4 connections each

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles as follows:
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <3, 6, 7>
- Triangle <6, 7, 5>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] triangles in the given graph.
