Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for each vertex are:
- Node 0 with degree 3
- Node 1 with degree 2
- Node 2 with degree 4
- Node 5 with degree 2
- Node 7 with degree 3
- Node 8 with degree 1
- Node 4 with degree 2
- Node 6 with degree 4
- Node 9 with degree 3
- Node 3 with degree 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles formed within this graph: 

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 0, 8>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 3>

Total number of triangles: [11]
