Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertices: 5, 0, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 6, 7, 3

Now, counting the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 3>
3. <0, 3, 4>
4. <1, 4, 9>
5. <1, 8, 9>
6. <6, 7, 9>
7. <6, 8, 9>
8. <7, 6, 9>
9. <8, 6, 9>
10. <3, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
