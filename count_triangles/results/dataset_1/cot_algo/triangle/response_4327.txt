Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most.

The sorted order of vertices based on their degrees is:
Vertex 3 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 2
Vertex 0 - Degree 3
Vertex 1 - Degree 3
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 5 - Degree 4
Vertex 7 - Degree 4
Vertex 9 - Degree 5
Vertex 4 - Degree 6
Vertex 2 - Degree 6

Now, let's count the triangles based on this ordering:

1. For edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, and Vertex 4 has 6 connections. As Vertex 3 has fewer connections, we proceed. Shared connections: 4
2. For edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections. As Vertex 3 has fewer connections, we proceed. Shared connections: 5
3. For edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 has 2 connections, and Vertex 6 has 2 connections. As Vertex 3 has fewer connections, we proceed. Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found:
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
