Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2

The sorted nodes by degree are: 0, 2, 9, 3, 4, 6, 8, 1, 5, 7

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. For the edge (0, 1):
   - Node 0 is connected to 1.
   - There are no nodes connected to both 0 and 1.
   
2. For the edge (0, 9):
   - Node 0 is connected to 9.
   - There are no nodes connected to both 0 and 9.

3. For the edge (1, 4):
   - Node 1 is connected to 4.
   - There are no nodes connected to both 1 and 4.

...
(continuing for all edges)

After counting, we find that the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, and <4, 5, 7>.
