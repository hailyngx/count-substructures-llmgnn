Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
Triangles: 
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<1, 3, 2>
<1, 9, 2>
<3, 7, 5>
<8, 5, 4>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 2>

Total number of triangles: [9]
