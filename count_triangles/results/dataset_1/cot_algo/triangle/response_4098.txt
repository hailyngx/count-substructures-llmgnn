Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels are as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 8 has 4 connections.
- Node 5 has 4 connections.
- Node 6 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we start with edges involving nodes with the lower labels and fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 3, 7>.
- Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with node 6: <1, 5, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with node 5: <1, 6, 5>.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with node 8: <3, 4, 8>.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) forms a triangle with node 6: <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with node 7: <6, 9, 7>.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 4, 8>, and <4, 5, 6>.
