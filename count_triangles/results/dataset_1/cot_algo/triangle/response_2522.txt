Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
Nodes: 4, 5, 9, 5, 3, 10, 3, 10, 9, 5

Now, we can relabel the nodes accordingly: 
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles: 3
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 7, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
