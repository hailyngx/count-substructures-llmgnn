Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
1. Node 5 (Degree: 0)
2. Node 6 (Degree: 2)
3. Node 1 (Degree: 2)
4. Node 5 (Degree: 2)
5. Node 9 (Degree: 3)
6. Node 3 (Degree: 3)
7. Node 8 (Degree: 3)
8. Node 7 (Degree: 3)
9. Node 0 (Degree: 4)
10. Node 4 (Degree: 4)
