Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 1: 3 connections (vertex 8)
- Vertex 2: 3 connections (vertex 4)
- Vertex 3: 3 connections (vertex 5)
- Vertex 4: 2 connections (vertex 2)
- Vertex 5: 2 connections (vertex 0)
- Vertex 6: 2 connections (vertex 9)
- Vertex 7: 2 connections (vertex 3)
- Vertex 8: 1 connection (vertex 6)
- Vertex 9: 1 connection (vertex 7)
- Vertex 10: 1 connection (vertex 1)

Now, we will count the triangles based on the given edges using the relabeled vertices. The triangles are as follows: 
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
