Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are: 2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 5, 9, 7, 0.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: (2, 8), (3, 4), (1, 5), (5, 9), (4, 1), (9, 7), (7, 5), (8, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (0, 7), (3, 7), (3, 9), (9, 5), (5, 1), (4, 3).

By examining these edges and looking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find that the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 7, 1>, <0, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 2>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 0>, <3, 9, 7>, <4, 1, 5>, <5, 7, 9>.
