Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 1 connection
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
1: 1 connection
3: 1 connection
6: 1 connection
0: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections
4: 5 connections
5: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles:
(0, 4) and (0, 5) share connection 5, forming triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(4, 0) and (4, 5) share connection 5, forming triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(4, 0) and (4, 8) share connection 8, forming triangle <0, 4, 8>.
(4, 8) and (4, 9) share connection 4, forming triangle <4, 8, 9>.
(4, 9) and (4, 5) share connection 5, forming triangle <4, 5, 9>.
(5, 0) and (5, 3) share connection 3, forming triangle <0, 3, 5>.
(5, 4) and (5, 0) share connection 0, forming triangle <0, 4, 5>.
(5, 4) and (5, 3) share connection 3, forming triangle <3, 4, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 8>, <4, 8, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 5>, and <3, 4, 5>.
