Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 1
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5

Examining the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
- Node 0 (degree 1) is connected to Node 3 (degree 5), forming triangles with:
  - <0, 3, x> (where x is any common neighbor of Node 0 and 3)
- Node 2 (degree 2) is connected to Node 5 (degree 4), forming triangles with:
  - <2, 5, x> (where x is any common neighbor of Node 2 and 5)
- Node 2 (degree 2) is connected to Node 6 (degree 2), forming triangles with:
  - <2, 6, x> (where x is any common neighbor of Node 2 and 6)
- Node 6 (degree 2) is connected to Node 9 (degree 5), forming triangles with:
  - <6, 9, x> (where x is any common neighbor of Node 6 and 9)
- Node 4 (degree 3) is connected to Node 8 (degree 4), forming triangles with:
  - <4, 8, x> (where x is any common neighbor of Node 4 and 8)

Counting the triangles formed: [5]
