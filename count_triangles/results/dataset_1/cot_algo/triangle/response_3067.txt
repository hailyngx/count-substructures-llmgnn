Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 9 (Degree 4)
Node 3 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 7 (Degree 3)
Node 4 (Degree 3)
Node 5 (Degree 3)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 0 (Degree 2)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 1)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge in the order specified:
- Edge (0, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7> and <1, 3, 5>.
