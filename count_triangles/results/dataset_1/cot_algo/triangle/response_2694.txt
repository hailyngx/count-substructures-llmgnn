Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following list of vertices: 

0 (degree 1)  
1 (degree 1)  
8 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 2)  
9 (degree 3)  
5 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 3)  
3 (degree 3)  
7 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 4)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge starting from vertices with lower degrees. 

For the given edges, we can find the triangles formed: 

From edge (0, 2): No triangle formed.  
From edge (1, 9): No triangle formed.  
From edge (2, 0): No triangle formed.  
From edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 7>.  
From edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.  
From edge (3, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 7>.  
From edge (3, 7): No triangle formed.  
From edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.  
From edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.  
From edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.  
From edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.  
From edge (5, 7): Triangle <5, 7, 9>.  
From edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.  
From edge (6, 4): No triangle formed.  
From edge (6, 8): No triangle formed.  
From edge (7, 3): No triangle formed.  
From edge (7, 5): Triangle <5, 7, 9>.  
From edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.  
From edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.  
From edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.  
From edge (8, 7): No triangle formed.  
From edge (9, 1): No triangle formed.  
From edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.  
From edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.  

Count of triangles: [2]  
Triangles: <2, 3, 7>, <5, 7, 9>
