Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
Vertices with their degrees:
(0, 2)
(1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 2)
(4, 2)
(5, 1)
(6, 7)
(7, 3)
(9, 2)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
(1, 1)
(5, 1)
(0, 2)
(2, 2)
(3, 2)
(4, 2)
(9, 2)
(7, 3)
(6, 7)

We will iterate through each edge and count the triangles:
Triangles: 
[7] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 
Unique triangles found: 
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
