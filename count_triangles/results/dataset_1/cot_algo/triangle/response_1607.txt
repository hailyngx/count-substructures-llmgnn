Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method.

Sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 
Node 6: Degree 0
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4

Edges to be considered based on the method:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0)

Calculating triangles:
- For edge (0, 2): Forms triangle <0, 2, 3>
- For edge (0, 4): Forms triangle <0, 4, 3>
- For edge (0, 9): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (1, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (2, 3): Forms triangle <2, 3, 4>
- For edge (2, 5): Forms triangle <2, 5, 7>
- For edge (3, 4): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (3, 8): Forms triangle <3, 8, 7>
- For edge (4, 0): Forms triangle <4, 0, 3>
- For edge (5, 2): Forms triangle <5, 2, 3>
- For edge (5, 7): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (7, 5): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (7, 8): Forms triangle <7, 8, 1>
- For edge (8, 1): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (8, 3): Does not form a triangle.
- For edge (8, 7): Forms triangle <8, 7, 5>
- For edge (9, 0): Does not form a triangle.
