Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the graph. Let's follow the steps:

1. Sort vertices by the number of connections (degree):
Vertices sorted: 2, 9, 5, 8, 3, 1, 7, 0, 6, 4

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
New labels: 
0 - 0, 1 - 1, 2 - 2, 3 - 3, 4 - 4, 5 - 5, 6 - 6, 7 - 7, 8 - 8, 9 - 9

3. Check each edge and count triangles:
Triangles found: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <4, 7, 8>

4. Count the total number of triangles: 
[10]

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is 10.
