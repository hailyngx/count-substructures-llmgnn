Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes by their degrees, from least to most connected:

Nodes: 0(1), 4(1), 9(1), 7(2), 1(2), 4(2), 3(3), 9(3), 8(4), 2(7)

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly: 

Nodes: 0(1), 1(2), 2(3), 3(4), 4(5), 6(6), 7(7), 8(8), 9(9)

Next, we will analyze each edge based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection.
2. Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 8): Node 2, Node 7, and Node 8 form a triangle <2, 7, 8>.
7. Edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 6): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (4, 1): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (6, 3): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (6, 7): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (6, 8): Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 form a triangle <6, 7, 8>.
15. Edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (9, 2): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles: <2, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
