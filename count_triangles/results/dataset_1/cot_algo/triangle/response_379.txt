Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the given graph:

1. First, we sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 2 has 2 connections.
Vertex 3 has 4 connections.
Vertex 4 has 4 connections.
Vertex 5 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 4 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 9 has 4 connections.

2. Relabel the vertices from lowest to highest based on the degree:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9, 8

3. Using the relabeled vertices, we focus on the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<0, 2> shares a connection with 7 forming triangle <0, 2, 7>.
<0, 7> not included as 7 has more connections than 0.
<1, 6> not included as 1 has more connections than 6.
<2, 8> shares a connection with 3 forming triangle <2, 8, 3>.
<3, 4> shares a connection with 9 forming triangle <3, 4, 9>.
<3, 5> not included as 3 has more connections than 5.
<4, 5> not included as 5 has more connections than 4.
<6, 7> shares a connection with 8 forming triangle <6, 7, 8>.
<7, 8> shares a connection with 6 forming triangle <7, 8, 6>.
<8, 9> shares a connection with 3 forming triangle <8, 9, 3>.

Therefore, there are 4 triangles in total: [<0, 2, 7>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 8>].
