Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 5 has 1 connection.
Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 4, 8 have 3 connections each.
Node 0 has 7 connections.

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degree:

Node 5 (degree 1) will be labeled as 0.
Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 (degree 2) will be labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively.
Nodes 4, 8 (degree 3) will be labeled as 7, 8 respectively.
Node 0 (degree 7) will be labeled as 9.

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

For the edge (0, 1):

Node 0 (9) has connections with nodes 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (3), 5 (0).
This forms triangles <0, 1, 5> and <0, 1, 2>.

For the rest of the edges:
(0, 2): <0, 2, 5>
(0, 3): <0, 3, 5>
(0, 5): <0, 5, 1>
(0, 7): No triangle
(0, 8): No triangle
(0, 9): No triangle
(1, 2): <1, 2, 0>
(1, 3): <1, 3, 0>
(1, 5): <1, 5, 0>
(2, 4): <2, 4, 0>
(3, 4): <3, 4, 0>
(4, 6): No triangle
(4, 7): <4, 7, 0>
(5, 0): No triangle
(6, 8): No triangle
(7, 4): No triangle
(8, 0): No triangle
(8, 6): No triangle
(8, 9): No triangle
(9, 0): No triangle

The total number of triangles is [7].
