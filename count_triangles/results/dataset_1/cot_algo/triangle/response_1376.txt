Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's order the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 1
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 1 has degree 6
Node 6 has degree 7

We will now relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 7 → 0
Node 0 → 1
Node 4 → 2
Node 5 → 3
Node 3 → 4
Node 9 → 5
Node 2 → 6
Node 8 → 7
Node 1 → 8
Node 6 → 9

Now we will examine each edge in the graph based on the relabeled nodes:
(1, 3) forms a triangle with 5: <1, 3, 5>
(1, 4) forms a triangle with 2: <1, 4, 2>
(1, 5) forms a triangle with 3: <1, 5, 3>
(1, 8) forms a triangle with 2, 5, 6, 9: <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 8, 6>, <1, 8, 9>
(1, 9) forms a triangle with 5, 6: <1, 9, 5>, <1, 9, 6>
(3, 4) forms a triangle with 1: <3, 4, 1>
(4, 2) forms a triangle with 1: <4, 2, 1>
(5, 3) forms a triangle with 1: <5, 3, 1>
(6, 2) forms a triangle with 1: <6, 2, 1>
(6, 3) forms a triangle with 1, 2: <6, 3, 1>, <6, 3, 2>
(6, 8) forms a triangle with 1, 2, 5, 9: <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
