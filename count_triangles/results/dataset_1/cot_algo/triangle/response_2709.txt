Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by the number of connections, we have the following new labels for the nodes:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 0
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges in the following order:
1. Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 have 2 shared connections - Node 7 and Node 2. This forms triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Node 0 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection - Node 2. This forms triangle <0, 7, 2>.
3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 have 2 shared connections - Node 0 and Node 4. This forms triangle <1, 2, 0>.
4. Edge (2, 7): Node 2 and Node 7 have 1 shared connection - Node 0. This forms triangle <2, 7, 0>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
