Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then proceeding through the edges one by one. Here's the process for the given graph:

Vertex degrees:
0: 2
1: 2
2: 2
3: 2
4: 3
5: 1
6: 2
7: 2
8: 5
9: 4

Sorted vertices: 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 9, 8

Edge (0, 5) skipped as 5 has fewer connections
Edge (0, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 8: <0, 8, 4>
Edge (1, 4) skipped as 1 has fewer connections
Edge (1, 9) skipped as 1 has fewer connections
Edge (2, 7) skipped as 2 has fewer connections
Edge (3, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 8: <3, 8, 4>
Edge (3, 9) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <3, 9, 6>
Edge (4, 1) skipped as 1 has fewer connections
Edge (4, 7) forms triangle with shared connection 7: <4, 7, 2>
Edge (4, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 8: <4, 8, 0>
Edge (5, 0) skipped as 5 has fewer connections
Edge (6, 8) forms triangle with shared connection 8: <6, 8, 4>
Edge (6, 9) forms triangle with shared connection 9: <6, 9, 3>
Edge (7, 2) skipped as 2 has fewer connections
Edge (7, 4) forms triangle with shared connection 4: <7, 4, 8>
Edge (8, 0) skipped as 0 has fewer connections
Edge (8, 3) forms triangle with shared connection 3: <8, 3, 9>
Edge (8, 4) forms triangle with shared connection 4: <8, 4, 7>
Edge (8, 6) forms triangle with shared connection 6: <8, 6, 9>
Edge (8, 9) forms triangle with shared connections 9, 4, 6: <8, 9, 6> and <8, 9, 4>
Edge (9, 1) skipped as 1 has fewer connections
Edge (9, 3) forms triangle with shared connection 3: <9, 3, 8>
Edge (9, 6) forms triangle with shared connection 6: <9, 6, 8>
Edge (9, 8) forms triangle with shared connections 8, 4, 6: <9, 8, 6> and <9, 8, 4>

Total number of triangles: [15]

Unique triangles found: <0, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 8, 0>, <6, 8, 4>, <6, 9, 3>, <7, 4, 8>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 4, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, <8, 9, 4>, <8, 9, 6>, <9, 3, 8>, <9, 6, 8>
