Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

The sorted vertices are: 4, 3, 5, 6, 8, 2, 9, 1, 7, 0

Now, let's count the triangles:

- Edge (2, 5) (vertices 5 and 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (2, 7) (vertices 7 and 2): No triangle formed.
- Edge (2, 9) (vertices 9 and 2): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 9>
- Edge (3, 6) (vertices 6 and 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (3, 8) (vertices 8 and 3): No triangle formed.
- Edge (5, 1) (vertices 1 and 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 2. Triangle: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (5, 2) (vertices 2 and 5): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 5>
- Edge (6, 0) (vertices 0 and 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (6, 3) (vertices 3 and 6): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 0) (vertices 0 and 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
- Edge (7, 2) (vertices 2 and 7): No triangle formed.
- Edge (7, 9) (vertices 9 and 7): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (8, 0) (vertices 0 and 8): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>
- Edge (8, 3) (vertices 3 and 8): No triangle formed.
- Edge (9, 1) (vertices 1 and 9): Forms a triangle with vertices 2 and 7. Triangles: <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 9>
- Edge (9, 2) (vertices 2 and 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 9>
- Edge (9, 7) (vertices 7 and 9): Forms a triangle with vertex 1. Triangle: <1, 7, 9>

The total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 7, 9>.
