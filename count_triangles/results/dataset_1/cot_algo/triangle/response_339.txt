Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0: 6, 7, 8, 9
1: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
2: 1, 4, 9
3: 1, 6
4: 2
5: 7, 8
6: 0, 3, 9
7: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
8: 0, 1, 5, 7
9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
```

Now, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

```
4: 2
5: 2
6: 3
0: 4
3: 4
2: 4
8: 4
1: 5
7: 5
9: 5
```

We will now count the triangles based on the degree-based ordering method:

1. (7, 8) shares connection 1 with 1 and connection 7 with 5 forming triangle <1, 7, 8>.
2. (1, 9) shares connection 1 with 1 and connection 9 with 2 forming triangle <1, 2, 9>.
3. (0, 6) shares connection 0 with 0 and connection 6 with 3 forming triangle <0, 3, 6>.
4. (0, 7) shares connection 0 with 0 and connection 7 with 1 forming triangle <0, 1, 7>.
5. (0, 8) shares connection 0 with 0 and connection 8 with 5 forming triangle <0, 5, 8>.
6. (0, 9) shares connection 0 with 0 and connection 9 with 2 forming triangle <0, 2, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
