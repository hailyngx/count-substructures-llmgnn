Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 -> 4 connections 
1 -> 3 connections
2 -> 2 connections
3 -> 3 connections
4 -> 1 connection
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 3 connections
7 -> 5 connections
8 -> 3 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge to count the number of triangles formed. 

Starting with the edge (0, 1):
- Since vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 1, we proceed.
- Shared connections between vertices 0 and 1 are with vertex 3 and vertex 8. 
- This forms triangles: <0, 3, 1> and <0, 8, 1>.

Moving on to the edge (0, 3):
- Proceeding with this edge:
- Shared connections between vertices 0 and 3 are with vertex 7.
- This forms a triangle: <0, 7, 3>.

Continuing with the remaining edges and applying the same method, we find the following triangles:
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 9, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<5, 9, 6>
<5, 9, 7>
<5, 9, 6>
<6, 7, 5>
<6, 9, 7>
<7, 9, 6>
<7, 9, 6>
<7, 9, 5>
<9, 8, 7>
<9, 8, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [14].
