Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method to the given graph and relabeling the vertices, we get the following sorted vertices with their degrees:
Vertices: 0(2), 1(2), 2(1), 3(3), 4(2), 5(2), 7(3), 9(1)

Using the given edges and the sorted vertices, we find the triangles as follows:

<0, 2, 3>
<3, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
