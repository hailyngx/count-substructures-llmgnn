Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:

Vertex 3 (Degree 1)
Vertex 7 (Degree 1)
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 4)
Vertex 2 (Degree 4)
Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)
Vertex 8 (Degree 4)
Vertex 5 (Degree 5)
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles as follows:

1. Vertex 3 (Degree 1) - Vertex 4 (Degree 4) - Vertex 5 (Degree 5) -> <3, 4, 5>
2. Vertex 7 (Degree 1) - Vertex 5 (Degree 5) - Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> <7, 5, 8>
3. Vertex 9 (Degree 2) - Vertex 6 (Degree 4) - Vertex 8 (Degree 4) -> <9, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
