Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7 and Node 9 have 0 connections.
- Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 have 1 connection each.
- Node 2 and Node 3 have 2 connections each.
- Node 0 and Node 5 have 4 connections each.
- Node 1 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will traverse the edges based on the new labeling to count the triangles.

We find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 3, 9>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
