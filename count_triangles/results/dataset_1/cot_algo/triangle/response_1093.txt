Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees:
Vertices: 1(1), 3(1), 9(1), 4(2), 7(2), 1(2), 6(3), 3(3), 9(3), 7(4)

Calculating the number of triangles:
Considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 2), sharing connections with vertices 4 and 5: Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (0, 4), sharing connections with vertices 1 and 6: Triangle <0, 4, 1>
- Edge (0, 5), no triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 6), no triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 9), no triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4), sharing connections with vertices 8 and 0: Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Edge (1, 8), no triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 0), sharing connections with vertices 4 and 5: Triangle <2, 0, 4>
- Edge (3, 5), no triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9), no triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 8), no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 0), no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3), no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6), no triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 7), no triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 0), no triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 8), no triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 2), no triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 5), no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 1), no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 2), no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 4), no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 6), no triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 7), no triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 0), no triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 3), no triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
