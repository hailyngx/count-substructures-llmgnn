Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 1: 0 connections  
Vertex 4: 0 connections  
Vertex 6: 0 connections  
Vertex 0: 4 connections  
Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertex 5: 2 connections  
Vertex 8: 2 connections  
Vertex 9: 2 connections  
Vertex 3: 4 connections  
Vertex 7: 4 connections  

Now, we will examine each edge starting from the ones between vertices with lower degrees:

1. Edge (4, 0): Vertices 4 and 0 share vertex 1 as a common connection.  
2. Edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.    
3. Edge (6, 9): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
4. Edge (0, 2): Vertices 0 and 2 do not share a common connection.  
5. Edge (0, 4): Already counted when processing edge (4, 0).  
6. Edge (0, 5): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.   
7. Edge (0, 7): Vertices 0 and 7 do not share a common connection.  
8. Edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 do not share a common connection.  
9. Edge (1, 4): Already counted when processing edge (4, 0).  
10. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
11. Edge (2, 0): Already counted when processing edge (0, 2).  
12. Edge (3, 1): Already counted when processing edge (1, 3).  
13. Edge (3, 7): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
14. Edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
15. Edge (3, 9): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
16. Edge (5, 4): Already counted when processing edge (4, 0).  
17. Edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
18. Edge (7, 0): Already counted when processing edge (0, 7).  
19. Edge (7, 1): Already counted when processing edge (1, 7).  
20. Edge (7, 3): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
21. Edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
22. Edge (8, 4): Already counted when processing edge (4, 0).  
23. Edge (9, 3): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  
24. Edge (9, 6): No triangles can be formed as the condition of lower degree for the lower labeled vertex is not satisfied.  

Thus, the total number of triangles is [1], and the unique triangle found is <0, 4, 1>.
