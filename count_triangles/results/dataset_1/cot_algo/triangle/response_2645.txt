Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes sorted in decreasing order of degrees: [3, 6, 2, 9, 6, 1, 1, 4, 4, 7]

Now, we relabel the nodes: 
Node 3 -> A
Node 6 -> B
Node 2 -> C
Node 9 -> D
Node 6 -> E
Node 1 -> F
Node 1 -> G
Node 4 -> H
Node 4 -> I
Node 7 -> J

The edges in the new labeling are:
(A, D) (A, C) (A, H) (A, E) (A, J) (A, I) (A, F) (B, F) (C, A) (D, A) (D, H) (E, A) (F, A) (F, G) (F, J) (G, F) (H, A) (H, D) (H, I) (I, A) (I, H) (I, J) (J, A) (J, H) (J, I)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we consider each edge and count the total number of triangles:
Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 8, 4>
<0, 7, 5>
<1, 0, 5>
<4, 0, 7>
