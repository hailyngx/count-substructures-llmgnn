Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each node:
- Node 0 has 1 connection
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 3 has 2 connections
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Node 6 has 4 connections
- Node 7 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 3 connections
- Node 9 has 1 connection

Sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, we have:
0, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, 7, 6, 2

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 0 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 5 -> 2
Node 9 -> 3
Node 3 -> 4
Node 4 -> 5
Node 8 -> 6
Node 7 -> 7
Node 6 -> 8
Node 2 -> 9

Now, we will iterate through the edges and count the triangles:
- (0, 5): None
- (1, 7): None
- (2, 3): None
- (2, 6): None
- (2, 7): <2, 3, 7>
- (3, 2): None
- (3, 6): None
- (4, 8): None
- (4, 9): None
- (5, 0): None
- (6, 2): None
- (6, 3): None
- (6, 8): None
- (7, 1): None
- (7, 2): None
- (8, 4): None
- (8, 6): None
- (9, 4): None

Total number of triangles: [1]

Triangles found: <2, 3, 7>
