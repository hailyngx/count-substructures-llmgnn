Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections in ascending order:
Node 8 is connected to 0 other nodes.
Nodes 3, 6, and 7 are connected to 1 other node.
Nodes 5 and 9 are connected to 2 other nodes.
Nodes 1 and 4 are connected to 3 other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes.
Node 0 is connected to 6 other nodes.

Based on the above ordering, we check each edge to count the number of triangles:
1. Edge (0, 1) with shared connections: [2, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
2. Edge (0, 2) with shared connections: [1, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 4) with shared connections: [1, 6]. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
4. Edge (0, 6) with shared connections: []. No triangle.
5. Edge (1, 0) with shared connections: [2, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
6. Edge (1, 2) with shared connections: [0, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
7. Edge (1, 4) with shared connections: [0, 9]. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
8. Edge (1, 9) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
9. Edge (2, 0) with shared connections: [1, 6]. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
10. Edge (2, 1) with shared connections: [0, 4]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
11. Edge (2, 3) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
12. Edge (2, 7) with shared connections: [3]. No triangle.
13. Edge (3, 2) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
14. Edge (3, 4) with shared connections: [2, 5]. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
15. Edge (3, 5) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
16. Edge (3, 7) with shared connections: [2]. No triangle.
17. Edge (4, 0) with shared connections: [1, 6]. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
18. Edge (4, 1) with shared connections: [0, 2]. Triangle <0, 1, 2>.
19. Edge (4, 3) with shared connections: [5]. No triangle.
20. Edge (4, 5) with shared connections: [3]. No triangle.
21. Edge (5, 3) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
22. Edge (5, 4) with shared connections: [3]. No triangle.
23. Edge (5, 9) with shared connections: [1]. No triangle.
24. Edge (6, 0) with shared connections: []. No triangle.
25. Edge (6, 9) with shared connections: [0]. No triangle.
26. Edge (7, 2) with shared connections: [3]. No triangle.
27. Edge (7, 3) with shared connections: [2]. No triangle.
28. Edge (9, 1) with shared connections: [4]. No triangle.
29. Edge (9, 5) with shared connections: [1]. No triangle.
30. Edge (9, 6) with shared connections: [0]. No triangle.

Total number of triangles found: [4]

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
