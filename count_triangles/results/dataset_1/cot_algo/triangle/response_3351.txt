Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the ordering based on the number of connections for each vertex:

Node 7: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 6

Applying the Degree-Based Ordering, we will check each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex.
