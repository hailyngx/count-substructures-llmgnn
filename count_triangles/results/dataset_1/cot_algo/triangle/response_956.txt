Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 

Vertex 1 - Degree 2
Vertex 5 - Degree 2
Vertex 7 - Degree 2
Vertex 9 - Degree 2
Vertex 0 - Degree 2
Vertex 2 - Degree 2
Vertex 8 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 3
Vertex 3 - Degree 5
Vertex 4 - Degree 8

Let's proceed to count the triangles:

For edge (0, 4):
0 and 4 share 2 common connections: 2, 3
Triangle 1: <0, 2, 3>

For edge (1, 7):
1 and 7 share 1 common connection: 4
No triangles are formed.

For edge (1, 9):
1 and 9 share 1 common connection: 6
No triangles are formed.

For edge (2, 4):
2 and 4 share 1 common connection: 0
No triangles are formed.

For edge (3, 4):
3 and 4 share 4 common connections: 0, 2, 7, 8
Triangles 2: <3, 0, 2>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 4>

For edge (3, 5):
3 and 5 do not share any connections.
No triangles are formed.

For edge (3, 6):
3 and 6 share 1 common connection: 9
No triangles are formed.

For edge (3, 8):
3 and 8 share 1 common connection: 4
No triangles are formed.

For edge (4, 0):
4 and 0 share 2 common connections: 2, 3
Triangle 3: <4, 0, 2>

For edge (4, 2):
4 and 2 share 1 common connection: 0
No triangles are formed.

For edge (4, 3):
This was already counted when processing edge (3, 4).

For edge (4, 7):
4 and 7 share 1 common connection: 1
No triangles are formed.

For edge (4, 8):
4 and 8 share 1 common connection: 3
No triangles are formed.

For edge (5, 3):
This was already counted when processing edge (3, 5).

For edge (6, 3):
This was already counted when processing edge (3, 6).

For edge (6, 9):
6 and 9 do not share any connections.
No triangles are formed.

For edge (7, 1):
This was already counted when processing edge (1, 7).

For edge (7, 4):
This was already counted when processing edge (4, 7).

For edge (8, 3):
This was already counted when processing edge (3, 8).

For edge (8, 4):
This was already counted when processing edge (4, 8).

For edge (9, 1):
This was already counted when processing edge (1, 9).

For edge (9, 6):
This was already counted when processing edge (6, 9).

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph. The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 3>, <3, 0, 2>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 8, 4>.
