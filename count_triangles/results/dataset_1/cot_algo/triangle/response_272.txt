Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 6 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
