Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 (degree 4), 1 (degree 3), 2 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 4 (degree 4), 5 (degree 2), 6 (degree 1), 7 (degree 5), 8 (degree 3), 9 (degree 2).

Now we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles: 
1. <0, 3, 7>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 5, 7>
4. <1, 4, 7>
5. <1, 4, 9>
6. <2, 1, 4>
7. <3, 0, 7>
8. <4, 7, 9>
9. <4, 1, 7>
10. <7, 0, 3>
11. <7, 0, 5>
12. <7, 3, 4>
13. <8, 0, 1>
14. <8, 0, 9>
15. <8, 1, 4>
16. <9, 4, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [16].
