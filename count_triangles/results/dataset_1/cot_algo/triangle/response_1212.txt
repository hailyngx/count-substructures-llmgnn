Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most. Here is the sorted list of vertices:
Vertices: 2, 6, 9, 0, 4, 8, 5, 1, 7, 3

Following the method mentioned in the question, the triangles can be counted by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge:

Triangles:
<1, 3, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<7, 4, 0>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 0>

Total number of triangles: [5]
