Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the relabeled graph is as follows:
- Node 6 (Degree 1)
- Node 8 (Degree 1)
- Node 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 4)
- Node 7 (Degree 5)
- Node 0 (Degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are 3 triangles in the graph, listed below:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <0, 2, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
