Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling:
Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 2 connections
Node 3 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 3 connections
Node 6 has 4 connections
Node 4 has 0 connections
Node 1 has 0 connections
Node 2 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 7 connections
Node 8 has 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.
The triangles are formed by the shared connections between two vertices of each edge.

Following the provided edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 6, 5>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<9, 8, 2>
<9, 8, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
