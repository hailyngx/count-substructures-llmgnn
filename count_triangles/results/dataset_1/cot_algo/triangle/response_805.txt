Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the ordering becomes: 

Vertices: 0, 8, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 7, 4, 9

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 has 0 connections, Vertex 4 has 3 connections. No triangles can be formed.
2. Edge (2, 9): Vertex 2 has 0 connections, Vertex 9 has 5 connections. No triangles can be formed.
3. Edge (3, 1): Vertex 3 has 0 connections, Vertex 1 has 3 connections. No triangles can be formed.
4. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 has 0 connections, Vertex 7 has 5 connections. No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 has 0 connections, Vertex 9 has 5 connections. No triangles can be formed.
6. Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has 3 connections, Vertex 3 has 0 connections. No triangles can be formed.
7. Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 has 3 connections, Vertex 7 has 5 connections. A triangle is formed with shared connection 4. This triangle is <4, 5, 7>.
8. Edge (7, 4): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, Vertex 4 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with shared connection 5. This triangle is <4, 5, 7>.
9. Edge (7, 5): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, Vertex 5 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with shared connection 4. This triangle is <4, 5, 7>.
10. Edge (7, 6): Vertex 7 has 5 connections, Vertex 6 has 0 connections. No triangles can be formed.
11. Edge (9, 1): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, Vertex 1 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with shared connection 7. This triangle is <1, 7, 9>.
12. Edge (9, 2): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, Vertex 2 has 0 connections. No triangles can be formed.
13. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, Vertex 5 has 3 connections. A triangle is formed with shared connection 7. This triangle is <5, 7, 9>.
14. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, Vertex 6 has 0 connections. No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 9 has 5 connections, Vertex 8 has 0 connections. No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <4, 5, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 9>
