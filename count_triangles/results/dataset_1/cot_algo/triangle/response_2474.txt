Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 1 --- 2
|     |     |
4     3     5
      |     |
      6     |
           / 
          7
           \
            9
```

By sorting the vertices based on their degrees: 

Nodes by degree:
0: 3
4: 2
7: 2
9: 1
3: 3
6: 2
2: 3
5: 2
1: 5

Re-labelling the nodes based on degrees: 
9: 0
7: 1
4: 2
6: 3
5: 4
2: 5
0: 6
3: 7
1: 8

Now, looking at the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 2> formed by nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Triangle <1, 2, 3> formed by nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Triangle <1, 2, 5> formed by nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Triangle <1, 3, 4> formed by nodes 1, 3, and 4.

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
