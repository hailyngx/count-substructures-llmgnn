Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 5 has 0 connections,
Vertices 7 and 9 have 1 connection each,
Vertices 1, 2, and 6 have 2 connections each,
Vertices 0 and 7 have 4 connections each, and
Vertices 3 and 4 have 5 connections each.

We will now count the triangles:
For edge (0, 3): 
Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 3, 4, 8, and 9. Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 0, 1, 4, and 6. They both have connections with vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 3, 4>.

For edge (0, 4): 
Vertices 0 and 4 already form a triangle with vertex 3.

For edge (0, 8): 
Vertex 8 has connections with vertices 0, 1, and 6. No triangle is formed.

For edge (0, 9): 
Vertex 9 has connections with vertices 0 and 4. No triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 3): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 6): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (1, 8): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (2, 4): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (2, 7): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (3, 4): 
Vertices 3 and 4 already form a triangle with vertex 0.

For edge (4, 9): 
No triangle is formed.

For edge (6, 8): 
No triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1] and the unique triangle found is <0, 3, 4>.
