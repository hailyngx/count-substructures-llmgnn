Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labeling of the vertices would be: 

0 -> 3 connections
1 -> 1 connection
2 -> 1 connection
3 -> 4 connections
4 -> 2 connections
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 2 connections
7 -> 2 connections
8 -> 6 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<6, 3, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
