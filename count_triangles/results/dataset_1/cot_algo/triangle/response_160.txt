Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of connections for each vertex:
- Vertex 1 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
- Vertex 4 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections.
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
- Vertex 8 has 4 connections.
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the number of connections:
- Vertex 3 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 1.
- Vertex 4 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 2.
- Vertex 6 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 3.
- Vertex 7 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 4.
- Vertex 9 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 5.
- Vertex 1 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 6.
- Vertex 5 (3 connections) becomes Vertex 7.
- Vertex 8 (4 connections) becomes Vertex 8.

We will now check the edges according to the new labels:

- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle: <6, 1, 8>.
- Edge (3, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle: <6, 5, 8>.
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) forms a triangle: <6, 5, 8>.
- Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle: <5, 8, 9>.
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 8) forms a triangle: <5, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4], and the unique triangles found are <6, 1, 8>, <6, 5, 8>, <5, 8, 9>.
