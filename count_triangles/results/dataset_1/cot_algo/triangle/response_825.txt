Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 - 8
- 2 - 4, 5, 6, 7
- 3 - 9
- 4 - 2, 9
- 5 - 2
- 6 - 2, 9
- 7 - 2, 9
- 8 - 0
- 9 - 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
0 (degree 1)
3, 5, 7, 8 (degree 1)
4, 6 (degree 2)
2, 9 (degree 4)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the triangles:
- (2, 4, 9)
- (2, 6, 9)
- (2, 7, 9)

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <2, 4, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>
