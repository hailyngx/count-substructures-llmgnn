Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 1: 7 connections
- Node 4: 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge to count the triangles.

Triangles:
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 9>

There are a total of [4] triangles in the given graph.
