Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a Degree-Based Ordering for the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices: (degree)
0: 2
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
4: 0
5: 5
6: 4
7: 1
8: 1
9: 5

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, the new labels are:
0 → 4
1 → 7
2 → 0
3 → 1
4 → 2
5 → 8
6 → 3
7 → 5
8 → 6
9 → 9

Now, let's list the edges in the same order according to their new labels:
(4, 8) (7, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (5, 8) (3, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (6, 9) (0, 2) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 6) (9, 8) (4, 5) (3, 5) (7, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9)

Next, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles:
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<3, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 6>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 7, 8>
