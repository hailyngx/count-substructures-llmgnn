Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are as follows:
Nodes: 7, 0, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 2, 9, 4

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Check shared connections of node 0 and 1. Shared connections: 8. Triangle: <0, 1, 8>.

2. Edge (0, 8): Since the lower label vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 8, we proceed. Check shared connections of node 0 and 8. Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <0, 8, 1>.

3. Edge (1, 3): Since the lower label vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 3, we proceed. Check shared connections of node 1 and 3. Shared connections: None.

4. Edge (1, 4): Since the lower label vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 4, we proceed. Check shared connections of node 1 and 4. Shared connections: 9. Triangle: <1, 4, 9>.
