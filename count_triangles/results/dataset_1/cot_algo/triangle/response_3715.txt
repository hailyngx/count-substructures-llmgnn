Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0 (degree 2)
- Node 1 (degree 1)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 4 (degree 2)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 5)

By examining the edges based on the degree-based ordering, we can count the triangles. 

Triangles:
- <2, 6, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 5>
- <2, 8, 7>
- <2, 8, 6>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <2, 7, 6>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <6, 8, 5>
- <7, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [16]
