Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 1 connection
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 5 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections

Now using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 < Vertex 4, shared connection with Vertex 2, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (1, 7): Vertex 1 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 3, forming triangle <1, 3, 7>.
3. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
4. Edge (2, 4): Vertex 2 < Vertex 4, shared connection with Vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
5. Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 < Vertex 8, no shared connection for a triangle.
6. Edge (3, 6): Vertex 3 < Vertex 6, no shared connection for a triangle.
7. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 3, 7>.
8. Edge (4, 0): Vertex 0 < Vertex 4, shared connection with Vertex 2, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
9. Edge (4, 2): Vertex 2 < Vertex 4, shared connection with Vertex 0, forming triangle <0, 2, 4>.
10. Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
11. Edge (5, 9): Vertex 5 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
12. Edge (6, 3): Vertex 3 < Vertex 6, no shared connection for a triangle.
13. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 6, 7>.
14. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
15. Edge (7, 1): Vertex 1 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 3, forming triangle <1, 3, 7>.
16. Edge (7, 3): Vertex 3 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 3, 7>.
17. Edge (7, 4): Vertex 4 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 7>.
18. Edge (7, 6): Vertex 6 < Vertex 7, shared connection with Vertex 3, forming triangle <3, 6, 7>.
19. Edge (8, 2): Vertex 2 < Vertex 8, no shared connection for a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 9): Vertex 8 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
21. Edge (9, 1): Vertex 1 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 5): Vertex 5 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
23. Edge (9, 6): Vertex 6 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
24. Edge (9, 8): Vertex 8 < Vertex 9, no shared connection for a triangle.
