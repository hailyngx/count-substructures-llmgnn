Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices based on the number of connections:
- Node 6 (Degree 1)
- Node 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 4 (Degree 2)
- Node 5 (Degree 2)
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 3)
- Node 2 (Degree 3)
- Node 9 (Degree 4)
- Node 0 (Degree 5)
- Node 8 (Degree 5)

Reordering the nodes:
- Node 6 now becomes Node 0
- Node 3 now becomes Node 1
- Node 4 now becomes Node 2
- Node 5 now becomes Node 3
- Node 1 now becomes Node 4
- Node 7 now becomes Node 5
- Node 2 now becomes Node 6
- Node 9 now becomes Node 7
- Node 0 now becomes Node 8
- Node 8 now becomes Node 9

Now, we can count the triangles. 

There are [10] triangles in this graph, and they are:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 9, 4>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 9, 5>
<1, 2, 4>
<3, 8, 6>
<5, 3, 9>
