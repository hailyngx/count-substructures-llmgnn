Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 8 -> 0 
Node 1 -> 1 
Node 0 -> 2 
Node 6 -> 3 
Node 4 -> 4 
Node 5 -> 5 
Node 9 -> 6 
Node 7 -> 7 
Node 2 -> 8 
Node 3 -> 9 

The list of edges becomes: 
(2, 9) (5, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7)  (9, 6)  (4, 5) (4, 7) (1, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and looking at each edge, we find the triangles:

- Triangle <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle <5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
