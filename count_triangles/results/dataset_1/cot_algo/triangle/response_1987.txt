Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
1. Node 5 (0 connections)
2. Node 1 (1 connection)
3. Node 6 (1 connection)
4. Node 9 (2 connections)
5. Node 4 (2 connections)
6. Node 5 (2 connections)
7. Node 2 (2 connections)
8. Node 7 (3 connections)
9. Node 0 (4 connections)
10. Node 3 (6 connections)

Now, let's count the triangles:
1. For edge (0, 2):
   - Shared connections: None
2. For edge (0, 3):
   - Shared connections: 8
   - Triangle: <0, 3, 8>
3. For edge (0, 8):
   - Shared connections: None
4. For edge (1, 9):
   - Shared connections: None
5. For edge (2, 7):
   - Shared connections: None
6. For edge (3, 4):
   - Shared connections: None
7. For edge (3, 7):
   - Shared connections: None
8. For edge (6, 4):
   - Shared connections: None
9. For edge (7, 8):
   - Shared connections: None
10. For edge (9, 1):
    - Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 8>
