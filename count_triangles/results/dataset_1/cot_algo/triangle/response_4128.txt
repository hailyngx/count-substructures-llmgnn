Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 has degree 0
- Node 5 has degree 0
- Node 7 has degree 0
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <2, 3, 8>
2. <2, 3, 6>
3. <2, 6, 8>
4. <1, 2, 8>
5. <1, 2, 6>
6. <1, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
