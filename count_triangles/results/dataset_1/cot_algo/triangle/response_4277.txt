Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling:

Node 5 (Degree 0)
Node 8 (Degree 0)
Node 2 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 2)
Node 7 (Degree 2)
Node 6 (Degree 2)
Node 1 (Degree 3)
Node 9 (Degree 3)
Node 0 (Degree 6)
Node 4 (Degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles by looking at the shared connections between nodes in the order of their labels:

1. Triangle: <0, 1, 9>
2. Triangle: <0, 1, 3>
3. Triangle: <0, 1, 7>
4. Triangle: <0, 1, 2>
5. Triangle: <1, 3, 9>
6. Triangle: <0, 4, 2>
7. Triangle: <0, 4, 6>
8. Triangle: <1, 7, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
