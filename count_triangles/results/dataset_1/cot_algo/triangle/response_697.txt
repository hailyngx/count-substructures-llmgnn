Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel the nodes as follows: 

Node 0 has 2 connections
Node 7 has 1 connection
Node 8 has 1 connection
Node 2 has 2 connections
Node 4 has 3 connections
Node 3 has 3 connections
Node 7 has 1 connection
Node 1 has 4 connections
Node 5 has 4 connections
Node 9 has 5 connections

The edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections are as follows:
(0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 5), (5, 9)

Now, let's count the triangles by checking for shared connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
