Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 8: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection
Nodes 1, 2, 4: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 5, 9: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now explore each edge to count the number of triangles in the graph.

Triangles:
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 9. Triangle = <0, 6, 9>
- Edge (0, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle = <1, 3, 5>
- Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 3 and 9. Triangle = <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 9>
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 1) has already been counted.
- Edge (3, 5) has already been counted.
- Edge (3, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 1. Triangle = <3, 7, 1>
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 1, 5. Triangle = <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 5>
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 1) has already been counted.
- Edge (5, 3) has already been counted.
- Edge (5, 9) has already been counted.
- Edge (6, 0) has already been counted.
- Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 0. Triangle = <6, 9, 0>
- Edge (7, 1) has already been counted.
- Edge (7, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 3) has already been counted.
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 3) has already been counted.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) has already been counted.
- Edge (9, 6) has already been counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10] and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 1>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 5>
