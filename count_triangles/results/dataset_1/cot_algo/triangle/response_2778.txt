Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has, from least to most connections. Then we relabel the vertices according to this order.

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections:
(1) - 1 connection
(9) - 1 connection
(0) - 2 connections
(5) - 2 connections
(6) - 2 connections
(4) - 3 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(8) - 3 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(3) - 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph by examining each edge:

- (1, 2) does not form a triangle
- (1, 3) does not form a triangle
- (1, 0) does not form a triangle
- (9, 7) does not form a triangle
- (0, 3) forms triangle <0, 2, 3>
- (0, 4) does not form a triangle
- (0, 7) does not form a triangle
- (5, 7) does not form a triangle
- (5, 2) does not form a triangle
- (6, 2) forms triangle <2, 4, 6>
- (6, 4) forms triangle <2, 4, 6>
- (4, 8) forms triangle <2, 4, 8>
- (7, 9) does not form a triangle
- (7, 0) forms triangle <0, 3, 7>
- (7, 5) does not form a triangle
- (2, 1) does not form a triangle
- (2, 5) does not form a triangle
- (2, 6) forms triangle <2, 4, 6>
- (2, 8) forms triangle <2, 4, 8>
- (3, 0) forms triangle <0, 2, 3>
- (3, 1) does not form a triangle
- (3, 8) forms triangle <2, 3, 8>
- (4, 0) does not form a triangle
- (4, 6) forms triangle <2, 4, 6>
- (4, 8) forms triangle <2, 4, 8>
- (8, 3) forms triangle <2, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 8>.
