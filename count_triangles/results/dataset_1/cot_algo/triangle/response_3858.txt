Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 3 has degree 1
Vertices 5 and 9 have degree 2
Vertices 4 and 7 have degree 3
Vertices 1 and 6 have degree 4
Vertices 2 and 8 have degree 5

Now we can go through each edge and count the triangles:
(0, 6) - No triangles
(0, 7) - No triangles
(1, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
(1, 4) - No triangles
(1, 6) - No triangles
(1, 7) - No triangles
(1, 8) - No triangles
(2, 1) - Triangle <1, 2, 4>
(2, 4) - No triangles
(2, 5) - No triangles
(2, 6) - Triangle <1, 2, 6>
(2, 8) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
(3, 6) - No triangles
(4, 1) - No triangles
(4, 2) - No triangles
(5, 2) - No triangles
(5, 8) - No triangles
(6, 0) - No triangles
(6, 1) - No triangles
(6, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 6>
(6, 3) - No triangles
(7, 0) - No triangles
(7, 1) - No triangles
(7, 8) - No triangles
(8, 1) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
(8, 2) - Triangle <1, 2, 8>
(8, 5) - No triangles
(8, 7) - No triangles
(8, 9) - No triangles
(9, 8) - No triangles

There are a total of [3] triangles in the given graph, which are <1, 2, 4>, <1, 2, 6>, and <1, 2, 8>.
