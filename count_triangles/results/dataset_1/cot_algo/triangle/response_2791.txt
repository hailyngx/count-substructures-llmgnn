Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, first sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 3 has 1 connection.
Vertex 1 and 7 have 1 connection each.
Vertex 4, 5, and 7 have 2 connections each.
Vertex 0 and 8 have 3 connections each.
Vertex 2 and 6 have 4 connections each.

We will now relabel the vertices based on the sorting:

Vertex 3 -> 0
Vertex 1 -> 1
Vertex 7 -> 2
Vertex 4 -> 3
Vertex 5 -> 4
Vertex 7 -> 5
Vertex 0 -> 6
Vertex 8 -> 7
Vertex 2 -> 8
Vertex 6 -> 9

Now, we will list the edges for which the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 2) -> Both have 3 connections.
(0, 6) -> Vertex 6 has more connections.
(1, 5) -> Both have 2 connections.
(2, 0) -> Both have 4 connections.
(2, 6) -> Both have 4 connections.
(3, 8) -> Both have 1 connection.
(4, 8) -> Both have 2 connections.
(5, 1) -> Both have 2 connections.
(5, 6) -> Vertex 5 has fewer connections (2 < 4) so we proceed.
(6, 0) -> Both have 3 connections.
(6, 2) -> Both have 4 connections.
(6, 5) -> Vertex 5 has fewer connections (2 < 4) so we proceed.
(6, 7) -> Vertex 2 has fewer connections (2 < 3) so we proceed.
(7, 6) -> Vertex 2 has fewer connections (2 < 4) so we proceed.
(8, 3) -> Both have 1 connection.
(8, 4) -> Both have 2 connections.

Now, we identify the triangles formed by shared connections:

<0, 2, 6>
<4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
