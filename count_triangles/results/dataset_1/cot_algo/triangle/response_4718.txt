Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

0: 2 connections
1: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
9: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
8: 6 connections
2: 4 connections

We relabel the vertices with their sorted order: 
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
4 -> 2
7 -> 3
5 -> 4
6 -> 5
9 -> 6
3 -> 7
8 -> 8
2 -> 9

After relabeling, the edges are: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5)

Now, we count the triangles:

- Triangle with vertices <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 4, 6>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 4, 3>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 5, 3>
- Triangle with vertices <1, 5, 8>
- Triangle with vertices <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle with vertices <2, 7, 5>
- Triangle with vertices <3, 9, 5>
- Triangle with vertices <3, 9, 8>
- Triangle with vertices <4, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
