Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

0 (degree 1)  
1 (degree 1)  
2 (degree 1)  
3 (degree 1)  
6 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 2)  
8 (degree 3)  
1 (degree 3)  
4 (degree 4)  
9 (degree 5)  

Therefore, we will only consider the edges in the following order: (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 5), (7, 4), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 4), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7).

By following the degree-based ordering method and counting the triangles, we find that the total number of triangles is [6].

The unique triangles found are:  
<0, 4, 9>  
<1, 4, 9>  
<4, 7, 8>  
<4, 7, 9>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<7, 8, 9>
