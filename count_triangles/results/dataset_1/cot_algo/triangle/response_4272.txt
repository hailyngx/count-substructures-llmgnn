Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 3, 6, 7, 1, 2, 7, 4, 6, 8, 9
Now, we relabel the vertices:
3 -> 0, 6 -> 1, 7 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 7 -> 5, 4 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 8 -> 8, 9 -> 9 

Next, we list the edges where the lower-labeled vertex has fewer connections:
Edges: (3, 9) (6, 9) (7, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8)

Now, we count the number of triangles:
Triangles: <1, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [1].
