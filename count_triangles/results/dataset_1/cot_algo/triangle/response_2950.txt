Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, the new labels for each node will be:
Nodes: 0, 1, 8, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles:
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 4, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <4, 7, 9>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
