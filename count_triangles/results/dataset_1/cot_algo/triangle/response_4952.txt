Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 4, 2, 8, 7, 3

Edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (5, 7), (6, 2), (7, 9)

Triangles found:
<0, 3, 1>, <2, 3, 4>
