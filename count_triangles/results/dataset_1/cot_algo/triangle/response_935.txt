Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Now, we will relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:

Node 1: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections

Next, we will go through the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 6): Check for shared connections between 0 and 6. No triangle formed.
2. Edge (2, 5): Check for shared connections between 2 and 5. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (2, 8): Check for shared connections between 2 and 8. No triangle formed.
4. Edge (3, 4): Check for shared connections between 3 and 4. Triangle formed with node 5. <3, 4, 5>
5. Edge (3, 6): Check for shared connections between 3 and 6. No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 7): Check for shared connections between 3 and 7. No triangle formed.
7. Edge (4, 3): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
8. Edge (4, 5): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
9. Edge (4, 8): Check for shared connections between 4 and 8. No triangle formed.
10. Edge (4, 9): Check for shared connections between 4 and 9. No triangle formed.
11. Edge (5, 2): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
12. Edge (5, 4): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
13. Edge (5, 7): Check for shared connections between 5 and 7. No triangle formed.
14. Edge (6, 0): Check for shared connections between 6 and 0. No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 3): Check for shared connections between 6 and 3. No triangle formed.
16. Edge (7, 3): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
17. Edge (7, 5): Check for shared connections between 7 and 5. No triangle formed.
18. Edge (8, 2): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
19. Edge (8, 4): Skip because the vertex with the lower label doesn't have fewer connections.
20. Edge (9, 4): Check for shared connections between 9 and 4. No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [1]
