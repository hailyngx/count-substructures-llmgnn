Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves relabeling the vertices based on their number of connections from least to most. 

The sorted list of vertices with their connections is as follows:
0: 2
5: 2
1: 3
7: 4
8: 4
3: 5
4: 5
6: 6
2: 6
9: 6

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed by checking for shared connections:

(0, 6): <0, 6, 9>
(0, 9): <0, 6, 9>
(1, 2): 
(1, 6): 
(1, 8): 
(2, 1): 
(2, 4): 
(2, 7): 
(2, 8): <2, 8, 9>
(2, 9): 
(3, 4): 
(3, 6): <3, 4, 6>
(3, 7): <3, 4, 7>
(3, 8): <3, 4, 8>
(3, 9): <3, 4, 9>
(4, 2): 
(4, 3): 
(4, 6): <3, 4, 6>
(4, 7): <3, 4, 7>
(4, 9): <3, 4, 9>
(5, 6): 
(5, 8): 
(6, 0): <0, 6, 9>
(6, 1): 
(6, 3): <3, 4, 6>
(6, 4): <3, 4, 6>
(6, 5): 
(7, 2): 
(7, 3): <3, 4, 7>
(7, 4): <3, 4, 7>
(7, 9): 
(8, 1): 
(8, 2): <2, 8, 9>
(8, 3): <3, 4, 8>
(8, 5): 
(8, 9): 
(9, 0): <0, 6, 9>
(9, 2): 
(9, 3): <3, 4, 9>
(9, 4): <3, 4, 9>
(9, 7): 

Number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 9>
