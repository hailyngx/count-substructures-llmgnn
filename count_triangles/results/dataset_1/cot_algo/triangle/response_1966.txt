Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted by their number of connections from least to most as follows: 

Vertices: 2, 7, 6, 5, 2, 7, 8, 2, 4, 0

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

- Edge (0, 1): Forms triangles with 4 and 5: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with 1: <0, 1, 4>
- Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with 1: <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Forms a triangle with 4: <1, 3, 4>
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, and <1, 3, 4>.
