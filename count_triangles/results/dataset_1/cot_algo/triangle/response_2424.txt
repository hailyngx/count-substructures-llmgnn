Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections in ascending order:
(1) - 1 connection
(0, 9) - 2 connections
(7) - 3 connections
(5) - 3 connections
(6) - 0 connections
(8) - 4 connections
(4) - 7 connections
(2, 3) - 7 connections

Triangles found:
[18]

Unique triangles:
