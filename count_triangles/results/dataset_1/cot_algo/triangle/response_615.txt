Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 7 is not connected to any other vertices.

Vertices sorted by degree:
7 (Degree: 0)
6 (Degree: 1)
9 (Degree: 1)
2 (Degree: 1)
4 (Degree: 2)
8 (Degree: 2)
3 (Degree: 2)
1 (Degree: 3)
0 (Degree: 4)
5 (Degree: 5)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
7 (Degree: 0) -> Vertex 0
6 (Degree: 1) -> Vertex 1
9 (Degree: 1) -> Vertex 2
2 (Degree: 1) -> Vertex 3
4 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 4
8 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 5
3 (Degree: 2) -> Vertex 6
1 (Degree: 3) -> Vertex 7
0 (Degree: 4) -> Vertex 8
5 (Degree: 5) -> Vertex 9

Now, we will analyze each edge to count the triangles:
(0, 1):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 3 and share a connection with vertex 5.
Triangle: <0, 1, 5>

(0, 2):
- Vertex 0 has a degree of 4 and vertex 2 has a degree of 1, so we do not count a triangle.

(0, 5):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 5 and share a connection with vertices 1 and 2.
Triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>

(0, 8):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 4 and share a connection with vertex 3.
Triangle: <0, 3, 8>

(1, 0):
- Already counted.

(1, 4):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 3 and share a connection with vertex 5.
Triangle: <1, 4, 5>

(1, 5):
- Already counted.

(2, 0):
- Already analyzed.

(3, 5):
- Vertex 3 has a degree of 2 and vertex 5 has a degree of 5, so we do not count a triangle.

(3, 8):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 4 and share a connection with vertex 0.
Triangle: <3, 0, 8>

(4, 1):
- Already counted.

(4, 6):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 2 and share a connection with vertex 5.
Triangle: <4, 6, 5>

(5, 0):
- Already counted.

(5, 1):
- Already counted.

(5, 3):
- Vertex 5 has a degree of 5 and vertex 3 has a degree of 2, so we do not count a triangle.

(5, 9):
- Both vertices have a degree less than 2 and share a connection with vertex 3.
Triangle: <5, 9, 3>

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 5>
