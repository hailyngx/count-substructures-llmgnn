Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's rearrange the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes sorted by degree: 2, 5, 8, 9, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 0

Now, let's go through the edges one by one and count the triangles formed:
For the edge (0, 6):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 7
- Nodes 7 and 9 are shared connections, forming a triangle.
Triangles counted: <0, 7, 9>

For the edge (0, 7):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 6, 8, 9
- Node 7 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 is the shared connection, forming a triangle.
Triangles counted: <0, 6, 7>

For the edge (0, 8):
No triangles formed.

For the edge (0, 9):
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 6, 7, 8
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 3, 4
- Node 3 is the shared connection, forming a triangle.
Triangles counted: <0, 3, 9>

For the edge (1, 3):
No triangles formed.

For the edge (1, 5):
No triangles formed.

For the edge (1, 6):
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 5, 6
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 7
- Node 3 is the shared connection, forming a triangle.
Triangles counted: <1, 3, 6>

For the edge (2, 7):
