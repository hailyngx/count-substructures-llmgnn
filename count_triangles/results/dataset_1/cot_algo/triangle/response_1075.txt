Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the new ordering of the nodes is: 

Node 0 : 2 connections
Node 2 : 1 connection
Node 4 : 4 connections
Node 3 : 3 connections
Node 6 : 2 connections
Node 1 : 5 connections
Node 7 : 4 connections
Node 5 : 4 connections
Node 8 : 5 connections
Node 9 : 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now find the number of triangles in the graph:

We will check each edge considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Count of triangles: [19]
