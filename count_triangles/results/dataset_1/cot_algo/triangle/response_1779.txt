Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degree:

Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 2 is not present in the edges list
Vertex 3 has degree 5
Vertex 4 has degree 2
Vertex 5 has degree 6
Vertex 6 has degree 2
Vertex 7 has degree 5
Vertex 8 has degree 2
Vertex 9 has degree 3

Next, we relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 is relabeled as 2
Vertex 1 is relabeled as 3
Vertex 2 is not present
Vertex 3 is relabeled as 4
Vertex 4 is relabeled as 5
Vertex 5 is relabeled as 6
Vertex 6 is relabeled as 7
Vertex 7 is relabeled as 8
Vertex 8 is relabeled as 9
Vertex 9 is relabeled as 10

Now, we will count the number of triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices with lower labels on each edge:

We observe that there are 7 triangles in total.

Output: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>
