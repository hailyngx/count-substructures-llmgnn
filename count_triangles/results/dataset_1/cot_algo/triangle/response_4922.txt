Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:
1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:  
Vertex 9 has 1 connection  
Vertices 1, 5 have 2 connections  
Vertices 7, 4 have 3 connections  
Vertices 0, 3 have 4 connections  
Vertices 2 has 5 connections  
Vertex 6 has 6 connections  
Vertices 8 has 7 connections  

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:  
Vertex 9 -> 1  
Vertices 1, 5 -> 2  
Vertices 7, 4 -> 3  
Vertices 0, 3 -> 4  
Vertex 2 -> 5  
Vertex 6 -> 6  
Vertex 8 -> 7  

3. Proceed with each edge starting from the vertex with lower label and count triangles.  

The triangles are:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<2, 3, 8>  
<2, 4, 6>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
