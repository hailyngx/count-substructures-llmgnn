Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: <0, 6, 9, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 7, 8>.

Now, we will examine each edge based on the new labels to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 has 3 connections (2, 3, 1) and vertex 1 has 4 connections (3, 4, 6, 7). 
   Shared connections between vertices 0 and 1 are (3). 
   Therefore, <0, 1, 3> is a triangle.

2. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 has 3 connections (1, 3, 2) and vertex 2 has 3 connections (3, 6, 1).
   Shared connections between vertices 0 and 2 are (1, 3). 
   Therefore, <0, 2, 1> is a triangle.

... (similar steps for all edges) ...

Total number of triangles: [15]
