Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
- Node 7 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 0, 4, and 8 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 1 and 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 4 connections each.
- Node 5 has 5 connections.
- Node 9 has 7 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze each edge to count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 3): Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.
- Edge (1, 6): Triangle formed: <1, 6, 2>.
- Edge (1, 9): Triangle formed: <1, 9, 0>.
- Edge (2, 3): Triangle formed: <2, 3, 1>.
- Edge (2, 6): Triangle formed: <2, 6, 1>.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 1): Triangle formed: <3, 1, 6>.
- Edge (3, 2): Triangle formed: <3, 2, 6>.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9): Triangle formed: <3, 9, 1>.
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (4, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 3): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Triangle formed: <5, 6, 1>.
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 9): Triangle formed: <5, 9, 1>.
- Edge (6, 1): Triangle formed: <6, 1, 3>.
- Edge (6, 2): Triangle formed: <6, 2, 3>.
- Edge (6, 5): Triangle formed: <6, 5, 1>.
- Edge (6, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 0): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 1): Triangle formed: <9, 1, 6>.
- Edge (9, 3): Triangle formed: <9, 3, 1>.
- Edge (9, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 5): Triangle formed: <9, 5, 6>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
