Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method for counting triangles involves first sorting the nodes by their degree. Then, we relabel the nodes based on their degrees and proceed to count triangles efficiently.

Here are the nodes with their degrees:
(0: 5), (1: 6), (2: 2), (3: 5), (4: 2), (5: 1), (6: 5), (7: 2), (8: 5), (9: 3)

Based on the degrees, the relabeled nodes are:
(2, 4, 5, 7), (0, 3, 6, 8, 9), (1)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the edges by specifically looking at edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 2>
<6, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [11]
