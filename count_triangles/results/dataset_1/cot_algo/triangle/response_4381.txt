Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
Node 0 (Degree 3)
Node 1 (Degree 1)
Node 5 (Degree 2)
Node 8 (Degree 2)
Node 3 (Degree 4)
Node 6 (Degree 5)
Node 9 (Degree 5)
Node 7 (Degree 5)
Node 2 (Degree 6)
Node 4 (Degree 6)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 2): Node 0 (Degree 3) is lower labeled than Node 2 (Degree 6). They share Node 6 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 4): Node 0 (Degree 3) is lower labeled than Node 4 (Degree 6). They share Node 6 as a common neighbor. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): Node 0 (Degree 3) is lower labeled than Node 6 (Degree 5). They share Node 2 and Node 4 as common neighbors. Triangles formed: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 4, 6>
- Remaining edges do not satisfy the condition (lower labeled vertex having fewer connections), so no additional triangles are formed from them.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <0, 4, 6>.
