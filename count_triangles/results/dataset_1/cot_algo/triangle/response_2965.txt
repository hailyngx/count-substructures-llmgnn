Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 7: 1 connection (connected to node 7)  
Node 0: 4 connections (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7)  
Node 5: 3 connections (connected to nodes 1, 6, 8)  
Node 8: 2 connections (connected to nodes 5, 6)  
Node 4: 3 connections (connected to nodes 0, 2, 6)  
Node 1: 4 connections (connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6)  
Node 9: 2 connections (connected to nodes 2, 6)  
Node 6: 5 connections (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8)  
Node 2: 4 connections (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with node 2 -> <0, 1, 2>  
2. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with nodes 1, 4, and 6 -> <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>  
3. Edge (0, 4): Shared connection with node 6 -> <0, 2, 4>  
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangles  
5. Edge (1, 2): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 4 -> <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 0>  
6. Edge (1, 5): Shared connection with node 6 -> <1, 5, 6>  
7. Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 -> <0, 1, 2>, <1, 6, 0>  
8. Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with node 6 -> <0, 2, 4>  
9. Edge (2, 6): Shared connections with nodes 0, 1, and 4 -> <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 4>  
10. Edge (2, 9): No triangles  
11. Edge (4, 6): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 2 -> <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 6>  
12. Edge (5, 6): Shared connection with node 1 -> <1, 5, 6>  
13. Edge (5, 8): No triangles  
14. Edge (6, 8): Shared connection with node 5 -> <5, 6, 8>  
15. Edge (6, 9): No triangles  

Total number of triangles: [14]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 6, 0>, <2, 4, 6>, <5, 6, 8>
