Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Node 3 has 1 connection
- Nodes 4, 6, and 7 have 2 connections each
- Nodes 5 and 8 have 3 connections each
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 connections each
- Node 2 has 5 connections

Now, let's relabel the nodes accordingly:
- Node 3 -> Node 0
- Nodes 4, 6, and 7 -> Nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Nodes 5 and 8 -> Nodes 4 and 5
- Nodes 1 and 9 -> Nodes 6 and 7
- Node 2 -> Node 8

Now, we will analyze each edge based on the labeling to count the triangles:
- (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 4: <0, 1, 4>
- (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6): No triangles
- (1, 6) forms a triangle with node 4: <1, 4, 6>
- (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8): No triangles
- (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 6): No triangles
- (2, 5) forms a triangle with node 8: <2, 5, 8>
- (2, 7), (5, 7): No triangles
- (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7): No triangles
- (6, 8), (7, 8): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 4>, <2, 5, 8>
