Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Nodes 2, 6, and 9 have 2 connections each.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Nodes 7 and 5 have 4 connections each.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.

Now, we analyze the edges in the order specified:

- Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share a connection with node 5. Therefore, triangle <0, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 share connections with nodes 3 and 7. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 share connections with nodes 2 and 7. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 2, 5> and <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (0, 6): Node 0 and 6 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 8): Nodes 0 and 8 share connections with nodes 1, 7, and 6. Therefore, three triangles are found: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 8>, and <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 do not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 5): Nodes 2 and 5 share a connection with node 0. Therefore, triangle <0, 2, 5> is found.
- Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 share a connection with nodes 0 and 7. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (3, 7): Nodes 3 and 7 share connections with nodes 4 and 0. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 share connections with nodes 0 and 3. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 3, 4> and <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 share a connection with node 5. Therefore, triangle <4, 5, 9> is found.
- Edge (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 share connections with nodes 0 and 4. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 4, 5> and <0, 5, 7>.
- Edge (5, 9): Nodes 5 and 9 share a connection with node 4. Therefore, triangle <4, 5, 9> is found.
- Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 share connections with node 0. Therefore, triangle <0, 6, 8> is found.
- Edge (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 share connections with nodes 0 and 5. Therefore, two triangles are found: <0, 5, 7> and <0, 7, 8>.
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
