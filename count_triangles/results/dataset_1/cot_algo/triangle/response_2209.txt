Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we check each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 do not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 8): Node 0 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 form a triangle with shared connection at Node 7. Triangle: <2, 6, 7>.
7. Edge (2, 9): Node 2 and Node 9 form a triangle with shared connection at Node 7. Triangle: <2, 9, 7>.
8. Edge (3, 4): Node 3 and Node 4 do not form a triangle.
9. Edge (3, 7): Node 3 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
10. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 and Node 5 do not form a triangle.
11. Edge (6, 7): Node 6 and Node 7 do not form a triangle.
12. Edge (7, 1): Node 7 and Node 1 do not form a triangle.
13. Edge (7, 3): Node 7 and Node 3 do not form a triangle.
14. Edge (7, 4): Node 7 and Node 4 form a triangle with shared connection at Node 1. Triangle: <7, 4, 1>.
15. Edge (7, 6): Node 7 and Node 6 do not form a triangle.
16. Edge (9, 8): Node 9 and Node 8 do not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
