Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes and their corresponding connections:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 2: 2
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 4
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 6: 10

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

- For edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 don't share any connection, so no triangle.
- For edge (1, 2): Node 1 and Node 2 don't share any connection, so no triangle.
- For edge (1, 3): Node 1 and Node 3 share Node 8, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
- For edge (1, 8): Node 1 and Node 8 don't share any connection, so no triangle.
- For edge (2, 1): (Already counted)
- For edge (3, 1): (Already counted)
- For edge (3, 5): Node 3 and Node 5 share Node 7, forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- For edge (3, 6): Node 3 and Node 6 share Nodes 7 and 8, forming a triangle <3, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 8>.
- For edge (3, 7): (Already counted)
- For edge (4, 0): (Already counted)
- For edge (5, 3): (Already counted)
- For edge (5, 7): (Already counted)
- For edge (6, 3): (Already counted)
- For edge (6, 7): (Already counted)
- For edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 share Node 1, forming a triangle <6, 8, 1>.
- For edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 share Node 7, forming a triangle <6, 9, 7>.
- For edge (7, 5): (Already counted)
- For edge (7, 6): (Already counted)
- For edge (7, 9): (Already counted)
- For edge (8, 1): (Already counted)
- For edge (8, 6): (Already counted)
- For edge (9, 6): (Already counted)
- For edge (9, 7): (Already counted)

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 8>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 9, 7>.
