Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices with their respective degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 4
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 4
- Vertex 8: degree 4

Now, we perform the Degree-Based Ordering:
- Relabel vertex 1 to 0
- Relabel vertex 4 to 1
- Relabel vertex 6 to 2
- Relabel vertex 3 to 3
- Relabel vertex 0 to 4
- Relabel vertex 2 to 5
- Relabel vertex 8 to 6
- Relabel vertex 7 to 7

Now, with the new ordering, the edges are:
(4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 6) (0, 2) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 5)

Now, we count the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle <0, 4, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
