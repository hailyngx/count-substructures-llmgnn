Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:

0 -> 5 connections
1 -> 4 connections
2 -> 4 connections
3 -> 4 connections
4 -> 6 connections
5 -> 4 connections
6 -> 5 connections
7 -> 4 connections
8 -> 3 connections
9 -> 4 connections

Now, looking at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the following triangles:

<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 6, 0>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 3>
<1, 9, 6>
<2, 4, 0>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<2, 9, 1>
<3, 0, 4>
<3, 5, 1>
<3, 9, 1>
<4, 0, 6>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 7, 4>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 4, 6>
<9, 1, 3>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 3, 5>
<9, 6, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [31].
