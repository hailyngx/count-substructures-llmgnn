Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and relabeling the vertices accordingly.

After relabeling the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0 has degree 0
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Considering the edges in the graph, we can count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method. The triangles found are:

<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
