Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Edge (0, 6) forms triangles with nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9. (4 triangles in total)
- Edge (0, 7) forms triangles with nodes 1, 4, and 9. (3 triangles in total)
- Edge (0, 8) forms 1 triangle with nodes 1 and 4.
- Edge (1, 4) forms no triangle.
- Edge (1, 9) forms no triangle.
- Edge (2, 3) forms no triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) forms 1 triangle with nodes 7 and 8.
- Edge (3, 2) forms no triangle.
- Edge (3, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (4, 1) forms 1 triangle with nodes 0 and 9.
- Edge (4, 5) forms no triangle.
- Edge (4, 7) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 3) forms no triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) forms 1 triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
- Edge (6, 0) forms no triangle.
- Edge (6, 2) forms 1 triangle with nodes 7 and 8.
- Edge (6, 7) forms 2 triangles with nodes 0, 8, and 9. (1 triangle in total)
- Edge (6, 8) forms 1 triangle with nodes 0 and 7.
- Edge (6, 9) forms no triangle.
- Edge (7, 0) forms 2 triangles with nodes 1, 8, and 9. (1 triangle in total)
- Edge (7, 4) forms no triangle.
- Edge (7, 6) forms no triangle.
- Edge (8, 0) forms 1 triangle with nodes 1 and 4.
- Edge (8, 6) forms no triangle.
- Edge (9, 1) forms no triangle.
- Edge (9, 6) forms no triangle.

Therefore, there are a total of [12] triangles in the given graph. 
Unique triangles found are <0, 7, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <5, 0, 7>, and <0, 6, 8>.
