Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree from least to most connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Nodes: 
0 - Degree 1
3 - Degree 1
5 - Degree 1
9 - Degree 1
1 - Degree 3
4 - Degree 4
7 - Degree 5
6 - Degree 6
2 - Degree 7
8 - Degree 7 

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now look at the edges in the order specified: 

1. (0, 7) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 0 has fewer connections.
2. (1, 2) - Forms a triangle: <1, 2, 8> 
3. (1, 3) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 1 has more connections.
4. (1, 7) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 1 has more connections.
5. (2, 1) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 1 has fewer connections.
6. (2, 4) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 2 has fewer connections.
7. (2, 5) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 2 has fewer connections.
8. (2, 6) - Forms a triangle: <2, 6, 9>
9. (2, 8) - Forms a triangle: <1, 2, 8>
10. (3, 1) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 1 has more connections.
11. (4, 2) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 2 has more connections.
12. (4, 6) - Forms a triangle: <4, 6, 8>
13. (4, 8) - Forms a triangle: <1, 2, 8>
14. (5, 2) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 2 has more connections.
15. (5, 9) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 5 has more connections.
16. (6, 2) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 2 has more connections.
17. (6, 4) - Forms a triangle: <4, 6, 8>
18. (6, 7) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
19. (6, 8) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 8>
20. (6, 9) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 9 has more connections.
21. (7, 0) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 0 has more connections.
22. (7, 1) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 1 has more connections.
23. (7, 6) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
24. (7, 8) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 8>
25. (7, 9) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 9 has more connections.
26. (8, 2) - Forms a triangle: <1, 2, 8>
27. (8, 4) - Forms a triangle: <4, 6, 8>
28. (8, 6) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 8>
29. (8, 7) - Forms a triangle: <1, 6, 7>
30. (9, 5) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 5 has more connections.
31. (9, 6) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 6 has more connections.
32. (9, 7) - Ignored because the lower labeled vertex 7 has more connections.

The total number of triangles is [7].
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>
