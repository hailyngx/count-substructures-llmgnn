Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: (degree)
1: 2
4: 2
7: 2
9: 2
0: 4
3: 4
6: 4
5: 5
8: 5
2: 6

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 0): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (2, 6): Shared connections with 0 and 3 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (2, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (3, 2): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (3, 6): Shared connections with 2 -> Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (4, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 3): Shared connections with 6 -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 6): Shared connections with 3 -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed
- Edge (6, 0): Shared connections with 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (6, 2): Shared connections with 0 and 3 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>
- Edge (6, 3): Shared connections with 5 -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (6, 5): Shared connections with 3 -> Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Edge (7, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 2): No triangles formed
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed

Total number of triangles: [3]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 6>
