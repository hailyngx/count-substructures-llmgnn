Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees, then relabeling them accordingly.

The degrees of the vertices in this graph are:
- Vertex 0: degree 5
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 4
- Vertex 4: degree 3
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 5
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 1

The sorted vertices based on degrees are: 9, 1, 4, 5, 8, 3, 6, 0, 7

Now, we go through each edge in the graph based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections to count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 3): Shared connections: 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
2. Edge (0, 5): Shared connections: 3. Triangle: <0, 3, 5>
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (0, 7): Shared connections: 5. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
5. Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (3, 5): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <3, 0, 5>
9. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <3, 0, 7>
10. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (4, 7): Shared connections: 1. Triangle: <4, 1, 7>
13. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (6, 7): Shared connections: 0. Triangle: <6, 0, 7>
16. Edge (7, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 7>, <3, 0, 5>, <3, 0, 7>.
