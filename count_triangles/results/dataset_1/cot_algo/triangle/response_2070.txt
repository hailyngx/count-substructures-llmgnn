Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 2 has 1 connection.  
Vertices 1, 5, and 8 have 2 connections.  
Vertices 4 and 8 have 3 connections.  
Vertices 0 and 7 have 4 connections.  
Vertices 3 and 9 have 5 connections.  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will iterate through the edges and count the number of triangles:

Triangles found:  
<0, 4, 6>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<3, 4, 6>  
<3, 4, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [4]
