Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly.

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is:
0: 1 connection (degree 1)
6: 0 connections (degree 0)
2: 2 connections (degree 2)
5: 2 connections (degree 2)
4: 3 connections (degree 3)
3: 3 connections (degree 3)
1: 4 connections (degree 4)
9: 4 connections (degree 4)
8: 5 connections (degree 5)
7: 4 connections (degree 4)

Now, we will count the triangles. Following the instructions, we start with the edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [9].

The unique triangles found are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 7, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 7, 4>
