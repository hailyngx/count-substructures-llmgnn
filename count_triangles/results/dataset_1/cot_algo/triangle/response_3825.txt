Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 3 connections
- Vertex 4: 2 connections
- Vertex 5: 1 connection
- Vertex 7: 2 connections
- Vertex 9: 3 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 3 connections
- Vertex 2: 5 connections
- Vertex 8: 5 connections

Now, we will count the triangles formed:
- For edge (0, 2): 
  - Shared connections: 8
  - Triangle: <0, 2, 8>

- For edge (0, 6): 
  - Shared connections: None
  
- For edge (0, 8): 
  - Shared connections: 2, 4
  - Triangle: <0, 4, 8>

- For edge (1, 2): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (1, 3): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (1, 6): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (2, 7): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (2, 9): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (3, 4): 
  - Shared connections: 8
  - Triangle: <3, 4, 8>

- For edge (3, 5): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (4, 8): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (6, 9): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (7, 8): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (8, 7): 
  - Shared connections: None

- For edge (9, 6): 
  - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <3, 4, 8>.
