Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 
Nodes: 8, 0, 4, 9, 2, 1, 5, 7, 3, 6

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 2 shares connections with nodes 3.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>.

2. Edge (0, 3):
   - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 1, 2, 5, 6.
   - Triangles formed: <0, 3, 2>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>.

3. Edge (0, 4):
   - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 2, 3, 8.
   - Node 4 shares connections with nodes 1.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 4, 1>.

4. Edge (0, 8):
   - Node 0 shares connections with nodes 2, 3, 4.
   - Node 8 shares connections with nodes 6.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 8, 6>.

5. Edge (1, 3):
   - Node 1 shares connections with nodes 4, 5, 6.
   - Node 3 shares connections with nodes 0, 2, 5, 6.
   - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 3>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 8, 6>
