Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 0 has 6 connections.

Now we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

Node 7 (degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 2 (degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 8 (degree 1) -> Node 2
Node 9 (degree 1) -> Node 3
Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 4
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 5
Node 3 (degree 2) -> Node 6
Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 7
Node 6 (degree 5) -> Node 8
Node 0 (degree 6) -> Node 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles:

Nodes 7-4-5 form a triangle: <7, 4, 5>
Nodes 7-4-1 form a triangle: <7, 4, 1>
Nodes 7-4-0 form a triangle: <7, 4, 0>
Nodes 7-1-5 form a triangle: <7, 1, 5>
Nodes 7-1-0 form a triangle: <7, 1, 0>
Nodes 4-1-5 form a triangle: <4, 1, 5>
Nodes 4-1-0 form a triangle: <4, 1, 0>
Nodes 4-5-0 form a triangle: <4, 5, 0>
Nodes 1-5-0 form a triangle: <1, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
