Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
- Node 5 has 1 connection
- Nodes 2, 9 have 2 connections
- Nodes 3, 7 have 3 connections
- Nodes 1, 6, 8 have 4 connections
- Node 0 has 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles:

1. For edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
2. For edge (2, 9): No triangle formed.
3. For edge (2, 7): No triangle formed.
4. For edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
5. For edge (3, 4): Triangle <1, 3, 4> found.
6. For edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
7. For edge (7, 2): No triangle formed.
8. For edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
9. For edge (1, 8): No triangle formed.
10. For edge (0, 1): No triangle formed.
11. For edge (0, 4): Triangle <0, 1, 4> found.
12. For edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
13. For edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
14. For edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
15. For edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
16. For edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 4>
