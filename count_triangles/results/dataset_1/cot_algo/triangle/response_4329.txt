Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Vertices: 3, 4, 8, 5, 1, 7, 6, 0, 9, 2

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge and only consider the cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1) forms triangle <0, 1, 6>.
- Edge (0, 2) forms triangle <0, 2, 6>.
- Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (0, 5) forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- Edge (0, 9) forms triangle <0, 9, 2>.
- Edge (1, 0) already counted before.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 0) already counted before.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 0) already checked before.
- Edge (4, 2) already checked before.
- Edge (4, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) already checked before.
- Edge (5, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 1) already checked before.
- Edge (6, 2) already checked before.
- Edge (6, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 1) already checked before.
- Edge (7, 6) already checked before.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) already checked before.
- Edge (9, 2) already checked before.
- Edge (9, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [5]
