Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 6 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 5 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 1 connection
6: 2 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on the sorted order to get the new edge list:

(0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9)

Now we will count the triangles formed by these edges. Each triangle will have only one representation in the count.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
