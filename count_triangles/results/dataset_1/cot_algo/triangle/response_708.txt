Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degrees, the new labels for the nodes are:  

Node 0 - degree 4  
Node 1 - degree 3  
Node 2 - degree 2  
Node 3 - degree 2  
Node 4 - degree 2  
Node 5 - degree 5  
Node 6 - degree 5  
Node 7 - degree 6  
Node 8 - degree 1  

Now, checking for triangles based on the specified method, we find the following triangles:  
<0, 4, 7>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<2, 5, 6>  
<2, 5, 7>  
<3, 5, 7>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
