Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by the number of connections are: 
Vertices: 2, 9, 8, 7, 0, 5, 1, 6, 4, 3

Now, we will check for triangles based on the sorted order:

1. Checking edges with the lowest degree vertex 2:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 2.

2. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 9:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 9.

3. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 8:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 8.

4. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 7:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 7.

5. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 0:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 0.

6. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 5:
    - Triangle found: <0, 4, 5>

7. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 1:
    - No triangles can be formed with vertex 1.

8. Checking edges with the next lowest degree vertex 6:
    - Triangle found: <1, 4, 6>
    - Triangle found: <3, 4, 6>
    - Triangle found: <4, 5, 6>

9. Checking edges with the highest degree vertex 3:
    - Triangle found: <3, 4, 6>
    - Triangle found: <3, 4, 7>
    - Triangle found: <3, 6, 7>

The total number of triangles is [6].
