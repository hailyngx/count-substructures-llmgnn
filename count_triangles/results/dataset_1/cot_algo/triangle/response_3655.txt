Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree.

0: 3 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 4 connections
8: 1 connections
9: 6 connections

Now, relabel the vertices based on the sorting:

0 -> 8
1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 5
4 -> 1
5 -> 0
6 -> 7
7 -> 4
8 -> 6
9 -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge, considering only edges where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections:

<5, 0> forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <5, 0, 6>
<8, 6> forms a triangle with shared connection 0: <8, 6, 0>
<1, 2> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <1, 2, 9>
<1, 2> forms a triangle with shared connection 4: <1, 2, 4>
<2, 3> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 3, 9>
<3, 5> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <3, 5, 9>
<4, 1> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <4, 1, 9>
<5, 0> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <5, 0, 9>
<7, 4> forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <7, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
