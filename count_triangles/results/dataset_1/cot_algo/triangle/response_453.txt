Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the updated list of vertices with their connections in brackets: 
0 (3), 1 (3), 4 (2), 6 (2), 7 (2), 8 (3), 3 (3), 5 (2), 9 (4), 2 (1)

Now, we will proceed with counting triangles. 

Number of triangles: [17]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 9, 7>, <3, 9, 8>, <4, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 3>, <9, 7, 1>, <9, 7, 3>
