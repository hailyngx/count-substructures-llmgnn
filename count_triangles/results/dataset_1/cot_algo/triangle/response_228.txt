Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, the new labels will be as follows:  
Node 0: Degree 2  
Node 1: Degree 2  
Node 6: Degree 2  
Node 5: Degree 3  
Node 8: Degree 3  
Node 9: Degree 4  
Node 4: Degree 4  
Node 7: Degree 4  
Node 3: Degree 4  
Node 2: Degree 5  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we count the number of triangles and list them:  
Total number of triangles: [3]  
List of unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 5, 9>
