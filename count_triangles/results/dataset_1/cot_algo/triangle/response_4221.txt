Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 7: 0 connections
Nodes 0, 5, 7, 8: 1 connection each
Nodes 4, 6: 2 connections each
Nodes 2, 9: 3 connections each
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 3: 4 connections

Now, we will check each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 1) cannot form a triangle as 0 has fewer connections than 1.
- Edge (1, 2) can form a triangle <1, 2, 0>.
- Edge (1, 4) can form a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
- Edge (1, 9) can form a triangle <1, 9, 3>.
- Edge (2, 3) cannot form a triangle as 2 has more connections than 3.
- Edge (2, 6) can form a triangle <2, 6, 3>.
- Edge (3, 8) cannot form a triangle as 3 has more connections than 8.
- Edge (3, 9) can form a triangle <3, 9, 1>.
- Edge (4, 5) cannot form a triangle as 4 has fewer connections than 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
