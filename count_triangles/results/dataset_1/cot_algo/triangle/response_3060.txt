Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Sorting the nodes by their degree:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections

By following the degree-based ordering method, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

Triangles:
