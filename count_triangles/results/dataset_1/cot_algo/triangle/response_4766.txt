Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:
- 0: 2 connections
- 1: 4 connections
- 2: 3 connections
- 3: 4 connections
- 4: 2 connections
- 5: 3 connections
- 6: 3 connections
- 7: 3 connections
- 8: 2 connections
- 9: 2 connections

Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with vertex 2 forming triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (3, 9): No triangles formed.
- Edge (5, 6): Shared connections with vertex 3 forming triangle <3, 5, 6>.
- Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with vertex 3 forming triangle <3, 5, 7>.
- Edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>, <3, 5, 6>.
