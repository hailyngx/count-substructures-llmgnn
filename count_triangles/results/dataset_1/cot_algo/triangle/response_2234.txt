Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we relabel the vertices as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 3 has 2 connections.
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Node 5 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 2 connections.
- Node 6 has 3 connections.
- Node 1 has 3 connections.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.
- Node 4 has 9 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph by examining the edges based on the relabeled vertices.

There are 10 triangles in total: 
[10]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 4, 1>
