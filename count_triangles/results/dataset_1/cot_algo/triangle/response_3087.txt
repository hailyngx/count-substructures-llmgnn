Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the graph efficiently. Let's start by sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0(3), 3(3), 7(2), 8(1), 2(4), 6(4), 5(6), 1(6), 9(6), 4(6)

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree ordering:
8(1), 0(3), 3(3), 7(2), 2(4), 6(4), 1(6), 5(6), 9(6), 4(6)

Let's identify the triangles by examining the edges:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 2, 5>
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 9, 5>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 5>

Total number of triangles: [11]
