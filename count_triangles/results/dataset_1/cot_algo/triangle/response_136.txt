Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

We will now relabel the nodes according to their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 2) becomes Node 0
- Node 1 (degree 1) becomes Node 1
- Node 2 (degree 3) becomes Node 2
- Node 3 (degree 2) becomes Node 3
- Node 4 (degree 4) becomes Node 4
- Node 5 (degree 2) becomes Node 5
- Node 6 (degree 3) becomes Node 6
- Node 7 (degree 1) becomes Node 7
- Node 8 (degree 3) becomes Node 8
- Node 9 (degree 3) becomes Node 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 have a common neighbor Node 4
- Edge (0, 8): No triangle
- Edge (1, 4): No triangle
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 and Node 4 have a common neighbor Node 3
- Edge (2, 6): Node 2 and Node 6 have a common neighbor Node 4
- Edge (3, 0): Node 3 and Node 0 have a common neighbor Node 4
- Edge (3, 4): No triangle
- Edge (4, 1): No triangle
- Edge (4, 2): No triangle
- Edge (4, 3): No triangle
- Edge (5, 7): No triangle
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle
- Edge (6, 2): Node 6 and Node 2 have a common neighbor Node 4
- Edge (6, 8): Node 6 and Node 8 have a common neighbor Node 9
- Edge (6, 9): Node 6 and Node 9 have a common neighbor Node 8
- Edge (7, 5): No triangle
- Edge (8, 0): No triangle
- Edge (8, 6): Node 8 and Node 6 have a common neighbor Node 4
- Edge (8, 9): Node 8 and Node 9 have a common neighbor Node 6
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle
- Edge (9, 6): Node 9 and Node 6 have a common neighbor Node 8
- Edge (9, 8): No triangle

After counting the triangles, we find the following unique triangles:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
