Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) from least to most. Then, relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted vertices are: 1, 4, 7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 9, 2, 3.

We will now count the number of triangles:

1. For (0, 2): Both 0 and 2 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
2. For (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
3. For (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have the same number of connections as 1, so we skip this edge.
4. For (2, 0): 2 has fewer connections than 0, and they share a connection with 6, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
5. For (2, 4): Both 2 and 4 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
6. For (2, 6): 2 has fewer connections than 6, and they share a connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
7. For (2, 9): Both 2 and 9 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
8. For (3, 1): 3 has fewer connections than 1, and they share a connection with 9, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
9. For (3, 8): Both 3 and 8 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
10. For (3, 9): 3 has fewer connections than 9, and they share a connection with 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
11. For (4, 2): Both 4 and 2 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
12. For (5, 6): Both 5 and 6 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
13. For (5, 7): Both 5 and 7 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
14. For (5, 9): 5 has fewer connections than 9, and they share a connection with 6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
15. For (6, 0): 6 has fewer connections than 0, and they share a connection with 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
16. For (6, 2): 6 has fewer connections than 2, and they share a connection with 0, forming a triangle <0, 2, 6>.
17. For (6, 5): 6 has fewer connections than 5, and they share a connection with 9, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
18. For (6, 8): Both 6 and 8 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
19. For (6, 9): 6 has fewer connections than 9, and they share a connection with 5, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
20. For (7, 5): Both 7 and 5 have more connections than 1, so we skip this edge.
21. For (8, 3): 8 has fewer connections than 3, and they share a connection with 6, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
22. For (8, 6): 8 has fewer connections than 6, and they share a connection with 3, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
23. For (9, 2): 9 has fewer connections than 2, and they share a connection with 3, forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>.
24. For (9, 3): 9 has fewer connections than 3, and they share a connection with 1, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.
25. For (9, 5): 9 has fewer connections than 5, and they share a connection with 6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.
26. For (9, 6): 9 has fewer connections than 6, and they share a connection with 5, forming a triangle <5, 6, 9>.

There are a total of 7 triangles in the graph: [<0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <2, 3, 9>].
