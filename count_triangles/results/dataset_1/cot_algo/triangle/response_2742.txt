Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the labels of the vertices are as follows:
Node 4 has 0 connections
Nodes 0 and 1 have 1 connection each
Nodes 3, 6, and 8 have 2 connections each
Nodes 7 and 5 have 3 connections each
Node 2 has 6 connections
Node 9 has 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:
- For the edge (0, 2): Node 0 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 0 and 2 are 9 and 1, forming a triangle <0, 2, 1>.
- For the edge (0, 9): Node 0 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 0 and 9 are 2, forming a triangle <0, 9, 2>.
- For the edge (1, 2): Node 1 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 1 and 2 are 9, forming a triangle <1, 2, 9>.
- For the edge (1, 9): Node 1 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 1 and 9 are 2, forming a triangle <1, 9, 2>.
- For the edge (2, 0): Node 0 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 0 are 9, 1, forming a triangle <2, 0, 9>.
- For the edge (2, 1): Node 1 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 1 are 9, forming a triangle <2, 1, 9>.
- For the edge (2, 3): Node 2 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 3 are 9, forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>.
- For the edge (2, 7): Node 2 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 7 are 9, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
- For the edge (2, 8): Node 2 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 8 are 7, forming a triangle <2, 8, 7>.
- For the edge (2, 9): Node 2 is lower labeled, so we proceed. Shared connections with 2 and 9 are 3, 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, forming triangles <2, 9, 0>, <2, 9, 1>, <2, 9, 5>, <2, 9, 7>, <2, 9, 8>.
- Continue this process for all edges.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [10], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <0, 9, 2>, <1, 2, 9>, <2, 0, 9>, <2, 1, 9>, <2, 3, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 8, 7>.
