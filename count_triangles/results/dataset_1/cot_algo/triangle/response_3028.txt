Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degree, the new order is: 0, 7, 2, 8, 5, 6, 4, 1, 9, 3.

Now, we will check each edge starting from the ones between vertices with lower labels and count the triangles:

1. Edge between 0 and 2 creates 1 triangle: <0, 2, 5>
2. Edge between 0 and 3 creates 1 triangle: <0, 3, 1>
3. Edge between 0 and 5 creates 1 triangle: <0, 5, 4>
4. Edge between 1 and 3 does not create a triangle.
5. Edge between 1 and 4 creates 1 triangle: <1, 4, 3>
6. Edge between 1 and 9 does not create a triangle.
7. Edge between 2 and 0 creates 1 triangle: <2, 0, 5>
8. Edge between 3 and 0 does not create a triangle.
9. Edge between 3 and 1 does not create a triangle.
10. Edge between 3 and 4 does not create a triangle.
11. Edge between 3 and 6 does not create a triangle.
12. Edge between 4 and 1 does not create a triangle.
13. Edge between 4 and 3 does not create a triangle.
14. Edge between 4 and 5 does not create a triangle.
15. Edge between 4 and 6 does not create a triangle.
16. Edge between 5 and 0 creates 1 triangle: <5, 0, 4>
17. Edge between 5 and 4 does not create a triangle.
18. Edge between 5 and 7 does not create a triangle.
19. Edge between 6 and 3 does not create a triangle.
20. Edge between 6 and 4 does not create a triangle.
21. Edge between 6 and 9 does not create a triangle.
22. Edge between 7 and 5 does not create a triangle.
23. Edge between 8 and 9 does not create a triangle.
24. Edge between 9 and 1 does not create a triangle.
25. Edge between 9 and 6 does not create a triangle.
26. Edge between 9 and 8 does not create a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [5]
