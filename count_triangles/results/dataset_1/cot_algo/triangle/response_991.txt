Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by connections: (1, 2, 6) -> (1, 5) -> (4, 8) -> (0, 3, 7, 9) 

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:
0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 6
3 -> 1, 5 -> 5
4 -> 4, 8 -> 8
7 -> 0, 9 -> 3

Using the relabeled vertices, we will examine each edge:
Edge (0, 1) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (0, 6) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (0, 8) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (0, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (1, 0) - Discard (lower labeled vertex does not have fewer connections)

Edge (2, 3) - Discard (lower labeled vertex does not have fewer connections)

Edge (2, 7) - Discard (lower labeled vertex does not have fewer connections)

Edge (3, 2) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 5) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (3, 7) - Proceed
Shared connections:  [7]
Triangle found: <7, 1, 3>

Edge (3, 8) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (4, 7) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (4, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 3) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 7) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (5, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (6, 0) - Discard (lower labeled vertex does not have fewer connections)

Edge (7, 2) - Discard (lower labeled vertex does not have fewer connections)

Edge (7, 3) - Proceed
Shared connections:  [3]
Triangle found: <3, 1, 7>

Edge (7, 4) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (7, 5) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (8, 0) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (8, 3) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (8, 9) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (9, 0) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (9, 4) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (9, 5) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Edge (9, 8) - Proceed
Shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [2]
The unique triangles found are: <3, 1, 7> and <7, 1, 3>.
