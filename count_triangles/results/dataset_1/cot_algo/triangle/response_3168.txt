Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 1
Node 6 has degree 1
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
Triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [14].
