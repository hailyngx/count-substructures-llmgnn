Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their degree is as follows: 

Vertices: 1, 4, 6, 0, 8, 5, 3, 7, 2

Based on the edges provided, we proceed as follows:
- Edge (1, 3): Vertices 1 and 3 share a connection with vertex 7, forming a triangle. <1, 3, 7>
- Edge (1, 7): Vertices 1 and 7 share a connection with vertex 3, forming another triangle. <1, 7, 3>
- Edge (4, 5): Vertices 4 and 5 share a connection with vertex 0, forming a third triangle. <4, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
