Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 8 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 2 and 9 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 4, and 7 have 5 connections each.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges using the lowest labeled vertex first. 

By examining the shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we can identify the following triangles:
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2,4>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 5>
[]

Thus, there are a total of 6 unique triangles in the graph.
