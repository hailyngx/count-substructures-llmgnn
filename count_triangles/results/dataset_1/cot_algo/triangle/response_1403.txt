Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degree. The degrees of each vertex are:
- Vertex 1: degree 2
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 2
- Vertex 6: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 1
- Vertex 8: degree 5
- Vertex 9: degree 3

Now, we relabel the vertices:
- Vertex 7 (degree 1) becomes vertex 0
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 3 (degree 2) becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 9 (degree 3) becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 2 (degree 4) becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 8 (degree 5) becomes vertex 7

The edges to consider after relabeling:
- (0, 6)
- (1, 2)
- (1, 7)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 4)
- (3, 5)
- (6, 1)
- (4, 6)
- (4, 7)
- (5, 3)
- (7, 1)
- (7, 2)
- (7, 4)
- (7, 5)

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 1, 7>
- Triangle <3, 4, 5>

Thus, the total number of triangles is [3].
