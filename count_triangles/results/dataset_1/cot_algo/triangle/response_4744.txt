Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 3 and is labeled as 0.
- Node 3 has degree 3 and is labeled as 1.
- Node 4 has degree 2 and is labeled as 2.
- Node 5 has degree 3 and is labeled as 3.
- Node 2 has degree 3 and is labeled as 4.
- Node 8 has degree 3 and is labeled as 5.
- Node 7 has degree 1 and is labeled as 6.
- Node 1 has degree 7 and is labeled as 7.
- Node 6 has degree 5 and is labeled as 8.
- Node 9 has degree 6 and is labeled as 9.

Now, let's identify the triangles in the graph based on the connections between the vertices:
- The triangles found are: 
  <0, 1, 3>
  <1, 3, 9>
  <1, 4, 9>
  <1, 6, 9>
  <1, 8, 6>
  <1, 8, 2>
  <1, 8, 6>
  <2, 6, 8>
  <3, 5, 0>
  <3, 5, 1>
  <5, 0, 1>
  <5, 3, 1>
  <6, 2, 8>
  <6, 8, 1>
  <6, 8, 1>
  <6, 9, 1>
  <6, 9, 1>
  <6, 9, 3>
  <8, 1, 6>
  <8, 1, 6>
  <8, 1, 2>
  <8, 6, 9>
  <9, 1, 6>
  <9, 1, 6>
  <9, 1, 4>
  <9, 1, 6>
  <9, 3, 5>
  <9, 3, 1>
  <9, 4, 1>
  <9, 4, 1>
  <9, 6, 2>
  <9, 6, 8>
  <9, 7, 1> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [33].
