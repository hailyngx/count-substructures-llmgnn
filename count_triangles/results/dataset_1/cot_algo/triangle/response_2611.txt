Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Vertices: 7, 6, 1, 8, 5, 2, 3, 0, 9, 4

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles: [31]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 4, 8>
