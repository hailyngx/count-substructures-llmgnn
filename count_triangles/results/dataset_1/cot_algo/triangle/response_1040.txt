Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices: 
1. 1 (1 connection)
2. 8 (2 connections)
3. 5 (2 connections)
4. 6 (2 connections)
5. 7 (3 connections)
6. 9 (5 connections)
7. 2 (5 connections)
8. 4 (5 connections)
9. 3 (5 connections)
10. 0 (6 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <0, 4, 7>
3. <0, 6, 9>
4. <2, 3, 4>
5. <2, 4, 7>
6. <3, 4, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
