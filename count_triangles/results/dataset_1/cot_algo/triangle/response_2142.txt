Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the new labels for the vertices are: 

0 (degree 4), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 3), 8 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 1 (degree 5), 5 (degree 3), 3 (degree 5), 2 (degree 5), 4 (degree 5).

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:

- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections with 2 and 8, forming triangle <0, 2, 8>.
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 1 and 8, forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (0, 8): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle <0, 1, 8>.

- Edge (1, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (1, 3): Shared connection with 4, forming triangle <1, 4, 3>.
- Edge (1, 4): Shared connections with 3 and 9, forming triangle <1, 3, 9>.
- Edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
- Edge (1, 8): Already counted.
- Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with 3 and 4, forming triangle <1, 3, 4>.

- Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (2, 4): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (2, 6): No triangles formed.
- Edge (2, 7): Shared connection with 3, forming triangle <2, 3, 7>.
- Edge (2, 8): Already counted.

- Edge (3, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 5): Shared connection with 9, forming triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (3, 7): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections with 1 and 2, forming triangle <1, 2, 3>.
- Edge (3, 9): No new triangles formed.

- Edge (4, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with 1, forming triangle <1, 4, 9>.

- Edge (5, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.

- Edge (6, 2): No triangles formed.
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles formed.

- Edge (7, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (7, 3): Already counted.

- Edge (8, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (8, 3): Already counted.

- Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 3): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 5): No triangles formed.
- Edge (9, 6): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 9>.
