Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels are:
2, 5, 10, 3, 4, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9

Therefore, the graph with updated vertex labels looks like this:
Edges: (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 4) (10, 1) (3, 1) (4, 10) (6, 10) (7, 10) (1, 10) (8, 1) (9, 8)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph:
[Total number of triangles: 1]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 8, 9>
