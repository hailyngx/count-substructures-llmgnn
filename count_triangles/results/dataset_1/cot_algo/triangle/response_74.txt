Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze each edge starting from edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Analyzing the edges:
1. Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 7 <0, 3, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): No triangles.
3. Edge (0, 8): No triangles.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangles.
5. Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with node 5 <1, 4, 5>.
6. Edge (1, 5): No triangles.
7. Edge (2, 1): No triangles.
8. Edge (2, 3): Forms a triangle with node 7 <2, 3, 7>.
9. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 2, 4>.
10. Edge (2, 8): No triangles.
11. Edge (3, 0): No triangles.
12. Edge (3, 2): Forms a triangle with node 7 <2, 3, 7>.
13. Edge (3, 5): No triangles.
14. Edge (3, 6): No triangles.
15. Edge (3, 7): No triangles.
16. Edge (4, 1): Forms a triangle with node 5 <1, 4, 5>.
17. Edge (4, 2): Forms a triangle with node 0 <0, 2, 4>.
18. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with node 7 <4, 5, 7>.
19. Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with node 1 <1, 4, 7>.
20. Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with node 2 <2, 4, 8>.
21. Edge (5, 1): No triangles.
22. Edge (5, 3): No triangles.
23. Edge (5, 4): Forms a triangle with node 7 <4, 5, 7>.
24. Edge (5, 7): Forms a triangle with node 4 <4, 5, 7>.
25. Edge (6, 3): No triangles.
26. Edge (6, 7): No triangles.
27. Edge (7, 0): Forms a triangle with node 3 <0, 3, 7>.
28. Edge (7, 3): No triangles.
29. Edge (7, 4): Forms a triangle with node 1 <1, 4, 7>.
30. Edge (7, 5): Forms a triangle with node 4 <4, 5, 7>.
31. Edge (7, 6): No triangles.
32. Edge (8, 0): No triangles.
33. Edge (8, 2): No triangles.
34. Edge (8, 4): Forms a triangle with node 2 <2, 4, 8>.
35. Edge (8, 9): No triangles.
36. Edge (9, 8): No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6], and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 7>, <1, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 7>, <0, 2, 4>, <4, 5, 7>, and <1, 4, 7>.
