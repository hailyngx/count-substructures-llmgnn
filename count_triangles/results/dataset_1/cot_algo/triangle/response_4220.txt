Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 2 -> Degree 1
Vertex 9 -> Degree 1
Vertex 1 -> Degree 2
Vertex 5 -> Degree 2
Vertex 0 -> Degree 3
Vertex 3 -> Degree 0
Vertex 6 -> Degree 2
Vertex 8 -> Degree 3
Vertex 4 -> Degree 5
Vertex 7 -> Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are:
[8] triangles in total.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 1>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 6>
