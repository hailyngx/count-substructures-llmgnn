Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we have the following relabeling:
- Node 5 (degree 1)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 8 (degree 6)
- Node 4 (degree 6)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and following the steps you mentioned, we can count the number of triangles and then list them:

There are 8 triangles in total:

[8]

Unique triangles found:
