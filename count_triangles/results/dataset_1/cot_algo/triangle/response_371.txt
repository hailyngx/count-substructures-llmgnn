Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 8: 7 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges with vertices in increasing order of their labels:
1. Edge between Node 1 and Node 7: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <1, 4, 7>.
2. Edge between Node 1 and Node 4: No further triangles.
3. Edge between Node 2 and Node 4: No further triangles.
4. Edge between Node 2 and Node 7: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <2, 4, 7>.
5. Edge between Node 2 and Node 8: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <2, 4, 8>.
6. Edge between Node 3 and Node 6: No further triangles.
7. Edge between Node 3 and Node 8: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <3, 4, 8>.
8. Edge between Node 4 and Node 1: No further triangles.
9. Edge between Node 4 and Node 2: No further triangles.
10. Edge between Node 4 and Node 5: No further triangles.
11. Edge between Node 4 and Node 7: No further triangles.
12. Edge between Node 4 and Node 8: Shared connection with Node 6, forming a triangle <4, 6, 8>.
13. Edge between Node 4 and Node 9: No further triangles.
14. Edge between Node 5 and Node 0: Shared connection with Node 4. Triangle <0, 4, 5>.
