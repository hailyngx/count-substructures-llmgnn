Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

Sorted nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 (degree 1)
- Node 6 (degree 1)
- Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 8 (degree 2)
- Node 2 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 3)

Now, we will examine each edge:

(0, 8): Both 0 and 8 have degree 1, so we won't form a triangle.
(2, 3): 2 has degree 3, and 3 has degree 2. They share a connection with node 4, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
(2, 4): 2 has degree 3, and 4 has degree 3. They share a connection with node 3, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
(2, 9): 2 has degree 3, and 9 has degree 3. They share a connection with node 7, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
(3, 4): 3 has degree 2, and 4 has degree 3. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
(4, 7): 4 has degree 3, and 7 has degree 3. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 4, 7>.
(8, 6): Both 6 and 8 have degree 1, so we won't form a triangle.
(7, 4): Already counted in the triangle <2, 4, 7>.
(7, 9): 7 has degree 3, and 9 has degree 3. They share a connection with node 2, forming a triangle <2, 7, 9>.
(8, 0): Already counted in the triangle <2, 3, 4>.
(8, 6): Both 6 and 8 have degree 1, so we won't form a triangle.
(9, 2): Already counted in the triangle <2, 7, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <2, 3, 4>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 7>
