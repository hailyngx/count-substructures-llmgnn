Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections: 

Node 0: 5 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

After reordering the vertices, the new edge list becomes:

(2, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (4, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7)

Now, let's count the number of triangles:

Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<7, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 3>
<7, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<3, 6, 7>
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 7, 3>
