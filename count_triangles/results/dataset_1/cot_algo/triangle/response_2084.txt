Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by degree, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 1 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 2
Node 3 - degree 6
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 6 - degree 3
Node 7 - degree 4
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 9 - degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Calculating triangles involving edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. (0, 3): Shared connections with 9, 7
2. (0, 4): Shared connections with 2, 6
3. (0, 7): Shared connection with 3
4. (0, 8): No triangle
5. (1, 3): Shared connections with 9
6. (1, 5): No triangle
7. (1, 6): No triangle
8. (1, 9): Shared connection with 3
9. (2, 4): No triangle
10. (2, 9): No triangle
11. (3, 5): No triangle
12. (3, 7): Shared connection with 0
13. (3, 8): No triangle
14. (3, 9): Shared connections with 0, 1
15. (4, 6): No triangle
16. (4, 7): Shared connections with 0, 6
17. (5, 3): No triangle
18. (6, 7): Shared connections with 0, 4

Total number of triangles: [17]

Unique triangles: <0, 3, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 4>, <3, 9, 1>, <3, 9, 0>, <4, 6, 7>
