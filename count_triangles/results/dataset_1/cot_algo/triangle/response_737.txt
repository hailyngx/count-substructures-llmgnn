Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 
1. Vertex 4 with degree 0
2. Vertex 5 with degree 0
3. Vertex 8 with degree 0
4. Vertex 0 with degree 2
5. Vertex 5 with degree 2
6. Vertex 8 with degree 2
7. Vertex 9 with degree 2
8. Vertex 1 with degree 3
9. Vertex 7 with degree 3
10. Vertex 6 with degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles based on the given edges. 

The triangles are:
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5].
