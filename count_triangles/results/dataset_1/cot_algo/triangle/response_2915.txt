Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method of counting triangles involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Nodes 5, 7, and 9 have 3 connections each.
Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 0 and 2 have 5 connections each.
Node 3 has 6 connections.

We will now relabel the vertices based on the sorted connections:

Node 6 → Node 0
Node 1 → Node 1
Node 5 → Node 2
Node 7 → Node 3
Node 9 → Node 4
Node 4 → Node 5
Node 8 → Node 6
Node 0 → Node 7
Node 2 → Node 8
Node 3 → Node 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the lower label having fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 5 connections and Node 6 has 1 connection.
Checking edge (0, 3): Node 0 has 5 connections and Node 9 has 6 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (0, 8): Node 0 has 5 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (1, 3): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 9 has 6 connections.
Checking edge (1, 5): Node 1 has 2 connections and Node 2 has 3 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (3, 5): Node 9 has 6 connections and Node 2 has 3 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (6, 0): Node 7 has 5 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (7, 5): Node 3 has 3 connections and Node 2 has 3 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (7, 9): Node 3 has 3 connections and Node 4 has 3 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (8, 0): Node 6 has 4 connections and Node 0 has 5 connections, proceed.
Checking edge (8, 2): Node 6 has 4 connections and Node 8 has 5 connections, proceed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [21].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<0, 2, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 3, 8>
<0, 3, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 5, 9>
<2, 3, 5, 7>
