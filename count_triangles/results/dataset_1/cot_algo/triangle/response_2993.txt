Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 4: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 1 connection
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, there are 25 triangles in the graph. 
The unique triangles found are:
<1, 8, 2>
<1, 8, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<0, 8, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 1>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 3, 6>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 3, 9>
<6, 3, 1>
<8, 0, 6>
<8, 3, 0>
<8, 3, 1>
<8, 3, 2>
<9, 3, 2>
<9, 3, 1>
<9, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 1>
<3, 7, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [25].
