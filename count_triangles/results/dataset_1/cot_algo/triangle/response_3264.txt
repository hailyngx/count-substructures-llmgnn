Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
```
Vertex 0: degree 5
Vertex 1: degree 3
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 6
Vertex 9: degree 5
```

Now, by following the method of checking each edge involving the vertex with the lower label, we look at each edge to find triangles. 

After analyzing all edges and finding triangles, we count a total of 9 triangles:
[9]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 0, 3>
<3, 0, 9>
<3, 2, 4>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 6, 8>
