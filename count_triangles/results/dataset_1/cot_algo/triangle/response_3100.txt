Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections:
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
