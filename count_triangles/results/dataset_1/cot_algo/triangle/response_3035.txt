Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled according to their number of connections: 
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 have 4 connections
- Nodes 3 and 5 have 5 connections
- Nodes 6 and 8 have 6 connections

Now we will check for triangles:
- Checking edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 6> is found.
- Checking edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (1, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (1, 8): Triangle <1, 8, 3> is found.
- Checking edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 6> is found.
- Checking edge (2, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (2, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (3, 1): Already counted.
- Checking edge (3, 2): Already counted.
- Checking edge (3, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (3, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (4, 1): Already counted.
- Checking edge (4, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (5, 2): Already counted.
- Checking edge (5, 4): Already counted.
- Checking edge (5, 6): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (6, 1): Already counted.
- Checking edge (6, 2): Already counted.
- Checking edge (6, 3): Already counted.
- Checking edge (6, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (7, 2): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 0): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 1): Triangle <1, 8, 3> is found.
- Checking edge (8, 3): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 5): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (9, 7): No triangles can be formed.
- Checking edge (9, 8): No triangles can be formed.

Based on the above analysis, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are:
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 8, 3>
