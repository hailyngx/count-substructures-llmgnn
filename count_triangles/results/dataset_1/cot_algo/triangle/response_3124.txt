Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 3, 5, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 0, 2, 6, 7.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connection with vertex 6. Triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Shared connection with vertices 2 and 7. Triangles <0, 6, 2> and <0, 6, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 7): Shared connection with vertices 6 and 1. Triangle <0, 7, 1>.
4. Edge (0, 8): No triangles can be formed.
5. Edge (1, 4): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <1, 4, 8>.
6. Edge (1, 6): Shared connection with vertex 7. Triangle <1, 6, 7>.
7. Edge (1, 7): No triangles can be formed.
8. Edge (2, 6): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <2, 6, 8>.
9. Edge (2, 8): No triangles can be formed.
10. Edge (2, 9): No triangles can be formed.
11. Edge (3, 7): No triangles can be formed.
12. Edge (4, 9): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <4, 9, 8>.
13. Edge (5, 6): Shared connection with vertex 8. Triangle <5, 6, 8>.
14. Edge (5, 8): No triangles can be formed.
15. Edge (7, 9): No triangles can be formed.
16. Edge (8, 9): No triangles can be formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 6, 7>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 8>, <4, 9, 8>.
