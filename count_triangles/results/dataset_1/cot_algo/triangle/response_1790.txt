Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have:
Vertices: 8, 4, 0, 1, 3, 9, 6, 7, 2, 5

The triangles in the graph are as follows:
[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
