Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Node 2: Degree 0
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5
Node 9: Degree 5

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method: 
1. (0, 1) - Shared connections: None
2. (0, 3) - Shared connections: None
3. (0, 8) - Shared connections: None
4. (1, 0) - Shared connections: None
5. (3, 0) - Shared connections: None
6. (3, 4) - Shared connections: None
7. (3, 6) - Shared connections: None
8. (3, 9) - Shared connections: <3, 4, 9>
9. (4, 3) - Shared connections: None
10. (4, 6) - Shared connections: <3, 4, 6>
11. (4, 9) - Shared connections: None
12. (5, 9) - Shared connections: None
13. (6, 3) - Shared connections: None
14. (6, 4) - Shared connections: None
15. (6, 7) - Shared connections: None
16. (7, 6) - Shared connections: None
17. (7, 8) - Shared connections: None
18. (7, 9) - Shared connections: <7, 4, 9>
19. (8, 0) - Shared connections: None
20. (8, 7) - Shared connections: None
21. (9, 3) - Shared connections: None
22. (9, 4) - Shared connections: None
23. (9, 5) - Shared connections: None
24. (9, 7) - Shared connections: None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <3, 4, 9> and <7, 4, 9>.
