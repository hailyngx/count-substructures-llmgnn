Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to label the vertices based on their degree, starting from the vertex with the least connections. The labels are as follows:
- Node 3: Degree = 1
- Node 7: Degree = 1
- Node 2: Degree = 2
- Node 6: Degree = 2
- Node 4: Degree = 3
- Node 9: Degree = 4
- Node 1: Degree = 4
- Node 5: Degree = 5
- Node 8: Degree = 5
- Node 0: Degree = 6

Next, we will count the triangles formed by each edge. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections to ensure uniqueness.

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 5, 9>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 3>

Total triangles: [9]
