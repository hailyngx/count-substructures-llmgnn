Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 7 has 0 connections
- Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 9 have 1 connection each
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Nodes 1 and 6 have 3 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 8 has 5 connections

Since the node with lower label has fewer connections for all given edges, we proceed to count triangles:

- Triangle <0, 1, 3>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 8>
- Triangle <2, 3, 8>

Calculating the total number of triangles, we find [4].
