Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method can be applied as follows:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 1
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 2
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 6
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 2

Now, sorting the nodes based on their degrees:
1. Node 1 (degree 1)
2. Node 3 (degree 2)
3. Node 5 (degree 2)
4. Node 9 (degree 2)
5. Node 0 (degree 3)
6. Node 4 (degree 3)
7. Node 7 (degree 3)
8. Node 2 (degree 4)
9. Node 8 (degree 5)
10. Node 6 (degree 6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering, we will now count the triangles:

1. Edge (1, 2) - Only node 1 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
2. Edge (1, 8) - Only node 1 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
3. Edge (2, 1) - Proceeding with node 1. Shared connection with node 8 forms a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
4. Edge (2, 7) - Only node 2 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
5. Edge (2, 8) - Proceeding with node 2. Shared connection with node 1 forms a triangle <1, 2, 8>. Shared connection with node 7 forms another triangle <2, 7, 8>.
6. Edge (2, 9) - Only node 2 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
7. Edge (3, 6) - Only node 3 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
8. Edge (3, 9) - Only node 3 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
9. Edge (4, 5) - Only node 4 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
10. Edge (4, 6) - Proceeding with node 4. Shared connection with nodes 5 and 8 forms a triangle <4, 5, 8>.
11. Edge (4, 8) - Proceeding with node 4. Shared connections with nodes 5 and 6 form a triangle <4, 5, 6>. Shared connection with node 1 forms another triangle <1, 4, 8>.
12. Edge (5, 4) - Only node 4 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
13. Edge (5, 6) - Proceeding with node 5. Shared connection with node 4 forms a triangle <4, 5, 6>.
14. Edge (6, 0) - Only node 6 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
15. Edge (6, 3) - Only node 6 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
16. Edge (6, 4) - Only node 6 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
17. Edge (6, 5) - Only node 6 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
18. Edge (7, 0) - Only node 7 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
19. Edge (7, 2) - Proceeding with node 7. Shared connection with node 2 forms a triangle <2, 7, 8>.
20. Edge (7, 8) - Proceeding with node 7. Shared connections with nodes 1 and 2 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>. Shared connection with node 4 forms another triangle <4, 7, 8>.
21. Edge (8, 0) - Only node 8 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
22. Edge (8, 1) - Only node 8 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
23. Edge (8, 2) - Proceeding with node 8. Shared connections with nodes 1 and 7 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>. Shared connection with node 4 forms another triangle <4, 7, 8>.
24. Edge (8, 4) - Proceeding with node 8. Shared connection with nodes 1 and 2 forms a triangle <1, 2, 7>. Shared connection with node 4 forms another triangle <4, 7, 8>. Shared connection with node 5 forms another triangle <4, 5, 8>.
25. Edge (8, 7) - Proceeding with node 8. Shared connections with nodes 1 and 2 form a triangle <1, 2, 7>. Shared connection with node 4 forms another triangle <4, 7, 8>.
26. Edge (9, 2) - Only node 9 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.
27. Edge (9, 3) - Only node 9 (lower label) has fewer connections. No triangles.

Total number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles found: <1, 2, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <4, 5, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 7, 8>.
