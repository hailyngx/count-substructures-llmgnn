Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 3 degree: 1
- Vertex 7 degree: 2
- Vertex 1 degree: 2
- Vertex 9 degree: 3
- Vertex 0 degree: 2
- Vertex 6 degree: 3
- Vertex 4 degree: 0
- Vertex 5 degree: 3
- Vertex 2 degree: 5
- Vertex 8 degree: 5

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:

- Vertex 3 becomes vertex 0
- Vertex 7 becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 1 becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 9 becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 0 becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 6 becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 4 becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 5 becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 2 becomes vertex 8
- Vertex 8 becomes vertex 9

Now, using the degree-based ordering, we will go through each edge to count the triangles:

For edge (0, 2): No triangle
For edge (1, 6): No triangle
For edge (2, 0): No triangle
For edge (2, 8): Triangle found <0, 2, 8>
For edge (2, 9): No triangle
For edge (3, 5): No triangle
For edge (5, 3): No triangle
For edge (5, 7): No triangle
For edge (6, 1): No triangle
For edge (6, 8): No triangle
For edge (7, 5): No triangle
For edge (7, 8): No triangle
For edge (8, 2): Triangle found <0, 2, 8>
For edge (8, 6): Triangle found <0, 6, 8>
For edge (8, 7): No triangle
For edge (8, 9): Triangle found <0, 8, 9>
For edge (9, 2): Triangle found <0, 2, 9>
For edge (9, 8): No triangle

Total number of triangles: [4]
