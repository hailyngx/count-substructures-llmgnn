Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we obtain the following labels for the nodes:  
Node 0 - Degree 2  
Node 1 - Degree 3  
Node 5 - Degree 2  
Node 6 - Degree 1  
Node 8 - Degree 2  
Node 9 - Degree 3  
Node 3 - Degree 4  
Node 4 - Degree 4  
Node 2 - Degree 4  
Node 7 - Degree 6 
 
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.
Here are the triangles found:  
<1, 2, 7>  
<1, 2, 9>  
<1, 4, 7>  
<2, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 7>  
  
The total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
