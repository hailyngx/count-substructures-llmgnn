Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have the following new labels:  
Nodes:  
0 - degree 2  
3 - degree 2  
7 - degree 2  
4 - degree 3  
8 - degree 4  
5 - degree 4  
1 - degree 5  
6 - degree 5  
2 - degree 6  
9 - degree 6  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we look at edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:  
Finding triangles:  
For edge (0, 6): 0 and 6 share 2 connections (7 and 9) forming a triangle {0, 6, 9}
For edge (0, 7): No triangles found.
For edge (1, 2): 1 and 2 share 1 connection (7) forming a triangle {1, 2, 7}
For edge (1, 4): 1 and 4 share 1 connection (5) forming a triangle {1, 4, 5}
For edge (1, 5): 1 and 5 share 2 connections (4 and 8) forming triangles {1, 5, 4} and {1, 5, 8}
For edge (1, 7): 1 and 7 share 2 connections (2 and 9) forming triangles {1, 7, 2} and {1, 7, 9}
For edge (2, 1): No triangles found.
For edge (2, 3): 2 and 3 share 1 connection (6) forming a triangle {2, 3, 6}
For edge (2, 6): 2 and 6 share 2 connections (0 and 9) forming triangles {2, 6, 0} and {2, 6, 9}
For edge (2, 8): 2 and 8 share 2 connections (4 and 5) forming triangles {2, 8, 4} and {2, 8, 5}
