Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 3: degree 0
- Nodes 7, 9: degree 1
- Nodes 2, 8: degree 2
- Nodes 0, 4, 6: degree 3
- Nodes 1, 5: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 3: relabeled as 0
- Nodes 7, 9: relabeled as 1
- Nodes 2, 8: relabeled as 2
- Nodes 0, 4, 6: relabeled as 3, 4, 5
- Nodes 1, 5: relabeled as 6, 7

Now, let's go through the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 5)
   - Node 0 has a degree of 3 and Node 5 has a degree of 4.
   - Since Node 0 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 5: 1
   - Triangle found: <0, 1, 5>

2. Edge (0, 6)
   - Node 0 has a degree of 3 and Node 6 has a degree of 3.
   - Since Node 0 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - No shared connections between Node 0 and Node 6.

3. Edge (1, 2)
   - Node 1 has a degree of 4 and Node 2 has a degree of 2.
   - Since Node 2 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - No shared connections between Node 1 and Node 2.

4. Edge (1, 4)
   - Node 1 has a degree of 4 and Node 4 has a degree of 3.
   - Since Node 4 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 4: 1
   - Triangle found: <1, 4, 5>

5. Edge (1, 5)
   - Node 1 has a degree of 4 and Node 5 has a degree of 4.
   - Since Node 1 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 5: 1
   - Triangle found: <0, 1, 5>

6. Edge (1, 9)
   - Node 1 has a degree of 4 and Node 9 has a degree of 1.
   - Since Node 9 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - No shared connections between Node 1 and Node 9.

7. Edge (2, 1) - Already covered.

8. Edge (4, 1) - Already covered.

9. Edge (4, 8)
   - Node 4 has a degree of 3 and Node 8 has a degree of 2.
   - Since Node 8 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - No shared connections between Node 4 and Node 8.

10. Edge (5, 0) - Already covered.

11. Edge (5, 1) - Already covered.

12. Edge (6, 0) - Already covered.

13. Edge (8, 4)
   - Node 8 has a degree of 2 and Node 4 has a degree of 3.
   - Since Node 8 has a lower label and fewer connections, we proceed.
   - No shared connections between Node 8 and Node 4.

14. Edge (9, 1) - Already covered.
