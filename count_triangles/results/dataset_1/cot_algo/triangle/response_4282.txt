Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Vertex 1 (degree 2)
- Vertex 6 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 3)
- Vertex 9 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (degree 6)
 
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles in the graph:

1. Edge (0, 5):
   - Shared connections with 5: 7, 9
   - Triangle: <0, 7, 5>

2. Edge (0, 7):
   - Shared connections with 7: 5, 8, 9
   - Triangles: <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 7>

3. Edge (0, 8):
   - Shared connections with 8: 7
   - Triangle: <0, 7, 8>

4. Edge (0, 9):
   - Shared connections with 9: 5, 7
   - Triangle: <0, 5, 9>

5. Edge (1, 3): No triangle.

6. Edge (1, 6): No triangle.

7. Edge (2, 7): No triangle.

8. Edge (3, 1): No triangle.

9. Edge (4, 7):
   - Shared connections with 7: 5, 8
   - Triangle: <4, 5, 7>

10. Edge (5, 0): Already counted.

11. Edge (5, 7): Already counted.

12. Edge (5, 9):
   - Shared connections with 9: 0, 7
   - Triangle: <5, 0, 9>, <5, 7, 9>

13. Edge (6, 1): No triangle.

14. Edge (7, 0): Already counted.

15. Edge (7, 2): No triangle.

16. Edge (7, 4): Already counted.

17. Edge (7, 5): Already counted.

18. Edge (7, 8): Already counted.

19. Edge (8, 0): Already counted.

20. Edge (8, 7): Already counted.

21. Edge (9, 0): Already counted.

22. Edge (9, 5): Already counted.


Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8], and the unique triangles found are <0, 5, 7>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 0, 9>, <5, 7, 9>.
