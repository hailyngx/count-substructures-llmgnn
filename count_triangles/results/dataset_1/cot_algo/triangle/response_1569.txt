Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 3 - degree 2
Node 1 - degree 2
Node 5 - degree 2
Node 7 - degree 2
Node 8 - degree 2
Node 0 - degree 4
Node 4 - degree 4
Node 9 - degree 4
Node 2 - degree 5
Node 6 - degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles in the graph:
1. Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <0, 2, 6>
3. Triangle <0, 2, 9>
4. Triangle <0, 4, 6>
5. Triangle <0, 4, 9>
6. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
7. Triangle <2, 4, 6>
8. Triangle <2, 4, 9>
9. Triangle <2, 6, 9>
10. Triangle <4, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
