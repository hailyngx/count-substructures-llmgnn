Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new node labels are as follows: 
Node 0 has 0 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles: 

[Total number of triangles: 10]

<0, 1, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
