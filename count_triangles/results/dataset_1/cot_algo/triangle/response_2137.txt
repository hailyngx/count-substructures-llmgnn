Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by the number of connections:
1. Node 1: 1 connection
2. Node 3: 1 connection
3. Node 4: 1 connection
4. Node 5: 1 connection
5. Node 9: 1 connection
6. Node 7: 3 connections
7. Node 0: 4 connections
8. Node 2: 4 connections
9. Node 6: 6 connections

Following the rule to only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Checking the edges, we see that the following edges are valid for counting triangles: 
(1, 2, 6), (2, 6, 7), (0, 6, 7), (6, 4, 9), (6, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are:
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
