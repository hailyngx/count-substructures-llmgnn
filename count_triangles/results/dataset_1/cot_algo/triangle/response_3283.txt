Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method proceeds by sorting nodes based on their degrees (number of connections) in ascending order. Here is the sorted list of nodes:

Node 6: 1 connection
Nodes 7, 5: 2 connections
Nodes 1, 9: 3 connections
Nodes 4, 8: 4 connections
Nodes 3, 2: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections

Following the method, let's identify the triangles:
- Focusing on the nodes with 1 connection first:
  - Node 6 cannot form a triangle as it has only 1 connection.

- Moving on to nodes with 2 connections:
  - Node 7 and Node 5 share a connection with Node 3, forming a triangle <3, 5, 7>.

- Next, nodes with 3 connections:
  - Node 1 and Node 9 share connections with Node 0, forming two triangles <0, 1, 9> and <0, 9, 1>. 

- Nodes with 4 connections:
  - Node 4 and Node 8 share connections with Node 1 and Node 2, forming two triangles <1, 2, 4> and <1, 4, 8>.

- Lastly, nodes with 5 connections:
  - Node 3 shares connections with Node 0 and Node 2, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.

Counting the total number of triangles in the graph, we find that there are [5] triangles as listed above.
