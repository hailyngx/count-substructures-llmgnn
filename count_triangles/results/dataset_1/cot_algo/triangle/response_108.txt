Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count triangles efficiently in this graph. 

The vertices with their connections sorted are:
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 2)
- Vertex 0 (degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (degree 4)
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (degree 5)
- Vertex 3 (degree 5)
- Vertex 2 (degree 6)
- Vertex 9 (degree 6)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering, we will count triangles based on shared connections between vertices. 

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7]. 

Unique triangles found:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <4, 1, 2>
- <6, 0, 9>
- <6, 7, 1>
- <8, 3, 9>
