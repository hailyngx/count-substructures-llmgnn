Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given graph:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections (degree):
0 (degree 1)
9 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
8 (degree 2)
1 (degree 0)
7 (degree 2)
4 (degree 3)
6 (degree 3)
3 (degree 4)
2 (degree 5)

As per the method, we will start with the vertices with the least connections. We will maintain the count of triangles as we go along.

Starting with vertex 0 (degree 1):
- Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 2. Check for shared connections of vertex 0 and 2. No shared connections. 

Moving to vertex 9 (degree 1):
- Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 7. Check for shared connections of vertex 9 and 7. No shared connections.

Moving to vertex 5 (degree 1):
- Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 2. Check for shared connections of vertex 5 and 2. No shared connections.

Moving to vertex 8 (degree 2):
- Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 4. Check for shared connections of vertex 8 and 4. No shared connections.

Moving to vertex 1 (degree 0):
- No triangles can be formed with vertex 1 as it has no connections.

Moving to vertex 7 (degree 2):
- Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 9. Check for shared connections of vertex 7 and 9. No shared connections.

Moving to vertex 4 (degree 3):
- Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 6, 7, and 8. 
  - Checking vertex 4 and 6 for shared connections: Shared connection with vertex 6.
  - Checking vertex 4 and 7 for shared connections: Shared connection with vertex 7.
  - Checking vertex 4 and 8 for shared connections: No shared connections.

Moving to vertex 6 (degree 3):
- Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 3, 4, and 7.
  - Checking vertex 6 and 3 for shared connections: No shared connections.
  - Checking vertex 6 and 7 for shared connections: Shared connection with vertex 7.

Moving to vertex 3 (degree 4):
- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 6.
  - Checking vertex 3 and 2 for shared connections: Shared connection with vertex 2.
  - Checking vertex 3 and 6 for shared connections: No shared connections.

Finally, vertex 2 (degree 5):
- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 0, 3, 5.
  - Checking vertex 2 and 0 for shared connections: No shared connections.
  - Checking vertex 2 and 3 for shared connections: Shared connection with vertex 3.
  - Checking vertex 2 and 5 for shared connections: No shared connections.
