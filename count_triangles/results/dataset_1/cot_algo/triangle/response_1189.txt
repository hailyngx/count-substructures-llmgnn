Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph with vertices relabeled based on their degree is:  
Vertices:  
0 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 2)  
5 (degree 2)  
7 (degree 2)  
6 (degree 2)  
3 (degree 2)  
4 (degree 3)  
9 (degree 3)  
8 (degree 4)  
2 (degree 4)  

Calculating the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:  
[15]  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 8>  
<0, 8, 5>  
<2, 3, 9>  
<4, 1, 8>  
<6, 7, 9>
