Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:
Node 0 - 2 connections
Node 1 - 3 connections
Node 2 - 2 connections
Node 3 - 6 connections
Node 4 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 6 - 3 connections
Node 7 - 2 connections
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 9 - 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 7), (7, 5), (8, 3), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

By examining the connections, we find the following triangles:
<1, 4, 3>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 9, 3>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
