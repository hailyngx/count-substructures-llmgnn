Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degrees, we have:

0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections
3: 4 connections
7: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the triangles:

- Triangle <0, 1, 4> (shared connection: 0-1 and 1-4)
- Triangle <3, 4, 9> (shared connection: 3-4 and 3-9)
- Triangle <6, 7, 9> (shared connection: 6-7 and 6-9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
