Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 3 -> Degree 1
Node 4 -> Degree 2
Node 7 -> Degree 2
Node 0 -> Degree 3
Node 9 -> Degree 3
Node 5 -> Degree 4
Node 1 -> Degree 4
Node 8 -> Degree 4
Node 6 -> Degree 6
Node 2 -> Degree 0

Now, let's identify the triangles formed by the edges in the graph:

1. Triangle <0, 6, 9>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
4. Triangle <4, 5, 9>
5. Triangle <5, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
7. Triangle <5, 6, 0>
8. Triangle <6, 7, 1>
9. Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
