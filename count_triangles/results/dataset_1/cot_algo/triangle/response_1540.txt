Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:  

Node 3 has degree 1  
Node 4 has degree 1  
Node 9 has degree 2  
Node 2 has degree 2  
Node 7 has degree 0  
Node 0 has degree 3  
Node 5 has degree 3  
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 1 has degree 4  
Node 8 has degree 4  

Ordering the nodes accordingly:  

Nodes: 3, 4, 9, 2, 7, 0, 5, 6, 1, 8  

Checking each edge where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:  
- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 8: <0, 1, 8>  
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (1, 0) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (1, 8) forms a triangle with node 0: <1, 8, 0>  
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (3, 8) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (5, 9) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (6, 4) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (8, 3) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle  
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle  

Total number of triangles: [2]  
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>
