Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees (number of connections). Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 
Vertex 7 (Degree: 0)
Vertex 8 (Degree: 2)
Vertex 9 (Degree: 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 1 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 3 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 5 (Degree: 3)
Vertex 6 (Degree: 4)
Vertex 2 (Degree: 5)
Vertex 4 (Degree: 6)

Now, we will iterate through the edges based on the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge.

Number of triangles: [7]

Unique triangles found:
<4, 0, 6>
