Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 4: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 6: 5 connections
- Node 7: 5 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges considering the lower labeled vertex first.

After analyzing all the edges, we find that there are a total of 8 triangles in the graph. The triangles are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
