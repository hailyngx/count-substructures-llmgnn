Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree: [1, 4, 8, 7, 5, 2, 6, 3, 0, 9]

Next, we will count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Using the given edges and the sorted vertices, we count the number of triangles:
[Total number of triangles: 21]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 5> <0, 3, 6> <0, 5, 6> <1, 2, 3> <1, 3, 4> <2, 3, 5> <2, 3, 6> <3, 5, 9> <3, 6, 9> <4, 1, 9> <5, 2, 9> <5, 3, 9> <6, 2, 9> <6, 3, 9> <7, 1, 9> <7, 3, 9> <8, 2, 9> <0, 5, 9> <0, 6, 9> <1, 3, 7> <2, 6, 8>
