Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following numbering for the vertices: 
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 4 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles by examining the shared connections between vertices connected by an edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

By examining the given graph, we find the following triangles:
<1, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<3, 6, 1>
<7, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
