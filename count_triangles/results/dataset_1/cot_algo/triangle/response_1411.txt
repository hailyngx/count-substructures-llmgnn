Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 5 and 7 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 5 have 3 connections each.
- Nodes 0 and 3 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 4 and 6 have 5 connections each.
- Node 8 has 6 connections.
- Node 9 has 7 connections.

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method and following the process described above, we can identify the total number of triangles as well as the unique triangles present in the graph.

The total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
