Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 7: 1 connection (to node 1)
Node 6: 1 connection (to node 0)
Node 2: 2 connections (to nodes 3 and 5)
Node 8: 2 connections (to nodes 3 and 4)
Node 9: 2 connections (to nodes 3 and 4)
Node 5: 3 connections (to nodes 2, 4, and 7)
Node 1: 4 connections (to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6)
Node 0: 4 connections (to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9)
Node 4: 4 connections (to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9)
Node 3: 5 connections (to nodes 0, 2, 8, 9, and 3)

Now we will count the triangles by considering the edges in order:

1. Edge (0, 3): Node 0 and Node 3 share Node 4. <0, 3, 4>
2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 and Node 4 share Node 3. <0, 4, 3>
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 and Node 3 share Nodes 0 and 4. Two triangles formed: <2, 3, 0> and <2, 3, 4>
6. Edge (2, 5): Node 2 and Node 5 share Node 7. <2, 5, 7>
7. Edge (3, 8): Node 3 and Node 8 share Node 4. <3, 8, 4>
8. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 and Node 9 share Node 4. <3, 9, 4>
9. Edge (4, 5): Node 4 and Node 5 share Node 2. <4, 5, 2>
10. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 and Node 8 share Node 3. <4, 8, 3>
11. Edge (4, 9): Node 4 and Node 9 share Node 3. <4, 9, 3>
12. Edge (5, 7): Node 5 and Node 7 share no common connections.
13. Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (7, 5): Node 5 and Node 7 share no common connections.
16. Edge (8, 3): No additional triangle formed.
17. Edge (8, 4): No additional triangle formed.
18. Edge (9, 3): No additional triangle formed.
19. Edge (9, 4): No additional triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 0>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 2>
