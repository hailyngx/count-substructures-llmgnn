Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 9: 1 connection
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 8: 3 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 6 connections
- Node 7: 7 connections

Using the sorted labels, we can now count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 7, 2>
<0, 7, 4>
<1, 4, 2>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<4, 3, 2>
<4, 3, 7>
<7, 3, 9>
<7, 8, 3>

Total number of triangles: [10]
