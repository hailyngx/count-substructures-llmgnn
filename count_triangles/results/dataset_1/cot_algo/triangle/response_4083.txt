Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:  

Node 4: 1 connection  
Node 7: 1 connection  
Node 1: 2 connections  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 2: 3 connections  
Node 5: 4 connections  
Node 8: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  

Using Degree-Based Ordering, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.  

Number of triangles: [8]  

Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 2>  
<0, 2, 3>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 5, 9>  
<0, 8, 9>  
<1, 2, 3>  
<2, 3, 6>  
<5, 8, 9>
