Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to re-label the vertices based on their number of connections. 

The new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 9: 6 connections
Node 5: 7 connections

Now, we can go through each edge based on the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections.

The triangles found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 8, 9>
<9, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
