Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the new edges are as follows: (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6).

Now, we will count the triangles:

 [5 triangles]

<0, 1, 4>

<1, 2, 6>

<1, 3, 7>

<1, 4, 6>

<1, 8, 9>
