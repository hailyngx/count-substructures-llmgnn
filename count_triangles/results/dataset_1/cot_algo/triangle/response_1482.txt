Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections). Then, the vertices are relabeled accordingly. Let's go through the process step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Degrees
- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 2
- Node 9: Degree 2

### Step 2: Sort Nodes by Degree
- After sorting: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 1

### Step 3: Relabel Nodes
- Relabeled: 0 -> 0, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 2, 7 -> 3, 8 -> 4, 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6, 5 -> 7, 6 -> 8, 1 -> 9

### Step 4: Analyze Edges
- (0, 3): Check as 0 < 2
  - Shared connections: None
- (0, 6): Check as 0 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (1, 4): Skip as 4 > 1
- (1, 6): Check as 1 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (1, 7): Skip as 7 > 1
- (2, 4): Check as 1 < 2
  - Shared connections: None
- (2, 9): Check as 1 < 5
  - Shared connections: None
- (3, 0): Skip as 3 > 2
- (3, 9): Check as 2 < 5
  - Shared connections: None
- (4, 1): Skip as 4 > 1
- (4, 2): Check as 1 < 2
  - Shared connections: None
- (4, 5): Check as 1 < 3
  - Shared connections: None
- (5, 4): Check as 1 < 3
  - Shared connections: None
- (5, 7): Check as 1 < 4
  - Shared connections: None
- (5, 8): Check as 1 < 4
  - Shared connections: None
- (6, 0): Check as 0 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (6, 1): Check as 1 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (6, 8): Check as 0 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (7, 1): Skip as 7 > 1
- (7, 5): Check as 1 < 4
  - Shared connections: None
- (8, 5): Check as 0 < 4
  - Shared connections: None
- (8, 6): Check as 0 < 6
  - Shared connections: None
- (9, 2): Check as 2 < 5
  - Shared connections: None
- (9, 3): Check as 2 < 5
  - Shared connections: None

### Step 5: Count Triangles
- Total number of triangles: [0]

### Step 6: List Unique Triangles
- Unique triangles: <>
