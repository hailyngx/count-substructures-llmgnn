Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Vertices sorted by degree: 

Vertex 1: 1 connection - Vertices: 5  
Vertex 4: 1 connection - Vertices: 7  
Vertex 0: 2 connections - Vertices: 9, 3  
Vertex 6: 2 connections - Vertices: 2, 8  
Vertex 3: 3 connections - Vertices: 0, 2, 8  
Vertex 8: 3 connections - Vertices: 3, 7, 9  
Vertex 2: 3 connections - Vertices: 3, 6, 9  
Vertex 9: 3 connections - Vertices: 0, 5, 2  
Vertex 5: 2 connections - Vertices: 0, 9  
Vertex 7: 2 connections - Vertices: 4, 8  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering:
1. (5, 9) - forms a triangle with node 0: Triangle <0, 5, 9>  
2. (7, 8) - forms a triangle with node 3 and 9: Triangles <3, 7, 8>, <8, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>  

Total number of triangles: [4]  
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 9>, <3, 7, 8>, <8, 7, 9>, <3, 8, 9>
