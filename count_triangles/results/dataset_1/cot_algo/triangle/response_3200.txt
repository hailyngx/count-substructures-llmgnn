Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following new labels:  
Node 3 has 0 connections.  
Nodes 0 and 4 have 3 connections each.  
Nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9 have 4 connections each.  
Nodes 2 and 7 have 5 connections each.  
Node 8 has 7 connections.  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.  

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <4, 8, 9>
