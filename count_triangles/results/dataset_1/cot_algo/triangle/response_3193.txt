Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in this graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections):
   - Node 7: degree 1
   - Node 3: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 2
   - Node 6: degree 3
   - Node 5: degree 4
   - Node 0: degree 4
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 9: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 5

2. Based on the degree-based ordering, we start counting triangles:
   - (7, 0) has no triangles
   - (3, 4) has no triangles
   - (8, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <8, 9, 4>
   - (6, 0) has no triangles
   - (5, 2) forms a triangle with node 4: <5, 2, 4>
   - (0, 6) has no triangles
   - (4, 2) forms a triangle with node 5: <4, 2, 5>
   - (2, 9) forms a triangle with node 4: <2, 9, 4>
   - (5, 3) has no triangles
   - (4, 8) forms a triangle with node 9: <4, 8, 9>

3. Counting the total number of triangles: [4]
   
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is 4.
