Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 1
Vertices 3, 7 have degree 2
Vertices 4, 5, 6, 9 have degree 3
Vertices 1, 2 have degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

<1, 2, 4> - Formed by edges (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4).
<1, 4, 6> - Formed by edges (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 6).

[Total number of triangles: 2]
