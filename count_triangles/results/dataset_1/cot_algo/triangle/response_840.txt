Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 8: 5 connections
Node 9: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

By checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we count the following triangles:

Unique triangles found:
<0, 2, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
