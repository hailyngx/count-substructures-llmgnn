Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:
The sorted vertices based on their degrees are: 2, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 4, 6, 3, 5.

After relabeling, the graph can be represented as follows:
Edges: (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 5), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (4, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (5, 5).

Now, counting the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 7, 8>
- Triangle <2, 7, 5>
- Triangle <7, 8, 1>
- Triangle <9, 0, 5>
- Triangle <9, 5, 6>
- Triangle <0, 5, 6>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
