Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by the number of connections:

Node 8: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles:

Triangles: [15]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
