Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels will be:  

Node 2 -> 0 connections  
Nodes 0, 3, 5 -> 1 connection  
Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8 -> 2 connections  
Nodes 1, 9 -> 3 connections  
Node 6 -> 6 connections  

Now, by considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can find the triangles:
- Triangle <0, 1, 4>
- Triangle <6, 7, 8>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
