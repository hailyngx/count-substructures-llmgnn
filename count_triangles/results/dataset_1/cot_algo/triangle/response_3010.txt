Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following order: 

Vertex 2 (Degree 2)
Vertex 6 (Degree 0)
Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)
Vertex 0 (Degree 5)
Vertex 5 (Degree 3)
Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
Vertex 8 (Degree 3)
Vertex 3 (Degree 4)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: []
Unique Triangles: <>
