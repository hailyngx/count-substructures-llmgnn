Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Vertex 8 connected to 1 vertices.
Vertex 6 connected to 2 vertices.
Vertex 9 connected to 2 vertices.
Vertex 5 connected to 3 vertices.
Vertex 7 connected to 3 vertices.
Vertex 3 connected to 4 vertices.
Vertex 2 connected to 4 vertices.
Vertex 1 connected to 5 vertices.
Vertex 0 connected to 6 vertices.
Vertex 4 connected to 6 vertices.

Now, using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:
1. Start with the edge (0, 2): No triangles formed.
2. Move to the edge (0, 3): No triangles formed.
3. Move to the edge (0, 4): Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
4. Move to the edge (0, 5): Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.
5. Move to the edge (1, 4): Triangle formed: <1, 4, 9>.
6. Move to the edge (1, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>.
7. Move to the edge (1, 6): No triangles formed.
8. Move to the edge (1, 7): No triangles formed.
9. Move to the edge (2, 7): No triangles formed.
10. Move to the edge (3, 4): Triangle formed: <3, 0, 4>.
11. Move to the edge (3, 7): Triangle formed: <3, 0, 7>.
12. Move to the edge (4, 9): Triangle formed: <4, 5, 9>.
13. Move to the edge (5, 9): No triangles formed.
14. Move to the edge (6, 8): No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [6]
Triangles found: <0, 2, 4>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 9>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 7>, <4, 5, 9>
