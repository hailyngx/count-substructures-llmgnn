Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the new labels as follows:
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 2 (not present): 0 connection
Node 5 (not present): 0 connection
Node 9 (not present): 0 connection
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we'll analyze the given edges by checking if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Analyzing edges:
(0, 1): Both vertices have the same degree, can't form a triangle.
(0, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections for (0, 6).
(0, 8): Node 0 has fewer connections for (0, 8).
(1, 6): Node 6 has fewer connections for (1, 6).
(1, 7): Node 7 has fewer connections for (1, 7).
(3, 4): Both vertices have the same degree, can't form a triangle.
(3, 8): Node 3 has fewer connections for (3, 8).
(4, 8): Node 4 has fewer connections for (4, 8).
(6, 0): Node 6 has fewer connections for (6, 0).
(6, 1): Node 6 has fewer connections for (6, 1).
(7, 1): Node 7 has fewer connections for (7, 1).
(7, 8): Node 7 has fewer connections for (7, 8).
(8, 0): Node 8 has fewer connections for (8, 0).
(8, 3): Node 3 has fewer connections for (8, 3).
(8, 4): Node 4 has fewer connections for (8, 4).
(8, 7): Node 7 has fewer connections for (8, 7).

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <3, 4, 8>, <6, 0, 8>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 8>.
