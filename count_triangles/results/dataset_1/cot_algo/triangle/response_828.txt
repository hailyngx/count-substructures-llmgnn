Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves first sorting the vertices based on their degree of connection. Here is the sorted list of nodes with their respective degrees:

Node 3: 1
Node 4: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 9: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 8: 4
Node 5: 5
Node 7: 5
Node 1: 7
Node 0: 8

Now, we will iterate through each edge and count the triangles. Since the lower labeled vertex in each edge should have fewer connections, we will only consider edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (5, 9), (8, 9)

After going through the process of counting triangles, we find that there are a total of [15] triangles in the graph. 
Here are the unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 6, 1>
<0, 6, 5>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 8, 5>
<1, 9, 5>
<2, 5, 9>
