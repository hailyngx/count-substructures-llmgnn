Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are: 
Vertices: 8, 0, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 12

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the given graph:

There are 6 unique triangles found:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 3, 9>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
