Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections. Here is the list of vertices with their corresponding degrees:
0: 2 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 0 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
9: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
0: 0 connections
1: 2 connections
2: 1 connection
3: 6 connections
4: 1 connection
5: 2 connections
6: 5 connections
7: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
9: 2 connections

Next, we will check the edges starting from the vertices with lower labels:
- Edge (0, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 6) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9) forms a triangle <1, 2, 9>.
- Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 9) forms a triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (6, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (7, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 7) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
