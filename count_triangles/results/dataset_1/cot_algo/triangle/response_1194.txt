Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 
Node 0 (Degree 3), Node 6 (Degree 1), Node 7 (Degree 2), Node 8 (Degree 2), Node 9 (Degree 3), Node 2 (Degree 4), Node 5 (Degree 4), Node 3 (Degree 5), Node 1 (Degree 6), Node 4 (Degree 6).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start counting the triangles:

1. For edge (0, 1):
   - Node 0 has connections with Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9. 
   - Node 1 has connections with Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 1 are Node 9.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.
   
2. For edge (0, 2):
   - Node 0 has connections with Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9. 
   - Node 2 has connections with Node 0, Node 4, and Node 5.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 2 are Node 4.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.

3. For edge (0, 9):
   - Node 0 has connections with Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9. 
   - Node 9 has connections with Node 0, Node 1, and Node 3.
   - Shared connections between Node 0 and Node 9 are Node 1.
   - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.

4. For edge (1, 3):
   - Node 1 has connections with Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.
   - Node 3 has connections with Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7.
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 3 are Node 4.
   - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 4>.

5. For edge (1, 4):
   - Node 1 has connections with Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9.
   - Node 4 has connections with Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8.
   - Shared connections between Node 1 and Node 4 are Node 8 and Node 3.
   - Triangles formed: <1, 4, 8> and <1, 4, 3>.

The total number of triangles in the graph is 3, and the unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 3>. Therefore, the answer is [3].
