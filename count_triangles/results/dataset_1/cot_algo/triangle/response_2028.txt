Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, we have:  
Vertices: (0, 3) (1, 4) (7) (9, 8) (6, 5) (2)

Examining the edges following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1) with shared connection 5 forms triangle <0, 1, 5>.
2. Edge (0, 4) with shared connection 5 forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
3. Edge (0, 6) with shared connection 5 forms triangle <0, 5, 6>.
4. Edge (1, 2) with shared connection 5 forms triangle <1, 2, 5>.
5. Edge (1, 5) with shared connection 0 forms triangle <0, 1, 5>.
6. Edge (1, 8) with shared connection 5 forms triangle <1, 5, 8>.
7. Edge (2, 5) with shared connection 1 forms triangle <1, 2, 5>.
8. Edge (2, 7) does not form a triangle based on the ordering.
9. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle based on the ordering.
10. Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle based on the ordering.
11. Edge (3, 6) does not form a triangle based on the ordering.
12. Edge (4, 5) with shared connection 0 forms triangle <0, 4, 5>.
13. Edge (5, 8) with shared connection 1 forms triangle <1, 5, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
