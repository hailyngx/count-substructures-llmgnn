Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows:
- Node 7: Degree 0
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 0: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 8
- Node 6: Degree 8

Using Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 6>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <3, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
