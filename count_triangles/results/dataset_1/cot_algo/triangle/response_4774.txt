Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
Vertices in order of degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 3 connections
7: 1 connection
8: 1 connection
9: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
3: 4 connections
2: 4 connections
4: 6 connections

Edges considered with lower labeled vertices having fewer connections:
(0, 2) - Shared connections with 6
(1, 3) - Shared connections with 4
(1, 4) - Shared connections with 2
(3, 5) - Shared connections with 9
(3, 9) - Shared connections with 5

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <1, 3, 4>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 9>
