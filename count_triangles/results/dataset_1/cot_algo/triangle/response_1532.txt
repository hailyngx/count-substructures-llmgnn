Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeling:
Vertices: 8, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 2, 7

Now, let's count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with shared connection 1: <0, 5, 1>
2. Edge (0, 7) does not form a triangle.
3. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with shared connection 5: <1, 2, 5>
4. Edge (1, 4) does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
6. Edge (2, 1) has a lower label on vertex 1, so skip.
7. Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 9: <2, 6, 9>
9. Edge (2, 9) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (3, 2) has a lower label on vertex 2, so skip.
11. Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 1) does not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 0) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 1) does not form a triangle.
15. Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle.
16. Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 0) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 8) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (8, 7) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (9, 2) does not form a triangle.
22. Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 1>, <2, 6, 9>
