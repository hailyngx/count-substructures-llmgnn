Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the labels for the vertices will be as follows:
Vertex 7 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 0 has 5 connections.
Vertex 2 has 5 connections.
Vertex 8 has 5 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.
Vertex 4 has 6 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the graph can be counted by examining the edges. 
The total number of triangles inside brackets is [4].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 5>, <0, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <3, 5, 8>.
