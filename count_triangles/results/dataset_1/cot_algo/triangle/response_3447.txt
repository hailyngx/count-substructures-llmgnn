Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree in ascending order, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Vertices: 9, 1, 5, 4, 7, 2, 3, 8, 6, 0

Now, let's analyze the edges based on the degree-based ordering method to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 6): Both 0 and 6 have connections with vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 6, 7>.
2. Edge (0, 7): Both 0 and 7 have connections with vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 7, 1>.
3. Edge (0, 9): Both 0 and 9 have connections with vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 9, 4>.
4. Edge (1, 2): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 3): Both 1 and 3 have connections with vertex 6, forming a triangle <1, 3, 6>.
6. Edge (1, 7): Both 1 and 7 have connections with vertex 8, forming a triangle <1, 7, 8>.
7. Edge (1, 8): Both 1 and 8 have connections with vertex 3, forming a triangle <1, 8, 3>.
8. Edge (2, 1): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (2, 4): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 6): Both 2 and 6 have connections with vertex 0, forming a triangle <2, 6, 0>.
11. Edge (3, 1): No triangle formed.
12. Edge (3, 5): Both 3 and 5 have connections with vertex 9, forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
13. Edge (3, 6): Both 3 and 6 have connections with vertex 0, forming a triangle <3, 6, 0>.
14. Edge (3, 8): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (4, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (4, 9): Both 4 and 9 have connections with vertex 5, forming a triangle <4, 9, 5>.
17. Edge (5, 3): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (6, 0): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (6, 2): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (6, 3): Both 6 and 3 have connections with vertex 1, forming a triangle <6, 3, 1>.
22. Edge (6, 7): Both 6 and 7 have connections with vertex 1, forming a triangle <6, 7, 1>.
23. Edge (6, 8): Both 6 and 8 have connections with vertex 1, forming a triangle <6, 8, 1>.
24. Edge (7, 0): No triangle formed.
25. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
26. Edge (7, 6): No triangle formed.
27. Edge (8, 1): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (8, 3): No triangle formed.
29. Edge (8, 6): No triangle formed.
30. Edge (8, 9): Both 8 and 9 have connections with vertex 4, forming a triangle <8, 9, 4>.
31. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
32. Edge (9, 4): No triangle formed.
33. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.
34. Edge (9, 8): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
