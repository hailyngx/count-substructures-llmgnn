Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Vertices with 0 connections: 4, 5, 8
- Vertices with 1 connection: 2
- Vertices with 2 connections: 6
- Vertices with 3 connections: 1, 9
- Vertices with 4 connections: 0, 7
- Vertices with 2 connections: 3

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees:

0 → 7 connections
1 → 9 connections
2 → 1 connection
3 → 4 connections
4 → 0 connections
5 → 0 connections
6 → 2 connections
7 → 4 connections
8 → 0 connections
9 → 3 connections

Next, we will identify the triangles formed by the given edges:

- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle 3: <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle 4: <1, 6, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
