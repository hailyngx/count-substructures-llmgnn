Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Node 3 -> 0 connections  
Node 6 -> 0 connections  
Node 2 -> 1 connection  
Node 4 -> 0 connections  
Node 1 -> 3 connections  
Node 7 -> 4 connections  
Node 0 -> 5 connections  
Node 5 -> 5 connections  
Node 9 -> 5 connections  
Node 8 -> 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles by examining the edges in the graph.  

Triangles:
- <0, 5, 9>  
- <0, 5, 1>  
- <0, 5, 7>  

The total number of triangles is [3].
