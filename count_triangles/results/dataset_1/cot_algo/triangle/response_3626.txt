Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees. The sorted order of vertices based on their degrees is: 3, 1, 9, 8, 0, 7, 4, 2, 6, 5.

Now, we look at each edge and check if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. We then count the number of triangles formed.

Triangles formed by each edge:
(0, 2): <0, 2, 4>
(0, 5): <0, 5, 1>
(0, 7): No triangle
(1, 5): No triangle
(2, 4): No triangle
(2, 7): No triangle
(4, 5): <4, 5, 1>
(4, 6): <4, 6, 8>
(5, 6): <5, 6, 4>
(5, 8): <5, 8, 6>
(6, 8): <6, 8, 5>
(6, 9): <6, 9, 8>
(7, 9): <7, 9, 6>

Total number of triangles: [6]
