Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Node 7 : Degree 2
Node 0 : Degree 3
Node 2 : Degree 3
Node 5 : Degree 3
Node 9 : Degree 3
Node 4 : Degree 4
Node 6 : Degree 4
Node 8 : Degree 4
Node 1 : Degree 5
Node 3 : Degree 5

Using the method described in the instructions, we count the total number of triangles to be 11.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
