Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are:
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 8>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 8, 9>, <6, 7, 8>.
