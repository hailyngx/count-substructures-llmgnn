Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 2: Not present in the given list of edges

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we identify the following triangles: 
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
