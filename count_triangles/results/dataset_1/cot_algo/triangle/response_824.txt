Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 1, 7
Nodes: 8
Nodes: 6, 9
Nodes: 2, 5
Nodes: 4
Nodes: 3
Nodes: 0

Now, we will label the nodes accordingly:
Node 1 -> 0 connections
Node 7 -> 0 connections
Node 8 -> 2 connections
Node 6 -> 3 connections
Node 9 -> 3 connections
Node 2 -> 3 connections
Node 5 -> 4 connections
Node 4 -> 4 connections
Node 3 -> 6 connections
Node 0 -> 7 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
For the edge (0, 3):
Node 0 and Node 3 share connections with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
For the edge (0, 4):
Node 0 and Node 4 do not share connections.
For the edge (0, 7):
Node 0 and Node 7 do not share connections.
For the edge (0, 9):
Node 0 and Node 9 do not share connections.
For the edge (1, 3):
Node 1 and Node 3 do not share connections.
For the edge (2, 4):
Node 2 and Node 4 do not share connections.
For the edge (2, 6):
Node 2 and Node 6 do not share connections.
For the edge (2, 9):
Node 2 and Node 9 do not share connections.
For the edge (3, 0):
Node 3 and Node 0 share connections with Node 4. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
For the edge (3, 1):
Node 3 and Node 1 do not share connections.
For the edge (3, 4):
Node 3 and Node 4 share connections with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
For the edge (3, 5):
Node 3 and Node 5 share connections with Node 8. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (3, 6):
Node 3 and Node 6 share connections with Node 2. Triangle: <2, 3, 6>
For the edge (3, 8):
Node 3 and Node 8 share connections with Node 5. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (4, 0):
Node 4 and Node 0 do not share connections.
For the edge (4, 2):
Node 4 and Node 2 do not share connections.
For the edge (4, 3):
Node 4 and Node 3 share connections with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 3, 4>
For the edge (4, 5):
Node 4 and Node 5 do not share connections.
For the edge (5, 3):
Node 5 and Node 3 share connections with Node 8. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (5, 4):
Node 5 and Node 4 do not share connections.
For the edge (5, 6):
Node 5 and Node 6 do not share connections.
For the edge (5, 8):
Node 5 and Node 8 share connections with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (6, 2):
Node 6 and Node 2 do not share connections.
For the edge (6, 3):
Node 6 and Node 3 share connections with Node 2. Triangle: <2, 3, 6>
For the edge (6, 5):
Node 6 and Node 5 do not share connections.
For the edge (6, 8):
Node 6 and Node 8 share connections with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (7, 0):
Node 7 and Node 0 do not share connections.
For the edge (8, 3):
Node 8 and Node 3 share connections with Node 5. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (8, 5):
Node 8 and Node 5 share connections with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 5, 8>
For the edge (8, 6):
Node 8 and Node 6 share connections with Node 3. Triangle: <3, 6, 8>
For the edge (9, 0):
Node 9 and Node 0 do not share connections.
For the edge (9, 2):
Node 9 and Node 2 do not share connections.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 8>
