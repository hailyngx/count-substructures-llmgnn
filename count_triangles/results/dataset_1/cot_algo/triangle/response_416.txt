Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 7, 3, 0, 2, 5, 1, 6, 8, 9, 4

Using the given edges, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:
Triangles: 
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<8, 9, 4>

Total number of triangles: [8]
