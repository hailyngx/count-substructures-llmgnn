Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degree are as follows:
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertices 1, 9: 2 connections each
Vertices 0, 7: 3 connections each
Vertices 4, 5, 8: 4 connections each
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertices 2: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

(0, 6) and (0, 8) do not form a triangle.
(1, 4) and (1, 6) do not form a triangle.
(2, 5) forms the triangle <2, 4, 5>.
(2, 7) does not form a triangle.
(2, 8) does not form a triangle.
(3, 9) does not form a triangle.
(4, 1) and (4, 5) do not form a triangle.
(4, 6) forms the triangle <4, 5, 6>.
(5, 2) and (5, 7) do not form a triangle.
(5, 9) does not form a triangle.
(6, 0), (6, 1), and (6, 4) do not form a triangle.
(6, 7) forms the triangle <4, 6, 7>.
(7, 2) does not form a triangle.
(7, 5) and (7, 6) do not form a triangle.
(8, 0) and (8, 2) do not form a triangle.
(8, 9) does not form a triangle.
(9, 3) does not form a triangle.
(9, 5) and (9, 8) do not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles are <2, 4, 5> and <4, 6, 7>.
