Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 is connected to 2 vertices
- Vertex 2 is connected to 2 vertices
- Vertex 6 is connected to 3 vertices
- Vertex 5 is connected to 3 vertices
- Vertex 7 is connected to 4 vertices
- Vertex 8 is connected to 4 vertices
- Vertex 9 is connected to 4 vertices
- Vertex 1 is connected to 5 vertices
- Vertex 3 is connected to 5 vertices
- Vertex 4 is connected to 7 vertices

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and checking for shared connections, the total number of triangles in the graph is: 
[6]

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 1, 6>
<2, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
