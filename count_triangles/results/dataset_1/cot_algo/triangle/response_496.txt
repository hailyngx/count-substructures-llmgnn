Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
2: 2 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
6: 3 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 6 connections

We will relabel the vertices accordingly:

2: 0 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 3 connections
0: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
4: 4 connections
5: 4 connections
9: 6 connections

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph and only consider the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections. Then, we will check for shared connections to count triangles. 

The total number of triangles is [8] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 5, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>.
