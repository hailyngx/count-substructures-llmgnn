Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 9: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 5: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the following order:
(0, 2)
(0, 5)
(1, 5)
(1, 7)
(2, 0)
(6, 3)
(4, 2)
(9, 4)
(4, 5)
(5, 0)
(7, 1)
(8, 6)
(8, 7)
(9, 8)

The triangles found are:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<4, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
