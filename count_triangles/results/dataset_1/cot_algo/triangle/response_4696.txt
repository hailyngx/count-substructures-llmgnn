Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0 has degree 3,
Vertex 7 has degree 2,
Vertex 2 has degree 2,
Vertices 5 and 8 have degree 3,
Vertices 1 and 4 have degree 4,
Vertices 3 and 6 have degree 5.

After relabelling the vertices, the new graph will be as follows:
Vertices: 0, 7, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 3, 6
Edges: (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7)

Now, we will check for triangles based on the given edges:
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 5, 1>
- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 4, 2>
- Triangle <3, 5, 6>
- Triangle <3, 5, 1>
- Triangle <3, 5, 0>
- Triangle <5, 6, 1>
- Triangle <5, 6, 3>
- Triangle <5, 6, 0>
- Triangle <7, 1, 5>
- Triangle <7, 1, 3>
- Triangle <7, 8, 0>
- Triangle <7, 8, 1>

Total number of triangles: [16]
