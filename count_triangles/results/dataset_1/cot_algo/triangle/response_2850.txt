Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

- Checking edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 have 3 and 5 connections respectively. Node 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 0 and 1 are: 7. This forms a triangle <0, 1, 7>.

- Checking edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 have 3 and 5 connections respectively. Node 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 0 and 4 are: 7. This forms a triangle <0, 4, 7>.

- Checking edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 have 3 and 5 connections respectively. Node 0 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 0 and 7 are: 1, 4. This forms two triangles <0, 1, 7> and <0, 4, 7>.

- Checking edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 have 5 and 5 connections respectively. Both nodes have the same number of connections, so we skip this edge.

- Checking edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 have 5 and 6 connections respectively. Node 1 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 1 and 8 are: None. No triangle is formed.

- Checking edge (1, 9): Nodes 1 and 9 have 5 and 2 connections respectively. Node 9 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 1 and 9 are: 8. This forms a triangle <1, 9, 8>.

- Checking edge (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 have 1 and 5 connections respectively. Node 2 has fewer connections, so we proceed. Shared connections of nodes 2 and 7 are: None. No triangle is formed.

- Checking other edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections does not form any more triangles.

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

Unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 8>.
