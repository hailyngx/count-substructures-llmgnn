Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be as follows:
Node 0 has 5 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 5 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 5 connections.
Node 6 has 5 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and taking into account only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Triangles can be formed with the following unique combinations:
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
