Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 6
Node 0: Degree 7

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:

Node 5 (0) -> Node 0
Node 8 (1) -> Node 1
Node 2 (2) -> Node 2
Node 4 (3) -> Node 3
Node 1 (4) -> Node 4
Node 3 (5) -> Node 5
Node 7 (6) -> Node 6
Node 9 (7) -> Node 7
Node 6 (8) -> Node 8
Node 0 (9) -> Node 9

Now we check for triangles based on the connections:

- Triangle <2, 4, 5>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle <0, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
