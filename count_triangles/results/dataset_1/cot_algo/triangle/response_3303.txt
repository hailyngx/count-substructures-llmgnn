Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 
Nodes: 6, 7, 5, 0, 4, 9, 3, 1, 8, 2

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider each edge in the order specified:

1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 5. Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 2, 4>.

2. Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 8. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 4, 2>.

3. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 5. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1. Therefore, we have a triangle <0, 5, 1>.

4. Edge (1, 2): Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 2, 0>.

5. Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 9. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 3, 2>.

6. Edge (1, 5): Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 5, 0>.

7. Edge (1, 7): Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Node 7 has connections with nodes 1, 8. Therefore, we have a triangle <1, 7, 8>.

8. Edge (2, 3): Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 9. Therefore, we have a triangle <2, 3, 1>.

9. Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 8. Therefore, we have a triangle <2, 4, 0>.

10. Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Node 8 has connections with nodes 2, 4, and 7. Therefore, we have a triangle <2, 8, 4>.

11. Edge (3, 9): Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 9. Node 9 has connections with nodes 3, 6. Therefore, we have a triangle <3, 9, 6>.

After considering all edges, the total number of triangles found is [8].
