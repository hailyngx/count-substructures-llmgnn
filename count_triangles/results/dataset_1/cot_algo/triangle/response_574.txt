Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:
Nodes in increasing degree: 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, 7, 2, 1, 8, 4

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:

- Vertex 6 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed involving vertex 6.
- Vertex 9 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed involving vertex 9.
- Vertex 3 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed involving vertex 3.
- Vertex 5 (degree 3): Triangles: <0, 1, 5>.
- Vertex 0 (degree 4): Triangles: <1, 4, 0>, <1, 5, 0>, <4, 5, 0>.
- Vertex 7 (degree 4): Triangles: <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 7>.
- Vertex 2 (degree 4): Triangles: <1, 8, 2>, <1, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 2>.
- Vertex 1 (degree 5): Triangles: <4, 8, 1>, <5, 8, 1>, <0, 4, 1>, <0, 5, 1>.
- Vertex 8 (degree 5): Triangles: <4, 6, 8>, <4, 9, 8>.
- Vertex 4 (degree 6): Triangles: <5, 0, 4>, <0, 8, 4>, <1, 8, 4>.

Total number of triangles: [14]
