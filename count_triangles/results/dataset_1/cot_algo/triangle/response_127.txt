Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new vertex labels will be: 

Vertex 0 - 5 connections
Vertex 2 - 2 connections
Vertex 4 - 2 connections
Vertex 5 - 2 connections
Vertex 7 - 2 connections
Vertex 8 - 3 connections
Vertex 9 - 3 connections
Vertex 3 - 6 connections
Vertex 6 - 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

For this graph, the triangles are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>

The total number of triangles is [8].
