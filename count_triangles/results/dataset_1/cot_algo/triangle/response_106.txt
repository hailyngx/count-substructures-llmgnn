Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph with vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Vertices: 0, 2, 9, 7, 1, 8, 4, 5, 6, 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles:

Edges to consider:
(0, 3)
(1, 4)
(1, 7)
(1, 8)
(3, 5)
(3, 6)
(3, 7)
(3, 8)
(4, 5)
(4, 6)
(5, 6)
(5, 8)
(7, 9)

Calculating triangles:
<0, 3, 7>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 7, 9>
<1, 3, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 6>
<5, 6, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 9]
