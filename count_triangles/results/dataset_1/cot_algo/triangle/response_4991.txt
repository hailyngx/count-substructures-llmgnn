Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for each node are as follows:
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 3 has degree 4
Node 4 has degree 6
Node 8 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 6

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine the edges in the order specified:
1. (0, 4): Forms triangles with 1, 3, 7 <0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 7> <0, 3, 7>.
2. (0, 7): Forms a triangle with 1 <0, 1, 7>.
3. (1, 4): No triangles formed.
4. (1, 5): No triangles formed.
5. (1, 7): Forms triangles with 0, 3 <0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 7>.
6. (2, 8): No triangles formed.
7. (2, 9): No triangles formed.
8. (3, 4): Forms a triangle with 9 <3, 4, 9>.
9. (3, 7): Forms a triangle with 0 <0, 3, 7>.
10. (3, 9): No triangles formed.
11. (4, 0): Forms triangles with 1, 3, 7 <0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 7> <0, 3, 7>.
12. (4, 1): No triangles formed.
13. (4, 3): Forms a triangle with 9 <3, 4, 9>.
14. (4, 9): No triangles formed.
15. (5, 1): No triangles formed.
16. (5, 8): No triangles formed.
17. (6, 8): No triangles formed.
18. (7, 0): Forms a triangle with 1 <0, 1, 7>.
19. (7, 1): Forms triangles with 0, 3 <0, 1, 3> <0, 1, 7>.
20. (7, 3): Forms a triangle with 0 <0, 3, 7>.
21. (8, 2): No triangles formed.
22. (8, 5): No triangles formed.
23. (8, 6): No triangles formed.
24. (8, 9): Forms a triangle with 4 <4, 8, 9>.
25. (9, 2): No triangles formed.
26. (9, 3): No triangles formed.
27. (9, 4): Forms a triangle with 8 <4, 8, 9>.
28. (9, 8): Forms a triangle with 4 <4, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <3, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 7>, <4, 8, 9>.
