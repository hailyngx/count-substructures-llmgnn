Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we get the following new labels for the vertices: 

Vertices: 5, 1, 9, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8, 0, 3

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:

(3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (8, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 7) 

By examining the shared connections between vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles: 

<3, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
