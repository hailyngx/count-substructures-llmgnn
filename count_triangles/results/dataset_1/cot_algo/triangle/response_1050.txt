Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 0 -> 2 connections
- Node 5 -> 2 connections
- Node 2 -> 3 connections
- Node 7 -> 3 connections
- Node 1 -> 4 connections
- Node 4 -> 4 connections
- Node 6 -> 4 connections
- Node 8 -> 5 connections
- Node 3 -> 6 connections
- Node 9 -> 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and identify them:
1. (1, 2) shares connections with (1, 4) and (2, 4) -> <1, 2, 4>
2. (1, 6) shares connections with (1, 9) and (6, 9) -> <1, 6, 9>
3. (2, 1) shares connections with (2, 8) and (1, 8) -> <1, 2, 8>
4. (3, 0) shares connections with (3, 4) and (0, 4) -> <0, 3, 4>
5. (3, 4) shares connections with (3, 5) and (4, 5) -> <3, 4, 5>
6. (1, 4) shares connections with (1, 6) and (4, 6) -> <1, 4, 6>
7. (6, 1) shares connections with (6, 7) and (1, 7) -> <1, 6, 7>
8. (6, 7) shares connections with (6, 8) and (7, 8) -> <6, 7, 8>
9. (2, 8) shares connections with (2, 4) and (8, 4) -> <2, 4, 8>
10. (3, 4) shares connections with (3, 7) and (4, 7) -> <3, 4, 7>
11. (6, 8) shares connections with (6, 9) and (8, 9) -> <6, 8, 9>
12. (7, 6) shares connections with (7, 9) and (6, 9) -> <6, 7, 9>

Count of triangles: [12]
