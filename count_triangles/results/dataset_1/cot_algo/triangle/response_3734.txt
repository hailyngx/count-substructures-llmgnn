Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree:
Nodes sorted by degree:
1. Node 5 (degree 0)
2. Node 8 (degree 1)
3. Node 4 (degree 1)
4. Node 0 (degree 3)
5. Node 6 (degree 2)
6. Node 9 (degree 1)
7. Node 1 (degree 2)
8. Node 7 (degree 1)
9. Node 3 (degree 3)
10. Node 2 (degree 4)

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified while making sure that each time we consider an edge, the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections:

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 6>
<3, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
