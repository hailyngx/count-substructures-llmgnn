Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0 has degree 4
Vertex 1 has degree 2
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 6
Vertex 4 has degree 4
Vertex 5 has degree 3
Vertex 6 has degree 1
Vertex 7 has degree 2
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices from 0 to 9 based on their degrees in increasing order:

Vertex 6 (degree 1) -> Label 0
Vertex 1 (degree 2) -> Label 1
Vertex 7 (degree 2) -> Label 2
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> Label 3
Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> Label 4
Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> Label 5
Vertex 4 (degree 4) -> Label 6
Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> Label 7
Vertex 9 (degree 4) -> Label 8
Vertex 3 (degree 6) -> Label 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 3): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has connections with 4 and 5, we find a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has connections with 5, we find a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
3. Edge (0, 5): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has connections with 4, we find a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has no connections with 8.
5. Edge (1, 3): Since 1 < 9 and 1 has no connections with 3.
6. Edge (1, 9): Since 1 < 9 and 1 has no connections with 9.
7. Edge (2, 3): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 3.
8. Edge (2, 6): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 6.
9. Edge (2, 9): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 9.
10. Edge (3, 0): Since 3 < 9 and 3 has connections with 4 and 8, we find a triangle <0, 3, 4>.
11. Edge (3, 1): Since 1 < 9 and 1 has no connections with 3.
12. Edge (3, 2): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 3.
13. Edge (3, 7): Since 3 < 9 and 3 has connections with 4, 8, and 9, we find triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 7, 8>.
14. Edge (3, 8): Since 3 < 9 and 3 has connections with 4, we find a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
15. Edge (4, 0): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has no connections with 4.
16. Edge (4, 5): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 5.
17. Edge (4, 7): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 7.
18. Edge (4, 8): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 8.
19. Edge (5, 0): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has connections with 4 and 8, we find a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
20. Edge (5, 4): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 5.
21. Edge (5, 9): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 9.
22. Edge (6, 2): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 6.
23. Edge (7, 3): Since 3 < 9 and 3 has connections with 4, 8, and 9, we find triangles <0, 3, 4> and <3, 7, 8>.
24. Edge (7, 4): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 7.
25. Edge (8, 0): Since 0 < 9 and 0 has no connections with 8.
26. Edge (8, 3): Since 3 < 9 and 3 has connections with 4, we find a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
27. Edge (8, 4): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 8.
28. Edge (9, 1): Since 1 < 9 and 1 has no connections with 9.
29. Edge (9, 2): Since 2 < 9 and 2 has no connections with 9.
30. Edge (9, 5): Since 4 < 9 and 4 has no connections with 5.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
