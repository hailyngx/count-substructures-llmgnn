Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method in the given graph:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 2
Node 2 has degree 1
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 2
Node 5 has degree 2
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 3
Node 9 has degree 5

Therefore, we sort the nodes accordingly: 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 9, 3

Examining the edges while considering the lower labeled node to have fewer connections:

Triangles:
1. <0, 3, 9>
2. <3, 4, 9>
3. <3, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [3]
