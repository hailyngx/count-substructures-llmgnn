Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled from least to most connections as follows:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 0: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 6: 7 connections

Now, analyzing the edges with the vertex with the lower label having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 6. Triangle: <0, 1, 6>
2. Edge (0, 2): Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 6. Triangle: <0, 2, 6>
3. Edge (0, 6): No additional triangles.
4. Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle with Node 0 and Node 2. Triangle: <0, 2, 8>
5. Edge (1, 3): No additional triangles.
6. Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with Node 1 and Node 7. Triangle: <1, 6, 7>
7. Edge (1, 7): No additional triangles.
8. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 6. Triangle: <2, 5, 6>
9. Edge (2, 6): No additional triangles.
10. Edge (2, 7): Forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 5. Triangle: <2, 5, 7>
11. Edge (2, 8): No additional triangles.
12. Edge (3, 5): No additional triangles.
13. Edge (4, 5): Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 6. Triangle: <4, 5, 6>
14. Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with Node 4 and Node 8. Triangle: <4, 6, 8>
15. Edge (4, 8): No additional triangles.
16. Edge (5, 6): No additional triangles.
17. Edge (5, 7): No additional triangles.
18. Edge (6, 8): No additional triangles.
19. Edge (7, 8): No additional triangles.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>
