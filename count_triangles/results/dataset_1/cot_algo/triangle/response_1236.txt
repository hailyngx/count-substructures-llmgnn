Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following new labels for the vertices: 
Vertex 0 has degree 4 
Vertex 1 has degree 5 
Vertex 4 has degree 3 
Vertex 7 has degree 5 
Vertex 3 has degree 2 
Vertex 5 has degree 2 
Vertex 9 has degree 2 
Vertex 2 has degree 2 
Vertex 8 has degree 2 
Vertex 6 has degree 1 

Now, let's list the edges considering only the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:
(0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (7, 9) 

Now, let's count the number of triangles by checking for shared connections between the two vertices of each edge: 
1. <0, 1, 7>
2. <1, 3, 4>
3. <1, 4, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
