Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 4: 0 connections
Nodes 7, 1, 6, 2: 1 connection
Nodes 3, 5: 4 connections
Nodes 0, 8, 9: 5 connections

We will now check each edge based on the above labeling to count the triangles:

Checking edge (0, 3): Shared connections with 0 and 3 are 1 and 2. Triangle <0, 2, 3>.
Checking edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 0 and 8 are 5. Triangle <0, 5, 8>.
Checking edge (0, 9): Shared connections with 0 and 9 are 2. No triangle.
Checking edge (1, 3): Shared connections with 1 and 3 are 0, 2. Triangle <0, 1, 3>.
Checking edge (1, 5): Shared connections with 1 and 5 are 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (1, 6): Shared connections with 1 and 6 is 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (2, 3): Shared connections with 2 and 3 are 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (2, 9): Shared connections with 2 and 9 is 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (4, 5): Shared connections with 4 and 5 are 1. No triangle.
Checking edge (5, 7): Shared connections with 5 and 7 are 9. No triangle.
Checking edge (5, 8): Shared connections with 5 and 8 are 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (6, 8): Shared connections with 6 and 8 are 0. No triangle.
Checking edge (7, 9): Shared connections with 7 and 9 are 5. No triangle.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 5, 8>.
