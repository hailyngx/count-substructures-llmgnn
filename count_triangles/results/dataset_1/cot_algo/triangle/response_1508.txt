Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 2: 1 connection  
Vertices 5 and 8: 2 connections  
Vertices 1, 3, and 6: 3 connections  
Vertices 4 and 9: 4 connections  
Vertex 0: 5 connections  
Vertex 7: 6 connections  

Now, we will go through the edges in order to count the number of triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 and Vertex 1 share a connection with Vertex 6, forming a triangle <0, 1, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 and Vertex 4 share a connection with Vertex 8, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
3. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 and Vertex 6 share a connection with Vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 6, 1>.
4. Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 and Vertex 8 share a connection with Vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 8, 4>.
5. Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 and Vertex 9 share a connection with Vertex 4, forming a triangle <0, 9, 4>.

Since the above triangles are unique, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
