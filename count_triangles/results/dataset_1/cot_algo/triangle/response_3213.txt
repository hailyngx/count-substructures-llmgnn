Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Vertex 0 (degree 4)    
Vertex 1 (degree 0) -> relabeled as Vertex 1 (degree 0)    
Vertex 2 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Vertex 2 (degree 3)    
Vertex 3 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Vertex 3 (degree 4)    
Vertex 4 (degree 6) -> relabeled as Vertex 4 (degree 6)    
Vertex 5 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Vertex 5 (degree 3)    
Vertex 6 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Vertex 6 (degree 3)    
Vertex 7 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Vertex 7 (degree 4)    
Vertex 8 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Vertex 8 (degree 4)    
Vertex 9 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Vertex 9 (degree 3)    

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing the edges gives us the following triangles:  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 3, 7>  
<0, 4, 9>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<2, 4, 8>  
<3, 4, 7>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 6, 8>  
<4, 6, 9>  
<4, 7, 8>  
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
