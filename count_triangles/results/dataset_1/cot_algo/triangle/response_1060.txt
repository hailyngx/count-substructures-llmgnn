Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Node 0 has degree 2, Node 2 has degree 2, Node 5 has degree 2,
Node 3 has degree 3, Node 4 has degree 3, Node 8 has degree 3, Node 9 has degree 1,
Node 1 has degree 7, Node 6 has degree 7, Node 7 has degree 5.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(0, 1), (2, 1), (5, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (8, 6), (9, 6),
(6, 0), (3, 6), (7, 8), (7, 6), (4, 7), (7, 3), (5, 6),
(6, 1), (7, 1), (1, 6), (6, 3), (4, 7), (7, 3).

Going through the edges, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 6>, <6, 7, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
