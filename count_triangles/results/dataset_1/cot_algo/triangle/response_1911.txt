Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles can be applied as follows:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections from least to most:
Nodes: 3, 4, 6, 8, 6, 7, 1, 5, 9, 2

Edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
(0, 7) - shared connection with node 1 forms triangle <0, 1, 7>
(0, 8) - shared connection with node 9 forms triangle <0, 8, 9>
(0, 9) - shared connection with nodes 2 and 8 forms triangles <0, 2, 9> and <0, 8, 9>
(1, 2) - shared connection with node 7 forms triangle <1, 2, 7>

Output: [4]
