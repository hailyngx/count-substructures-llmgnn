Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are: 

Vertex 3 (Degree 1)  
Vertex 0 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 3)  
Vertex 5 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 7)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge. 

1. Edge (0, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
   They share vertex 1, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

2. Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
   They share vertex 0, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

3. Edge (1, 4): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
   They do not share any common neighbor.

4. Edge (1, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
   They do not share any common neighbor.

5. Edge (2, 0): We skip this edge as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 0.

6. Edge (2, 1): We skip this edge as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 1.

7. Edge (2, 5): We skip this edge as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5.

8. Edge (2, 6): We skip this edge as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6.

9. Edge (2, 7): We skip this edge as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 7.

10. Edge (3, 6): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

11. Edge (4, 1): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

12. Edge (5, 2): We skip this edge as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2.

13. Edge (5, 7): We skip this edge as vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 7.

14. Edge (5, 9): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

15. Edge (6, 2): We skip this edge as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2.

16. Edge (6, 3): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

17. Edge (6, 8): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

18. Edge (6, 9): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

19. Edge (7, 2): We skip this edge as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 2.

20. Edge (7, 5): We skip this edge as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 5.

21. Edge (8, 1): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

22. Edge (8, 6): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

23. Edge (9, 5): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 6, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

24. Edge (9, 6): Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 2, so we proceed.  
    They do not share any common neighbor.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 2> and <5, 6, 9>.
