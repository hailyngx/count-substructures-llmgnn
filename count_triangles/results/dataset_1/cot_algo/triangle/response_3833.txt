Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we have:

Nodes in increasing order of degrees: 3, 9, 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 7, 5, 2

After relabeling, the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are as follows:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 9), (8, 9)

Now, counting the triangles formed by the shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 8>
- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 6>
- Triangle <4, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4].
