Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted from least to most connections:
Node 3 (0 connections)
Node 1 (1 connection)
Node 5 (1 connection)
Node 9 (1 connection)
Node 2 (2 connections)
Node 8 (2 connections)
Node 0 (3 connections)
Node 6 (4 connections)
Node 7 (4 connections)
Node 4 (5 connections)

Counting triangles:
Triangles: [<0, 2, 4>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 6, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 0>, <7, 8, 5>]

The total number of triangles is [7].
