Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their degrees are: 

Node 4 has 1 connection(s).
Node 1 has 1 connection(s).
Node 9 has 2 connection(s).
Node 5 has 3 connection(s).
Node 8 has 3 connection(s).
Node 6 has 0 connection(s).
Node 0 has 4 connection(s).
Node 7 has 4 connection(s).
Node 2 has 4 connection(s).
Node 3 has 5 connection(s).

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the edges to consider are:
(1, 9), (4, 8), (5, 7), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (7, 5), (7, 3)

Now, we will count the triangles:

1. Triangle <1, 2, 9>
2. Triangle <2, 3, 9>
3. Triangle <2, 3, 5>
4. Triangle <5, 7, 3>

Total number of triangles: [4]
