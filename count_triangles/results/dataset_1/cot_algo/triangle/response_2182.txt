Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling will be:
Nodes: 4, 8, 3, 1, 2, 5, 0, 6, 9, 7

Calculating the triangles formed using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 6, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [6]
