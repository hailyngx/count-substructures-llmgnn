Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
Node 4 (1 connection) becomes node 0
Node 1 (2 connections) becomes node 1
Node 5 (2 connections) becomes node 2
Node 7 (2 connections) becomes node 3
Node 8 (1 connection) becomes node 4
Node 0 (3 connections) becomes node 5
Node 3 (3 connections) becomes node 6
Node 9 (3 connections) becomes node 7
Node 2 (4 connections) becomes node 8
Node 6 (4 connections) becomes node 9

Now, we will list the edges as per the new labels:
(5, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (0, 6) (4, 9) (8, 1) (0, 5) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (0, 7) (3, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2)

Now, we will count the triangles formed:
[6]

Unique triangles: 
<0, 6, 5>
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<3, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<2, 6, 5>
