Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes by their degrees from least to most connections:

Nodes by degree:
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Now, we will traverse each edge starting from the one with the node having the lower degree.

Triangles found:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 2, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 5>

Total number of triangles: [9]
