Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new order is: 5, 7, 2, 1, 6, 3, 8, 4, 9, 0.

Starting with the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 2: <1, 7, 2>.
2. Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 6: <2, 7, 6>.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, the total number of triangles is [2].
