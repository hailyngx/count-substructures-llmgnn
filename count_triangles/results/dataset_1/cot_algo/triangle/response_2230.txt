Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes based on their degree in ascending order:

0: degree 3
1: degree 2
4: degree 2
6: degree 2
9: degree 2
5: degree 3
3: degree 3
8: degree 5
2: degree 6

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 4 -> 3, 6 -> 4, 9 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 3 -> 7, 8 -> 8, 2 -> 9

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 2>
<1, 2, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
