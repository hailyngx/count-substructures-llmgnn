Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are:

- Node 1: 9 connections
- Node 3: 8 connections
- Node 5: 6 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 0: 6 connections
- Node 7: 6 connections
- Node 8: 8 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

The edges in the graph are: 
(0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
(1, 8)
(3, 6) (3, 7)
(4, 7) (4, 8)
(5, 8)
(6, 9)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 2): No triangles found
- Edge (0, 6): <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (0, 7): <0, 2, 7>
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles found
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles found
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles found
- Edge (3, 7): <0, 6, 7>
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles found
- Edge (4, 8): No triangles found
- Edge (5, 8): No triangles found
- Edge (6, 9): No triangles found

The total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6> and <0, 2, 7>.
