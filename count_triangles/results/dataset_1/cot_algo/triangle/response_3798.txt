Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following relabeled vertices:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 0 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 2 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges in this manner, we find that there are a total of 7 triangles in the graph. 

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 8>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 5, 0>
<4, 5, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
