Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 0 has degree 2,
Vertex 1 has degree 1,
Vertex 3 has degree 2,
Vertex 4 has degree 2,
Vertex 5 has degree 3,
Vertex 7 has degree 6,
Vertex 6 has degree 3,
Vertex 9 has degree 3,
Vertex 8 has degree 2.

Considering the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we have:
- Edge (1, 0) (Vertex 1 has degree 1)
- Edge (3, 5) (Vertex 3 has degree 2)
- Edge (3, 7) (Vertex 3 has degree 2)
- Edge (4, 5) (Vertex 4 has degree 2)
- Edge (4, 7) (Vertex 4 has degree 2)
- Edge (5, 3) (Vertex 3 has degree 2)
- Edge (5, 4) (Vertex 4 has degree 2)
- Edge (5, 7) (Vertex 5 has degree 3)
- Edge (6, 7) (Vertex 6 has degree 3)
- Edge (6, 9) (Vertex 6 has degree 3)
- Edge (8, 9) (Vertex 8 has degree 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [8].

The unique triangles found are:
<3, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
