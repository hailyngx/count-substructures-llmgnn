Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0 - degree 6
1 - degree 3
2 - degree 2
3 - degree 5
4 - degree 2
5 - degree 5
7 - degree 4
8 - degree 5
9 - degree 6

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method on the given edges:

(2, 7) - not considered as 2 has 2 connections which is less than 4
(4, 5) - not considered as 4 has 2 connections which is less than 5
(7, 0) - considered, shared connections with 7: 8, 9 and shared connections with 0: 8, 9. Triangle: <0, 7, 8>
(7, 2) - not considered as 7 has 4 connections which is more than 2
(8, 0) - considered, shared connections with 8: 5, 7, 9 and shared connections with 0: 7, 9. Triangle: <0, 8, 7>
(8, 2) - not considered as 8 has 5 connections which is more than 2
(7, 8) - not considered as 7 has 4 connections which is more than 5
(8, 5) - considered, shared connections with 8: 0, 7, 9 and shared connections with 5: 0, 3, 9. Triangles: <8, 0, 5>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 9>
(8, 7) - not considered as 7 has 4 connections which is less than 5
(8, 9) - considered, shared connections with 8: 0, 5, 7 and shared connections with 9: 0, 5, 7. Triangles: <8, 0, 9>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 7>
(9, 0) - considered, shared connections with 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and shared connections with 0: 7, 8. Triangles: <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 8>
(9, 1) - not considered as 9 has 6 connections which is more than 3
(9, 3) - considered, shared connections with 9: 0, 5, 7, 8 and shared connections with 3: 0, 1, 4, 5. Triangle: <9, 3, 0>, <9, 3, 5>
(9, 5) - considered, shared connections with 9: 0, 3, 7, 8 and shared connections with 5: 0, 3, 4, 8. Triangles: <9, 5, 0>, <9, 5, 3>, <9, 5, 8>
(9, 7) - not considered as 9 has 6 connections which is more than 4
(9, 8) - considered, shared connections with 9: 0, 5, 7 and shared connections with 8: 0, 5, 7. Triangles: <9, 8, 0>, <9, 8, 5>, <9, 8, 7>

Total number of triangles: [11]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 8>, <0, 8, 7>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 9>, <8, 0, 9>, <8, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 7>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 3, 0>, <9, 5, 0>, <9, 5, 3>, <9, 5, 8>, <9, 8, 0>, <9, 8, 5>, <9, 8, 7>
