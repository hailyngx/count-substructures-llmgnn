Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Node 3: 0 connections
Node 7: 0 connections
Node 5: 2 connections (0, 6)
Node 8: 2 connections (0, 2)
Node 4: 3 connections (1, 2, 6)
Node 1: 3 connections (2, 4, 6)
Node 0: 3 connections (2, 5, 8)
Node 2: 5 connections (0, 1, 4, 8)
Node 6: 5 connections (1, 4, 5)
Node 9: 0 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Edge (0, 2) is valid (0 and 2)
Edge (0, 5) is valid (0 and 5)
Edge (0, 8) is valid (0 and 8)
Edge (1, 2) is not valid (2 has more connections)
Edge (1, 4) is not valid (4 has more connections)
Edge (1, 6) is valid (1 and 6)
Edge (2, 4) is not valid (4 has more connections)
Edge (2, 8) is not valid (8 has more connections)
Edge (4, 6) is valid (4 and 6)
Edge (5, 6) is valid (5 and 6)

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 5>, <2, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>
