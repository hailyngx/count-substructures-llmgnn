Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Nodes sorted by their degree:
Node 7, 2, 5 have degree 1
Node 0, 2, 6 have degree 4
Node 8, 9 have degree 5
Node 1, 4 have degree 6
Node 3 has degree 7

Relabeled nodes:
Node 7 (degree 1) is now labeled 0
Node 2 (degree 1) is now labeled 1
Node 5 (degree 1) is now labeled 2
Node 0 (degree 4) is now labeled 3
Node 6 (degree 4) is now labeled 4
Node 8 (degree 5) is now labeled 5
Node 9 (degree 5) is now labeled 6
Node 1 (degree 6) is now labeled 7
Node 4 (degree 6) is now labeled 8
Node 3 (degree 7) is now labeled 9

Now we will count the triangles:
<3, 0, 4>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 1>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 6, 0>
<3, 6, 4>
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 4, 1>
<7, 4, 8>
<9, 3, 4>
<9, 4, 3>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 4, 1>
<9, 4, 3>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [22].
