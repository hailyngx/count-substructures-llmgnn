Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices are: 
- Node 2 has 1 connection
- Node 9 has 2 connections
- Nodes 1 and 5 have 3 connections
- Nodes 4, 6, and 0 have 4 connections
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 5 connections
- Node 3 has 6 connections

Using the method described, we analyze the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 3): Forms a triangle with shared connection 7. Triangle: <0, 3, 7>
- Edge (0, 7): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 7): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 9): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 4): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle: <3, 6, 5>
- Edge (3, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 5. Triangle: <4, 7, 5>
- Edge (5, 6): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 7): Forms a triangle with shared connection 8. Triangle: <5, 7, 8>
- Edge (5, 8): Does not form a triangle.
- Edge (6, 9): Does not form a triangle.

Therefore, there are [3] total triangles in the given graph, and the unique triangles found are: <0, 3, 7>, <3, 6, 5>, and <4, 7, 5>.
