Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method starts by sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted vertices with their connections are as follows:

Vertex 4: 1 connection
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 6 connections
Vertex 5: 7 connections

Starting with the edge connections in the order provided: 
(4, 3) - Does not form a triangle.
(6, 2) - Does not form a triangle.
(1, 5) - Forms a triangle <1, 5, 0>.
(9, 1) - Does not form a triangle.
(8, 5) - Forms a triangle <8, 5, 0>.
(0, 7) - Forms a triangle <0, 7, 2>.
(7, 3) - Forms a triangle <7, 3, 2>.
(3, 2) - Forms a triangle <3, 2, 5>.
(5, 8) - Forms a triangle <5, 8, 0>.
(2, 6) - Does not form a triangle.
(2, 8) - Forms a triangle <2, 8, 0>.
(2, 9) - Does not form a triangle.
(5, 3) - Forms a triangle <5, 3, 2>.
(2, 7) - Forms a triangle <2, 7, 0>.
(0, 5) - Forms a triangle <0, 5, 1>.
(0, 8) - Forms a triangle <0, 8, 5>.
(0, 7) - Forms a triangle <0, 7, 2>.
(1, 9) - Forms a triangle <1, 9, 2>.
(9, 2) - Forms a triangle <9, 2, 5>.
(7, 0) - Forms a triangle <7, 0, 5>.
(7, 2) - Forms a triangle <7, 2, 0>.
(7, 3) - Forms a triangle <7, 3, 2>.
(3, 4) - Does not form a triangle.
(5, 1) - Forms a triangle <5, 1, 0>.
(5, 2) - Forms a triangle <5, 2, 3>.
(5, 8) - Forms a triangle <5, 8, 0>.
(3, 5) - Forms a triangle <3, 5, 0>.
(2, 3) - Forms a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
(8, 0) - Forms a triangle <8, 0, 5>.
(8, 2) - Forms a triangle <8, 2, 5>.

The total number of triangles found is 13, which are:
[<1, 5, 0>, <8, 5, 0>, <0, 7, 2>, <7, 3, 2>, <3, 2, 5>, <5, 8, 0>, <2, 7, 0>, <0, 5, 1>, <0, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 2>, <9, 2, 5>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 2, 0>]
