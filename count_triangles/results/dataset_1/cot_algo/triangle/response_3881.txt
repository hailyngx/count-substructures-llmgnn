Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given edges sorted based on the number of connections for each vertex are as follows:

Vertices in increasing order of connections:
0 - 3 connections
6 - 2 connections
9 - 1 connection
5 - 2 connections
4 - 4 connections
2 - 4 connections
7 - 6 connections
Notice that we consider the reverse of the edge (a, b) same as (b, a), hence the edge counts are the same for both vertices.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can find the number of triangles in the graph:

Triangles found:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 5, 7>

Total number of triangles: [4]
