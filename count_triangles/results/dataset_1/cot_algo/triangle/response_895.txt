Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph with vertices sorted by their connection degree is as follows:
Vertices: 0(3), 1(2), 2(2), 3(1), 4(2), 5(2), 6(3), 7(2), 8(2), 9(1)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we see that for each edge we only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. This helps in counting each triangle only once.

Triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 8>
<4, 6, 5>

There are a total of [2] triangles in the given graph.
