Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 0: degree 4

Based on the degree-based ordering, we will process the edges as follows:
- Edge (0, 8) creates triangle with 1->8, forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.
- Edge (1, 4) and (3, 4) create triangle with 1->4, forming a triangle <1, 3, 4>.
- Edge (1, 7) and (2, 7) create triangle with 1->7, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (1, 8) and (3, 8) create triangle with 1->8, forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
- Edge (1, 9) and (9, 1) create triangle with 1->9, forming a triangle <1, 8, 9>.
- Edge (2, 3) and (3, 2) create triangle with 2->3, forming a triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (2, 5) and (5, 2) create triangle with 2->5, forming a triangle <2, 5, 8>.
- Edge (5, 6) and (6, 5) create triangle with 5->6, forming a triangle <5, 6, 8>.
- Edge (7, 1) and (1, 7) create triangle with 1->7, forming a triangle <1, 2, 7>.
- Edge (7, 2) and (2, 7) create triangle with 2->7, forming a triangle <2, 5, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 4>, and <2, 5, 8>.
