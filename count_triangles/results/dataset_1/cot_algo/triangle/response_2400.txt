Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertices sorted by degrees:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
9 (degree 2)
3 (degree 3)
5 (degree 3)
6 (degree 4)
4 (degree 5)
8 (degree 6)
2 (degree 6)

We will now relabel the vertices according to their degrees:
0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 9 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 5 -> 4, 6 -> 5, 4 -> 6, 8 -> 7, 2 -> 8

Now, we will analyze each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex:
Triangles found: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 8>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [6]
