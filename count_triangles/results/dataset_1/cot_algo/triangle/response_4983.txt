Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
0 (degree: 1)
3 (degree: 1)
5 (degree: 1)
6 (degree: 0)
1 (degree: 2)
7 (degree: 2)
2 (degree: 3)
8 (degree: 3)
4 (degree: 4)
9 (degree: 4)

Therefore, we start by examining edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 1): Forms a triangle <0, 1, 7>.
2. Edge (1, 7): Forms a triangle <1, 7, 9>.
3. Edge (2, 4): Forms a triangle <2, 4, 8>.
4. Edge (3, 4): Does not form a triangle.
5. Edge (5, 9): Does not form a triangle.

Total number of triangles: [3]
