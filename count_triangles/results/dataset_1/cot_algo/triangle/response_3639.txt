Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Vertex 1 has degree 1
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 5 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 4
- Vertex 7 has degree 4
- Vertex 2 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 5
- Vertex 4 has degree 6
- Vertex 3 has degree 6

The reordering of vertices based on degrees is: 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 5 -> 9 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6 -> 4 -> 3

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles formed by the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections.

After analyzing the graph, we find that there are 7 triangles present in the graph. 

The total number of triangles is [7].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>.
