Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are: 0, 7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 1, 4, 6, 8.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count triangles, we can identify the following unique triangles: <1, 4, 6>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].
