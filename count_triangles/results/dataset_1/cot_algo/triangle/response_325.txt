Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
Node 1 is connected to node 3.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
Node 6 is connected to node 3.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to node 3.

By sorting the nodes based on their degrees, we get the following order: 1, 9, 6, 0, 5, 2, 4, 8, 7, 3.

Now, going through the edges based on the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

For node 1: No triangles.
For node 9: No triangles.
For node 6: No triangles.
For node 0: Forms triangles with nodes 4, 5, and 7. (Triangles: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 5, 7>)
For node 5: Forms a triangle with node 3. (Triangle: <5, 0, 3>)
For node 2: No triangles.
For node 4: Forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 7. (Triangle: <0, 4, 7>)
For node 8: Forms a triangle with nodes 7 and 4. (Triangle: <8, 7, 4>)
For node 7: Forms triangles with nodes 0, 4, and 8. (Triangles: <7, 0, 4>, <7, 4, 8>)
For node 3: Forms triangles with nodes 5, 0, 6, 8, and 9. (Triangles: <3, 5, 0>, <3, 0, 4>, <3, 0, 7>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 9, 0>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 9, 7>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 7>)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
