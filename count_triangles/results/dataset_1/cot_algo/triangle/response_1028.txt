Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their degrees in ascending order:
Nodes: 1(1), 3(), 0(2), 4(2), 8(2), 3(), 6(3), 5(3), 9(4), 2(5)
Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 5) -> both nodes have degree 3
2. Edge (1, 2) -> node 1 has degree 1 and node 2 has degree 5
3. Edge (2, 4) -> both nodes have degree 5
4. Edge (2, 7) -> both nodes have degree 5
5. Edge (2, 9) -> both nodes have degree 5
6. Edge (4, 2) -> node 4 has degree 2 and node 2 has degree 5
7. Edge (5, 0) -> both nodes have degree 3
8. Edge (5, 7) -> node 5 has degree 3 and node 7 has degree 5
9. Edge (6, 7) -> node 6 has degree 3 and node 7 has degree 5
10. Edge (6, 9) -> both nodes have degree 3
11. Edge (7, 8) -> node 7 has degree 5 and node 8 has degree 2
12. Edge (8, 9) -> both nodes have degree 2

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles are <0, 5, 7>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 7>.
