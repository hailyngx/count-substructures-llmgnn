Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertex 1 has 1 connection
Vertex 4 has 2 connections
Vertex 8 has 2 connections
Vertex 3 has 2 connections
Vertex 9 has 3 connections
Vertex 5 has 3 connections
Vertex 7 has 3 connections
Vertex 2 has 4 connections
Vertex 6 has 6 connections
Vertex 0 has 7 connections

Now, we will proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 2) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 2 (degree: 4)
2. Edge (0, 3) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 3 (degree: 2)
3. Edge (0, 5) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 5 (degree: 3)
4. Edge (0, 6) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 6 (degree: 6)
5. Edge (0, 7) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 7 (degree: 3)
6. Edge (0, 9) -> Vertex 0 (degree: 7) is higher than Vertex 9 (degree: 3)
7. Edge (1, 8) -> Vertex 1 (degree: 1) is lower than Vertex 8 (degree: 2)
8. Edge (2, 4) -> Vertex 2 (degree: 4) is lower than Vertex 4 (degree: 2)
9. Edge (2, 5) -> Vertex 2 (degree: 4) is lower than Vertex 5 (degree: 3)
10. Edge (3, 6) -> Vertex 3 (degree: 2) is lower than Vertex 6 (degree: 6)
11. Edge (6, 4) -> Vertex 6 (degree: 6) is higher than Vertex 4 (degree: 2)
12. Edge (6, 7) -> Vertex 6 (degree: 6) is higher than Vertex 7 (degree: 3)
13. Edge (6, 9) -> Vertex 6 (degree: 6) is higher than Vertex 9 (degree: 3)
14. Edge (8, 1) -> Vertex 8 (degree: 2) is higher than Vertex 1 (degree: 1)
15. Edge (8, 9) -> Vertex 8 (degree: 2) is lower than Vertex 9 (degree: 3)

Now, we count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Triangle <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <0, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
