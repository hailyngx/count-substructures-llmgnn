Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the nodes based on their number of connections:

Nodes: 5, 6  
Nodes: 2, 4, 5, 6  
Nodes: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9  
Nodes: 1, 3, 5, 6  
Nodes: 7, 8  
Nodes: 1, 3, 7, 8  
Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8  

Now, we proceed with counting the triangles:

For node 5 and 6, there are no triangles.  
For nodes 2, 4, 5, 6:  
- Node 2 has triangles with nodes 1 and 8. Triangle: <2, 1, 8>.
- Node 4 has a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <4, 1, 9>.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have no triangles.

For nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9:  
- Node 0 has triangles with nodes 1 and 7. Triangles: <0, 1, 7> and <0, 3, 7>.
- Node 2 has already been accounted for.
- Nodes 4, 5, and 6 have no additional triangles.
- Node 9 has a triangle with node 4. Triangle: <9, 4, 7>.

For nodes 1, 3, 5, 6:  
- Node 1 has triangles with nodes 0, 7, and 8. Triangles: <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 7, 8>.
- Node 3 has triangles with nodes 0 and 1. Triangles: <3, 0, 1> and <3, 0, 7>.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have no additional triangles.

For nodes 7, 8:  
- Node 7 has triangles with nodes 0, 1, and 9. Triangles: <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
- Node 8 has triangles with nodes 1 and 9. Triangle: <8, 1, 9>.

Total number of triangles: [12]  
Unique triangles: <2, 1, 8>, <4, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 3, 7>, <9, 4, 7>, <1, 0, 7>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 7, 8>, <3, 0, 1>, <3, 0, 7>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 0, 3>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, <8, 1, 9>.
