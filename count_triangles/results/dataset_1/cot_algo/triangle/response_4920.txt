Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by the number of connections they have:

Node 0 - 2 connections  
Node 1 - 0 connections  
Node 2 - 4 connections  
Node 3 - 2 connections  
Node 4 - 2 connections  
Node 5 - 6 connections  
Node 6 - 4 connections  
Node 7 - 3 connections  
Node 8 - 3 connections  
Node 9 - 0 connections  

Now, we'll relabel the nodes accordingly:  

Node 1 (0 connections) -> Node 0  
Node 9 (0 connections) -> Node 1  
Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node 2  
Node 4 (2 connections) -> Node 3  
Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node 4  
Node 7 (3 connections) -> Node 5  
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 6  
Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node 7  
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node 8  
Node 5 (6 connections) -> Node 9  

Next, we'll go through each edge and count the number of triangles:
- Edge (0, 6): As Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 0 and Node 6 are Node 2 and Node 4, so there is a triangle <0, 2, 4>.

- Edge (2, 5): As Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 2 and Node 5 are Node 3, so there is a triangle <2, 5, 3>.

- Edge (2, 6): As Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 2 and Node 6 are Node 0 and Node 4, so there is a triangle <0, 2, 4>.

- Edge (3, 5): As Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 3 and Node 5 are Node 2, so there is a triangle <3, 5, 2>.

- Edge (4, 6): As Node 4 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 4 and Node 6 are Node 0, so there is a triangle <4, 6, 0>.

- Edge (5, 2): As Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 5 and Node 2 are Node 3, so there is a triangle <5, 2, 3>.

- Edge (5, 3): As Node 3 has 2 connections and Node 5 has 6 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 5 and Node 3 are Node 2, so there is a triangle <5, 3, 2>.

- Edge (5, 7): As Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 7 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 5 and Node 7 are Node 8, so there is a triangle <5, 7, 8>.

- Edge (5, 8): As Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 5 and Node 8 are Node 7, so there is a triangle <5, 8, 7>.

- Edge (6, 0): As Node 0 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 6 and Node 0 are Node 2 and Node 4, so there is a triangle <6, 0, 2> and <6, 0, 4>.

- Edge (6, 2): As Node 2 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 6 and Node 2 are Node 0 and Node 4, so there is a triangle <6, 2, 0> and <6, 2, 4>.

- Edge (6, 4): As Node 4 has 2 connections and Node 6 has 4 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 6 and Node 4 are Node 0, so there is a triangle <6, 4, 0>.

- Edge (7, 5): As Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 7 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 7 and Node 5 are Node 8, so there is a triangle <7, 5, 8>.

- Edge (7, 8): As Node 7 has 3 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 7 and Node 8 are Node 5, so there is a triangle <7, 8, 5>.

- Edge (8, 5): As Node 5 has 6 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 8 and Node 5 are Node 7, so there is a triangle <8, 5, 7>.

- Edge (8, 7): As Node 7 has 3 connections and Node 8 has 3 connections, proceed.
- Shared connections of Node 8 and Node 7 are Node 5, so there is a triangle <8, 7, 5>.

There are a total of 16 unique triangles formed in this graph.  
So, the number of triangles in the graph is [16].
