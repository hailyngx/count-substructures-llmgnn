Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

Nodes with the least connections:
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 1
Nodes with medium connections:
Node 9: Degree 2
Nodes with the most connections:
Nodes 1, 6: Degree 3
Nodes 0, 2, 5, 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 5

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:
Node 7 (Degree 1) -> Node 0
Node 4 (Degree 1) -> Node 1
Node 9 (Degree 2) -> Node 2
Nodes 1 and 6 (Degree 3) -> Nodes 3 and 4
Nodes 0, 2, 5, 8 (Degree 4) -> Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8
Node 3 (Degree 5) -> Node 9

Now, we will count the triangles:

<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 7]
