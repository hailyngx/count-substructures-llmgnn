Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 4: degree 1
Node 1: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 6
Node 5: degree 4

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we can find the following triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 6]
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 2>
<0, 4, 5>
<3, 7, 2>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 2, 8>
