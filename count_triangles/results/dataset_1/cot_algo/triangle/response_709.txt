Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their degrees:

0 (degree 1)
3 (degree 1)
5 (degree 1)
6 (degree 1)
7 (degree 1)
2 (degree 2)
1 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

0 -> 0 (degree 1)
3 -> 1 (degree 1)
5 -> 2 (degree 1)
6 -> 3 (degree 1)
7 -> 4 (degree 1)
2 -> 5 (degree 2)
1 -> 6 (degree 4)
4 -> 7 (degree 4)

Since we only proceed for edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can analyze the following edges:

(0, 1) - Proceed: Vertex 0 is the lower label
Shared connections (0, 1): None

(1, 2) - Proceed: Vertex 1 is the lower label
Shared connections (1, 2): None

(1, 5) - Proceed: Vertex 1 is the lower label
Shared connections (1, 5): None

(1, 6) - Proceed: Vertex 1 is the lower label
Shared connections (1, 6): None

(2, 4) - Proceed: Vertex 2 is the lower label
Shared connections (2, 4): None

(4, 7) - Proceed: Vertex 4 is the lower label
Shared connections (4, 7): None

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [0].
