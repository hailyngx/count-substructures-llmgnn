Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows: 

Nodes: 3, 9, 1, 6, 0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 7

By following the degree-based ordering method, we only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Analyzing the edges based on this method allows us to count the number of triangles. The total number of triangles found in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found are: 
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 6>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 9, 3>
<7, 9, 6>
