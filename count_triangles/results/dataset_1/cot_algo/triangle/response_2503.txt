Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following ordering:
Vertices: 1, 7, 4, 5, 3, 8, 0, 6, 2, 9

Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
Edges: (1, 5), (1, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (7, 1), (9, 7)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:
1. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
2. Triangle <1, 5, 7>
3. Triangle <4, 6, 0>
4. Triangle <4, 6, 5>
5. Triangle <7, 1, 5>
6. Triangle <7, 1, 9>

Therefore, there are 6 triangles in total inside brackets [] in this graph.
