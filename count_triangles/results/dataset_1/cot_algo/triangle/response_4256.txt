Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the nodes based on their degree:

- Node 6: 0 connections
- Nodes 0, 3, 9: 1 connection each
- Nodes 4, 5: 2 connections each
- Nodes 1, 7: 4 connections each
- Nodes 2, 8: 6 connections each

Next, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 6 (0 connections) becomes Node 0
- Nodes 0, 3, 9 (1 connection each) become Nodes 1, 2, 3 respectively
- Nodes 4, 5 (2 connections each) become Nodes 4, 5 respectively
- Nodes 1, 7 (4 connections each) become Nodes 6, 7 respectively
- Nodes 2, 8 (6 connections each) become Nodes 8, 9 respectively

Now, we will list the edges following the new labels:
(1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 8) (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
