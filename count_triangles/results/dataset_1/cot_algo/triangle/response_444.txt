Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes: 1, 3, 7
Node 1 is connected to nodes: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 2 is connected to nodes: 1, 5
Node 3 is connected to nodes: 0, 1, 7
Node 5 is connected to nodes: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 6 is connected to nodes: 1, 5, 7
Node 7 is connected to nodes: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 8 is connected to node: 9
Node 9 is connected to nodes: 1, 5, 8

With the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the nodes by their number of connections: 
Nodes in order: 8, 2, 0, 3, 6, 9, 5, 7, 1

Now, we count the number of triangles formed:
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 7>.
