Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:

- Node 6 and Node 8 have 1 connection.
- Node 1 and Node 5 have 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9 have 4 connections.
- Node 0 and Node 3 have 5 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree, starting from 0.

- Node 6 ⟶ Node 0
- Node 8 ⟶ Node 1
- Node 1 ⟶ Node 2
- Node 5 ⟶ Node 3
- Node 7 ⟶ Node 4
- Node 2 ⟶ Node 5
- Node 4 ⟶ Node 6
- Node 9 ⟶ Node 7
- Node 0 ⟶ Node 8
- Node 3 ⟶ Node 9

Now, we will check the edges based on the new labeling to count triangles:

1. (0, 2) ⟶ Forms triangle with (0, 4), so <0, 2, 4>.
2. (0, 3) ⟶ No triangles formed.
3. (0, 4) ⟶ No triangles formed.
4. (0, 7) ⟶ Forms triangle with (0, 2), so <0, 2, 7>.
5. (1, 6) ⟶ No triangles formed.
6. (1, 9) ⟶ No triangles formed.
7. (2, 5) ⟶ No triangles formed.
8. (3, 8) ⟶ No triangles formed.
9. (3, 9) ⟶ Forms triangle with (0, 3), so <0, 3, 9>.
10. (4, 9) ⟶ Forms triangle with (0, 4), so <0, 4, 9>.
11. (5, 7) ⟶ No triangles formed.

Hence, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
