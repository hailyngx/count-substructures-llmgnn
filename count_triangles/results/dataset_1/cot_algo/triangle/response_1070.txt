Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their connections in ascending order, we get the following new labels:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 8 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 7 has 4 connections.

Now, we will traverse the edges using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 4): Nodes 0 and 4 do not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 do not form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 7): Nodes 0 and 7 do not form a triangle.
4. Edge (1, 2): Nodes 1 and 2 do not form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 5): Nodes 1 and 5 form a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>.
6. Edge (1, 7): Nodes 1 and 7 do not form a triangle.
7. Edge (1, 8): Nodes 1 and 8 do not form a triangle.
8. Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 do not form a triangle.
9. Edge (2, 6): Nodes 2 and 6 form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 6>.
10. Edge (2, 7): Nodes 2 and 7 form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
11. Edge (3, 6): Nodes 3 and 6 do not form a triangle.
12. Edge (4, 0): Nodes 4 and 0 do not form a triangle.
13. Edge (5, 0): Nodes 5 and 0 do not form a triangle.
14. Edge (5, 1): Nodes 5 and 1 form a triangle with Node 0. Triangle: <0, 1, 5>.
15. Edge (6, 2): Nodes 6 and 2 form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 6>.
16. Edge (6, 3): Nodes 6 and 3 do not form a triangle.
17. Edge (6, 8): Nodes 6 and 8 do not form a triangle.
18. Edge (7, 0): Nodes 7 and 0 do not form a triangle.
19. Edge (7, 1): Nodes 7 and 1 do not form a triangle.
20. Edge (7, 2): Nodes 7 and 2 form a triangle with Node 1. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>.
21. Edge (7, 9): Nodes 7 and 9 do not form a triangle.
22. Edge (8, 1): Nodes 8 and 1 do not form a triangle.
23. Edge (8, 6): Nodes 8 and 6 do not form a triangle.
24. Edge (9, 7): Nodes 9 and 7 do not form a triangle.

The total number of triangles found is 3.
