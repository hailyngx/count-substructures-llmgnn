Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most. Then, we relabel the vertices based on this ordering. 

Here is the original numbering of the vertices with their degrees:
- Vertex 0: Degree 1
- Vertex 1: Degree 1
- Vertex 2: Degree 7
- Vertex 3: Degree 4
- Vertex 4: Degree 3
- Vertex 5: Degree 3
- Vertex 6: Degree 5
- Vertex 7: Degree 1
- Vertex 8: Degree 4
- Vertex 9: Degree 2

After relabeling based on the Degree-Based Ordering:
- Vertex 0 (Degree 1) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 1 (Degree 1) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 (Degree 7) becomes Vertex 9
- Vertex 3 (Degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (Degree 3) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 5 (Degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (Degree 5) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 7 (Degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 8 (Degree 4) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 9 (Degree 2) becomes Vertex 1

Using these new labels, we analyze the edges that satisfy the condition where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

The triangles found in this graph are:
- <4, 8, 2>
- <6, 3, 9>
- <6, 3, 4>
- <6, 3, 5>
- <6, 9, 4>
- <6, 9, 5>
- <6, 4, 8>
- <6, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
