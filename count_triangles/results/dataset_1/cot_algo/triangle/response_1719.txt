Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Degree-Based Ordering:
Vertices sorted by the number of connections: 7, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 3, 9, 2, 8
Relabeled vertices: 
(0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 2) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Triangles:
Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <2, 3, 9>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <2, 8, 9>
