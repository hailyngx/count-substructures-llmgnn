Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 1: 0 connections
Node 6: 1 connection
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections
Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 1 (0 connections) -> A
Node 6 (1 connection) -> B
Node 7 (1 connection) -> C
Node 4 (2 connections) -> D
Node 1 (2 connections) -> E
Node 3 (2 connections) -> F
Node 0 (4 connections) -> G
Node 5 (4 connections) -> H
Node 9 (4 connections) -> I
Node 2 (5 connections) -> J
Now, we will list the triangles formed using the given edges:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
[Total number of triangles: 10]
