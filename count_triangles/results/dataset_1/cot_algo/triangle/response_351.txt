Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 4), (9, 3), (9, 4), (5, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7)

By checking for shared connections, we find the following triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<3, 7, 5>

There are a total of [6] triangles in the given graph.
