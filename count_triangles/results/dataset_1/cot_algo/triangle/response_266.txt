Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method is as follows:
Node 3 has 1 connection
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 9 has 2 connections
Node 2 has 2 connections
Node 5 has 2 connections
Node 0 has 3 connections
Node 2 has 3 connections
Node 9 has 3 connections
Node 1 has 3 connections
Node 7 has 4 connections
Node 4 has 5 connections
  
Since Node 3, 5, and 9 have the least connections, we'll start with their edges:
- Node 3 (1 connection) has edges with Node 0 and there are 2 triangles formed: <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 8>.
- Node 5 (2 connections) has no applicable edges.
- Node 9 (2 connections) also has no applicable edges.
  
Next, we move to Node 2 (3 connections) which has edges with Node 4: <2, 4, 1> and <2, 4, 8>.
  
After that, Node 0 (3 connections) has edges with Node 6: <0, 6, 1> and <0, 6, 8>.
  
Then, Node 2 (3 connections) has edges with Node 7: <2, 7, 6>.
  
Now, Node 9 (3 connections) has an edge with Node 7: <9, 7, 1>.
  
Next, Node 1 (3 connections) has an edge with Node 4: <1, 4, 8>.
  
Finally, Node 7 (4 connections) has multiple edges with Node 8 and Node 9: <7, 8, 6> and <7, 9, 1>.
  
So, the total number of triangles is [10] and the unique triangles are <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <2, 4, 1>, <2, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 6, 8>, <2, 7, 6>, <9, 7, 1>, and <7, 8, 6>.
