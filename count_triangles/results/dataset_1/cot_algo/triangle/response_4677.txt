Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and counting the triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
(8) - 1 connection
(3, 6) - 2 connections
(0, 5, 7) - 3 connections
(1, 4, 9) - 4 connections
(2) - 5 connections

Triangles found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [8]
