Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering for the given graph will be:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 1
Node 7: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 8: degree 4
Node 2: degree 5
Node 1: degree 6
Node 0: degree 6

Using the degree-based ordering, the triangles in the graph are:
[37]
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 1>, <5, 6, 2>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 6>, <8, 9, 0>, <8, 9, 1>, <1, 9, 0>
