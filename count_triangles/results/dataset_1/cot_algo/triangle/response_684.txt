Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most and then labeling them accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices with their respective degrees is as follows:
Vertices: 7(1), 0(2), 3(2), 5(2), 6(2), 9(3), 1(4), 2(4), 4(6), 8(6)

Now, we will count the triangles by considering the edges in the order of vertices specified above.

[Number of triangles: 2]
Unique triangles: <1, 4, 9>, <2, 4, 8>
