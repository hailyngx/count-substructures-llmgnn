Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on the number of connections:

Vertices sorted by the number of connections:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
2 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
3 (degree 3)
9 (degree 4)

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles using the sorted vertices. 

The triangles found are: 
<0, 3, 9> 
<0, 3, 7> 
<0, 4, 5> 
<0, 9, 1> 
<1, 8, 9> 
<2, 4, 6> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
