Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices need to be relabelled based on their number of connections:
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 1 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 0 connections.

Based on the above ordering, we start counting triangles by examining edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge: (0, 1) - Node 0 has connections with Nodes 1, 6, and 9; Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8. Therefore, <0, 1, 8> forms a triangle.

2. Edge: (1, 4) - Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8; Node 4 has connections with Nodes 1 and 7. Therefore, <1, 4, 7> forms a triangle.

3. Edge: (1, 5) - Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8; Node 5 has a connection with Node 1. Therefore, <1, 5, 0> forms a triangle.

4. Edge: (2, 8) - Node 2 has connections with Nodes 8 and 9; Node 8 has connections with Nodes 1, 2, and 7. Therefore, <2, 8, 1> forms a triangle.

5. Edge: (4, 7) - Node 4 has connections with Nodes 1 and 7; Node 7 has connections with Nodes 4 and 8. Therefore, <4, 7, 1> forms a triangle.

6. Edge: (5, 1) - Node 5 has a connection with Node 1; Node 1 has connections with Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8. Therefore, <5, 1, 0> forms a triangle.

Thus, there are [6] triangles in the given graph.
