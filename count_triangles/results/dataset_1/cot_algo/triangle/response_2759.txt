Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: isolated (degree 0)

Now, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 10: 1
- Nodes 4, 8, 9: 2
- Nodes 2, 3, 6: 3
- Nodes 5, 7: 4
- Node 1: 5

Now, we will list the edges based on the relabeled nodes:
- (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7)
- (2, 3) (2, 5)
- (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7)
- (4, 1) (4, 2)
- (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7)
- (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7)
- (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5)
- (8, 1) (8, 2)
- (9, 2) (9, 4)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 5>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
