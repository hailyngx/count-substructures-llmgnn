Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, we get the following relabeling: 

Node 4 -> 0 connections
Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7 -> 1 connection each
Nodes 8, 2, 9 -> 2 connections each
Node 6 -> 4 connections
Node 1 -> 5 connections

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we analyze the edges:

- Edge (0, 2): 0 and 2 share a connection with 1 (Triangle <0, 2, 1>)
- Edge (1, 6): 1 and 6 share a connection with 9 (Triangle <1, 6, 9>)
- Edge (1, 7): 1 and 7 share a connection with 9 (Triangle <1, 7, 9>)
- Edge (1, 9): 1 and 9 share a connection with 6 and 7 (Triangles <1, 9, 6> and <1, 9, 7> respectively)
- Edge (2, 0): 0 and 2 share a connection with 1 (Triangle <2, 0, 1>)
- Edge (3, 6): 3 and 6 do not share a connection
- Edge (5, 6): 5 and 6 share a connection (Triangle <5, 6, 1>)
- Edge (6, 1): already counted when considering edge (1, 6)
- Edge (6, 3): already counted when considering edge (3, 6)
- Edge (6, 5): already counted when considering edge (5, 6)
- Edge (7, 1): already counted when considering edge (1, 7)
- Edge (8, 9): 8 and 9 share a connection with 1 (Triangle <8, 9, 1>)
- Edge (9, 1): already counted when considering edge (1, 9)
- Edge (9, 8): already counted when considering edge (8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 1>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 1>, <2, 0, 1>, and <8, 9, 1>.
