Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 3: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 5: 8 connections

Based on the sorted list, we can now analyze the edges:

1. (0, 5): Node 0 < Node 5, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
2. (1, 8): Node 1 < Node 8, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
3. (2, 5): Node 2 < Node 5, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
4. (2, 9): Node 2 < Node 9, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
5. (4, 5): Node 4 < Node 5, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
6. (5, 0): Not processed as Node 5 has more connections than Node 0
7. (5, 2): Not processed as Node 5 has more connections than Node 2
8. (5, 4): Not processed as Node 5 has more connections than Node 4
9. (5, 7): Node 5 < Node 7, shared connections: {0, 2, 4} (triangle: <0, 2, 4>)
10. (5, 9): Not processed as Node 5 has more connections than Node 9
11. (6, 7): Node 6 < Node 7, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
12. (6, 8): Node 6 < Node 8, shared connections: --- (no triangle)
13. (7, 5): Not processed as Node 7 has more connections than Node 5
14. (7, 6): Not processed as Node 7 has more connections than Node 6
15. (8, 1): Not processed as Node 8 has more connections than Node 1
16. (8, 6): Not processed as Node 8 has more connections than Node 6
17. (9, 2): Not processed as Node 9 has more connections than Node 2
18. (9, 5): Not processed as Node 9 has more connections than Node 5

By counting the triangles formed, we find that there is:
Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 2, 4>
