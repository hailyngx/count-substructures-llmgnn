Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices by their degree, we have the following new labels for the vertices:
Vertices: 1 (degree 1), 5 (degree 1), 4 (degree 1), 6 (degree 0), 0 (degree 4), 3 (degree 4), 9 (degree 4), 2 (degree 5), 8 (degree 6), 7 (degree 4)

Now, we will examine each edge based on the degree ordering:

Edge (1, 2): Both vertices have degree 1, so we proceed. Vertices 1 and 2 share a common neighbor (8), forming a triangle <1, 2, 8>.
Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has degree 1 (less than vertex 3 with degree 4), so we proceed. Vertices 1 and 3 share a common neighbor (8), forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.
Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 has degree 1 (less than vertex 8 with degree 6), so we proceed. Vertices 1 and 8 do not share a common neighbor, no triangle.
Edge (2, 1): Vertex 1 has degree 1 (less than vertex 2 with degree 5), so we proceed. Vertices 2 and 1 share a common neighbor (8), forming a triangle <2, 1, 8>.
Edge (2, 4): Both vertices have degree 1, so we proceed. Vertices 2 and 4 do not share a common neighbor, no triangle.
Edge (2, 8): Vertex 2 has degree 1 (less than vertex 8 with degree 6), so we proceed. Vertices 2 and 8 share a common neighbor (1), forming a triangle <2, 8, 1>.
Edge (2, 9): Both vertices have degree 1, so we proceed. Vertices 2 and 9 do not share a common neighbor, no triangle.
Edge (3, 1): Vertex 1 has degree 1 (less than vertex 3 with degree 4), so we proceed. Vertices 3 and 1 share a common neighbor (8), forming a triangle <3, 1, 8>.
Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has degree 1 (less than vertex 7 with degree 4), so we proceed. Vertices 3 and 7 share a common neighbor (0), forming a triangle <3, 7, 0>.
Edge (3, 9): Vertex 3 has degree 1 (less than vertex 9 with degree 4), so we proceed. Vertices 3 and 9 do not share a common neighbor, no triangle.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

Triangles found: <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 7, 0>.
