Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections in ascending order. The sorted vertices are as follows: 

Vertex 5 <Vertex 9 <Vertex 0 <Vertex 4 <Vertex 3 <Vertex 7 <Vertex 6 <Vertex 8 <Vertex 1 <Vertex 2

Following the method and applying the given edges, we can calculate the total number of triangles and list them as unique triangles:

Total number of triangles: [6]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 2>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 7>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 7>
