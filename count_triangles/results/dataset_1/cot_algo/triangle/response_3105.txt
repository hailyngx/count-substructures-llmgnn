Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are sorted based on their degrees:
Node 0: Degree 1
Node 1: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5

Therefore, the new labels for the vertices are:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
9 -> 2
7 -> 3
4 -> 4
8 -> 5
6 -> 6
5 -> 7
3 -> 8
2 -> 9

Now, we will go through each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled endpoint and count the triangles formed by shared connections:
- Edge (0, 3): Shared connection with node 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 3>
- Edge (1, 5): - 
- Edge (2, 3): - 
- Edge (2, 4): - 
- Edge (2, 6): Shared connection with node 8 -> Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Edge (3, 0): - 
- Edge (3, 2): - 
- Edge (3, 7): - 
- Edge (4, 2): - 
- Edge (4, 5): - 
- Edge (5, 1): - 
- Edge (5, 4): - 
- Edge (5, 7): - 
- Edge (5, 8): Shared connection with node 6 -> Triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 2): Shared connection with node 8 -> Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Edge (6, 8): - 
- Edge (6, 9): - 
- Edge (7, 3): - 
- Edge (7, 5): - 
- Edge (8, 5): Shared connection with node 6 -> Triangle <5, 6, 8>
- Edge (8, 6): - 
- Edge (9, 6): -

After going through all the edges, we find the total number of triangles to be [3].
The unique triangles found in the graph are <0, 2, 3>, <2, 6, 8>, and <5, 6, 8>.
