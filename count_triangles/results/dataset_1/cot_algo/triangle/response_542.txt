Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for this graph is as follows:
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 0 has degree 6

Now, we will consider the edges by following the rule: For each edge, proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

The triangles found are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 6, 9>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <2, 3, 4>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <6, 9, 0>
- <6, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [16].
