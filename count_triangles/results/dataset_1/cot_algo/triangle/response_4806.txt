Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling is: 7, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 0.

Now, we can count the triangles in the graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (8, 1) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (1, 5) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 6) forms a triangle: <2, 0, 6>.
- Edge (6, 3) forms a triangle: <6, 0, 3>.
- Edge (3, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
