Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 4: degree 0
Vertex 9: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 1
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 2
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 6: degree 3
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 7: degree 5
Vertex 0: degree 5

Now, we will count the total number of triangles:
Checking each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

For edge (0, 3): 
Vertex 0 (degree 5) and Vertex 3 (degree 1) share a connection with Vertex 7, forming a triangle <0, 3, 7>.

For edge (0, 7):
Vertex 0 (degree 5) and Vertex 7 (degree 5) share connections with Vertices 5 and 8, forming triangles <0, 7, 5> and <0, 7, 8>.

For edge (0, 8):
Vertex 0 (degree 5) and Vertex 8 (degree 2) share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 8, 5>.

For edge (1, 2):
Vertex 1 (degree 2) and Vertex 2 (degree 2) share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle <1, 2, 5>.

For edge (5, 6):
Vertex 5 (degree 4) and Vertex 6 (degree 3) share connections with Vertices 1 and 7, forming triangles <5, 6, 1> and <5, 6, 7>.

For edge (5, 7):
Vertex 5 (degree 4) and Vertex 7 (degree 5) share connections with Vertices 0, 6, and 8, forming triangles <5, 7, 0>, <5, 7, 6>, and <5, 7, 8>.

For edge (6, 7):
Vertex 6 (degree 3) and Vertex 7 (degree 5) share a connection with Vertex 5, forming a triangle <6, 7, 5>.

For edge (7, 9):
Vertex 7 (degree 5) and Vertex 9 (degree 1) share a connection, but both have more connections than Vertex 4, so no triangle is formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
