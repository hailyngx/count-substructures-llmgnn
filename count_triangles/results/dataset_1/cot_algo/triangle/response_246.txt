Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph with nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Degree-Based Ordering:
1. Sort nodes by their number of connections in ascending order:
   Nodes with connections: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
   Nodes without connections: 0, 3, 6

2. Relabel the nodes:
   0 -> 1, 1 -> 4, 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 6 -> 9, 7 -> 2, 8 -> 3, 9 -> 5

Unique triangles found:
<1, 3, 0>, <1, 6, 0>, <1, 7, 0>, <4, 3, 1>, <4, 6, 0>, <4, 8, 6>, <4, 7, 3>, <8, 6, 4>, <8, 9, 6>, <8, 9, 5>, <9, 6, 0>

Total number of triangles: [11]
