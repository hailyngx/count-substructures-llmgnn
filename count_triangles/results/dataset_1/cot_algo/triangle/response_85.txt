Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices based on their degree of connections. 

The vertices with their respective degrees are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 5
- Vertex 2: degree 1
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 4
- Vertex 6: degree 4
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 3
- Vertex 9: degree 6

Vertices in increasing order of degrees: 2, 4, 3, 7, 0, 8, 5, 6, 1, 9

By following the method where we only consider edges between vertices where the one with the smaller label has fewer connections, we find the triangles in the graph:

1. Triangles involving vertex 0: <0, 1, 5>, <0, 5, 9>
2. Triangles involving vertex 1: <1, 5, 9>
3. Triangles involving vertex 5: <5, 9, 6>
4. Triangles involving vertex 6: <6, 9, 8>

Total number of triangles: [4]
