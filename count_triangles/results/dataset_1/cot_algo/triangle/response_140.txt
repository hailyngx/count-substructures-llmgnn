Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 4 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 0 
Node 3 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 1 
Node 7 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 2 
Node 8 (degree 2) -> relabeled as Node 3 
Node 0 (degree 3) -> relabeled as Node 4 
Node 5 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Node 5 
Node 9 (degree 4) -> relabeled as Node 6 
Node 2 (degree 5) -> relabeled as Node 7 
Node 6 (degree 6) -> relabeled as Node 8 
Node 1 (degree 6) -> relabeled as Node 9 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the number of triangles.

Total number of triangles: [8]

Unique triangles found:
