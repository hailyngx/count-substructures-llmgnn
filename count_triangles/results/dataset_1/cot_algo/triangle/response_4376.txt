Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:
Nodes in sorted order with their respective degrees: 
1. Node 4 (degree 1)
2. Node 5 (degree 1)
3. Node 3 (degree 2)
4. Node 1 (degree 3)
5. Node 5 (degree 3)
6. Node 0 (degree 5)
7. Node 6 (degree 4)
8. Node 2 (degree 5)
9. Node 7 (degree 5)
10. Node 8 (degree 6)

Let's start counting the triangles:
- For Node 4: No triangles can be formed as it has only 1 connection.
- For Node 5: No triangles can be formed as it has only 1 connection.
- For Node 3: No triangles can be formed as it has 2 connections.
- For Node 1: No triangles can be formed as it has 3 connections.
- For Node 5: No triangles can be formed as it has 3 connections.
- For Node 0: <0, 1, 8> (Forming a triangle with nodes 1 and 8).
- For Node 6: <0, 6, 7> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 7).
- For Node 2: <0, 2, 8> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 8).
- For Node 7: <0, 6, 7> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 6).
- For Node 8: <0, 1, 8> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 1), <0, 2, 8> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 2).
- For Node 9: <0, 6, 9> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 6), <0, 8, 9> (Forming a triangle with nodes 0 and 8).

Total number of triangles: [6]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 8, 9>.
