Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 1 connection
- Vertex 7 has 1 connection
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections
- Vertex 2 has 3 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 4 connections
- Vertex 8 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 5 connections
- Vertex 5 has 6 connections

Using the degree-based ordering method to count triangles, we find that there are:
- Total number of triangles: [13]
- Unique triangles: <0, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 0>, <2, 7, 4>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 5>, <4, 5, 8>
