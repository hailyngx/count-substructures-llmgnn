Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labeling is as follows:
Vertices: 1 (degree 2), 6 (degree 3), 0 (degree 3), 5 (degree 3), 8 (degree 3), 7 (degree 4), 4 (degree 4), 3 (degree 5), 2 (degree 6), 9 (degree 8).

Now, we will count the triangles by following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 2): Vertex 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 2 (degree 6). Shared connections are with vertices 6 and 7 forming triangle <0, 2, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 6 (degree 3). No triangles are formed.
3. Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 8 (degree 3). No triangles are formed.
4. Edge (1, 9): Vertex 1 (degree 2) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 8). No triangles are formed.
5. Edge (2, 0): Skipped because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 0.
6. Edge (2, 3): Vertex 2 (degree 6) has fewer connections than vertex 3 (degree 5). Shared connections are with vertices 4 and 9 forming triangle <2, 3, 4>.
7. Edge (2, 4): Skipped because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 4.
8. Edge (2, 5): Skipped because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 5.
9. Edge (2, 9): Skipped because vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 9.
10. Edge (3, 2): Skipped because vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 2.
11. Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 (degree 5) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (degree 3). No triangles are formed.
12. Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 (degree 5) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4). Shared connections are with vertices 4 and 9 forming triangle <3, 7, 4>.
13. Edge (3, 9): Skipped because vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 9.
14. Edge (4, 2): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 2.
15. Edge (4, 7): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 7.
16. Edge (4, 8): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 8.
17. Edge (4, 9): Skipped because vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 9.
18. Edge (5, 2): Skipped because vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 2.
19. Edge (5, 3): Skipped because vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 3.
20. Edge (5, 8): Skipped because vertex 5 has more connections than vertex 8.
21. Edge (6, 0): Vertex 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 0 (degree 3). No triangles are formed.
22. Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 7 (degree 4). No triangles are formed.
23. Edge (6, 9): Vertex 6 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 9 (degree 8). Shared connections are with vertices 7 and 0 forming triangle <6, 9, 7>.
24. Edge (7, 3): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 3.
25. Edge (7, 4): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 4.
26. Edge (7, 6): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 6.
27. Edge (7, 9): Skipped because vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 9.
28. Edge (8, 1): Vertex 8 (degree 3) has fewer connections than vertex 1 (degree 2). No triangles are formed.
29. Edge (8, 4): Skipped because vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 4.
30. Edge (8, 5): Skipped because vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 5.
31. Edge (8, 9): Skipped because vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 9.
32. Edge (9, 1): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 1.
33. Edge (9, 2): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 2.
34. Edge (9, 3): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 3.
35. Edge (9, 4): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 4.
36. Edge (9, 6): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 6.
37. Edge (9, 7): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 7.
38. Edge (9, 8): Skipped because vertex 9 has more connections than vertex 8.

The total number of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 6>, <2, 3, 4>, and <6, 9, 7>.
