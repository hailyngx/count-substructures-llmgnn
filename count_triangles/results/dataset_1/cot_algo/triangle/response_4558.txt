Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 5: Degree 2
Nodes 1, 7, 4, 2, 6, 8: Degree 2
Nodes 0, 9, 3: Degree 5

Following the rule of starting with the edge connected to the lower-degree vertex, we can analyze the edges:

1. (0, 3): Forms triangle with node 2 <0, 2, 3>
2. (0, 4): Does not form a triangle
3. (0, 7): Does not form a triangle
4. (1, 4): Does not form a triangle
5. (2, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8 <0, 2, 3>
6. (2, 8): Does not form a triangle
7. (3, 0): Forms triangle with node 2 <0, 2, 3>
8. (3, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 8 <0, 2, 3>
9. (3, 6): Does not form a triangle
10. (3, 8): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2 <0, 2, 3>
11. (3, 9): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6 <0, 3, 6>
12. (4, 0): Does not form a triangle
13. (4, 1): Does not form a triangle
14. (5, 8): Does not form a triangle
15. (5, 9): Does not form a triangle
16. (6, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 9 <0, 3, 6>
17. (6, 9): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 3 <0, 3, 6>
18. (7, 0): Does not form a triangle
19. (7, 9): Does not form a triangle
20. (8, 2): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 3 <0, 2, 3>
21. (8, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 2 <0, 2, 3>
22. (8, 5): Does not form a triangle
23. (9, 3): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 6 <0, 3, 6>
24. (9, 5): Does not form a triangle
25. (9, 6): Forms triangle with nodes 0 and 3 <0, 3, 6>
26. (9, 7): Does not form a triangle

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
