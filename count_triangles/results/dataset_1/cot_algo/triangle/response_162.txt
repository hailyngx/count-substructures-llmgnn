Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degree (number of connections) in ascending order and then relabeling the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is as follows:
Vertices: 1, 0, 8, 6, 9, 5, 2, 4, 7, 3

Next, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles using the specified method. 

Upon examination of the edges, we find the following triangles:

<1, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 5>
<6, 9, 2>
<6, 9, 4>
<6, 2, 3>
<6, 2, 9>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
