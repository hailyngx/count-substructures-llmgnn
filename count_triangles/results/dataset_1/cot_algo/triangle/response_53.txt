Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following labels for each vertex:
Vertex 3 (Degree = 2)
Vertex 5 (Degree = 1)
Vertex 8 (Degree = 2)
Vertex 1 (Degree = 3)
Vertex 7 (Degree = 3)
Vertex 0 (Degree = 5)
Vertex 6 (Degree = 4)
Vertex 4 (Degree = 5)
Vertex 2 (Degree = 4)
Vertex 9 (Degree = 6)

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Using this method, we can identify the total number of triangles and the unique triangles:
Total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 8>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 3, 9>
