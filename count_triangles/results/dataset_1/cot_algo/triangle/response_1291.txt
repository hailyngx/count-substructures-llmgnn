Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles involves sorting vertices by their degree (number of connections). Then, we relabel the vertices accordingly and count triangles based on shared connections.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, the degrees of each node are:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Sorting the nodes by degrees, we get: 7, 3, 5, 8, 9, 6, 0, 4, 1, 2.

Now, let's check each edge while ensuring the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 and Node 1 share connections with Node 4 forming triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (0, 3): No triangle is formed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Edge (0, 4): Triangle <0, 1, 4>.
- Edge (0, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (0, 9): Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
- Edge (1, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (1, 2): Triangle <1, 2, 4>.
- Edge (1, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (1, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (1, 9): Triangle <1, 4, 9>.
- Edge (2, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (2, 4): Already counted.
- Edge (2, 5): Triangle <2, 5, 9>.
- Edge (2, 7): No triangle is formed as Node 7 has fewer connections.
- Edge (2, 8): No triangle is formed as Node 8 has fewer connections.
- Edge (2, 9): Already counted.
- Edge (3, 0): No triangle is formed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Edge (3, 4): No triangle is formed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Edge (3, 8): No triangle is formed as Node 8 has fewer connections.
- Edge (4, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (4, 3): No triangle is formed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Edge (4, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (5, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (5, 6): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (5, 9): No triangle is formed as Node 9 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 0): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 1): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 4): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (6, 5): No triangle is formed as Node 6 has more connections.
- Edge (7, 2): No triangle is formed as Node 7 has fewer connections.
- Edge (7, 8): No triangle is formed as Node 7 has fewer connections.
- Edge (8, 2): No triangle is formed as Node 8 has fewer connections.
- Edge (8, 3): No triangle is formed as Node 3 has fewer connections.
- Edge (8, 7): No triangle is formed as Node 7 has fewer connections.
- Edge (9, 0): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 1): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 2): Already counted.
- Edge (9, 5): No triangle is formed as Node 5 has fewer connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 2, 4>, <2, 5, 9>.
