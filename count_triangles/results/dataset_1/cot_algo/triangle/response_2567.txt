Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we get the following order: 

Vertices: 1, 5, 8, 9, 3, 2, 6, 7, 4, 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we analyze the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1) can form a triangle with 0-2, resulting in triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2) already forms a triangle with 0-1, so no new triangle is counted.
- Edge (0, 4) can form triangles with 0-6 and 0-8, resulting in triangles <0, 4, 6> and <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (0, 6) can form triangles with 0-4, 0-8, and 0-9, resulting in triangles <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, and <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (0, 8) can form a triangle with 0-6, resulting in triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (1, 0) already counted as part of triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (2, 0) already counted as part of triangle <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (2, 3) can form a triangle with 2-4, resulting in triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (2, 4) already counted as part of triangles <0, 1, 2> and <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (3, 2) already counted as part of triangle <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (3, 7) can form a triangle with 3-4, resulting in triangle <3, 7, 4>.
- Edge (3, 8) can form a triangle with 3-4, resulting in triangle <3, 8, 4>.
- Edge (4, 0) already counted as part of triangles <0, 1, 2>, <0, 4, 6>, and <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (4, 2) already counted as part of triangles <0, 1, 2> and <2, 3, 4>.
- Edge (4, 5) can form a triangle with 4-6, resulting in triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (4, 6) already counted as part of triangles <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, and <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (4, 7) can form triangles with 4-6 and 4-9, resulting in triangles <4, 7, 6> and <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (4, 9) already counted as part of triangle <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (5, 4) already counted as part of triangle <4, 5, 6>.
- Edge (6, 0) already counted as part of triangles <0, 4, 6>, <0, 6, 8>, and <0, 6, 9>.
- Edge (6, 4) already counted as part of triangles <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>, and <4, 7, 6>.
- Edge (6, 7) can form a triangle with 6-9, resulting in triangle <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (6, 9) already counted as part of triangles <0, 6, 9>, <4, 7, 9>, and <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 3) already counted as part of triangle <3, 7, 4>.
- Edge (7, 4) already counted as part of triangles <3, 7, 4> and <4, 7, 6>.
- Edge (7, 6) already counted as part of triangle <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (7, 9) already counted as part of triangles <4, 7, 9> and <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (8, 0) already counted as part of triangle <0, 4, 8>.
- Edge (8, 3) already counted as part of triangle <3, 8, 4>.
- Edge (9, 4) already counted as part of triangle <4, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 6) already counted as part of triangles <0, 6, 9> and <6, 7, 9>.
- Edge (9, 7) already counted as part of triangle <6, 7, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
