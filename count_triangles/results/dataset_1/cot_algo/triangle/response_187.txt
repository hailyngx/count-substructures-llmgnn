Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph.  
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 5 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 7 (Degree 2)    
Vertex 8 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 9 (Degree 2)  
Vertex 1 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 2 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 6 (Degree 4)  
Vertex 3 (Degree 5)  
Vertex 4 (Degree 5)

Calculating the triangles formed by the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with vertices 1, 2, 7
2. Edge (1, 3) forms a triangle with vertices 1, 3, 4
3. Edge (2, 4) forms a triangle with vertices 2, 4, 8
4. Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with vertices 3, 6, 9
5. Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertices 3, 6, 9

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 8>, <3, 6, 9>.
