Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices should be relabeled as follows:
- Node 8 has 0 connections.
- Nodes 2 and 5 have 1 connection each.
- Nodes 7 and 0 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 1 and 4 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 5 connections each.
  
Now, examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

1. Edge (1, 2):
    Node 2 has 1 connection: 3
    Shared connections with node 2: None
    
2. Edge (1, 4):
    Node 4 has 4 connections: 6, 7, 9, 6
    Shared connections with node 4: 6, 9
    Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
    
3. Edge (1, 5):
    Node 5 has 1 connection: 6
    Shared connections with node 5: None
    
4. Edge (1, 7):
    Node 7 has 2 connections: 4, 1
    Shared connections with node 7: 1
    Triangle: <1, 4, 7>
    
5. Edge (1, 9):
    Node 9 has 4 connections: 3, 4, 6, 3
    Shared connections with node 9: 3, 4, 6
    Triangles: <1, 4, 9>, <1, 6, 9>
    
6. Edge (2, 3):
    Node 3 has 5 connections: 2, 6, 9, 2, 6
    Shared connections with node 3: 2, 6
    Triangle: <2, 3, 6>
    
7. Edge (3, 6):
    Node 6 has 5 connections: 3, 4, 5, 9, 3
    Shared connections with node 6: 3, 9
    Triangle: <1, 6, 9>
    
8. Edge (4, 6):
    Node 6 has 5 connections: 3, 4, 5, 9, 3
    Shared connections with node 6: 4, 9
    Triangle: <1, 4, 6>
    
Total number of triangles: [5]
