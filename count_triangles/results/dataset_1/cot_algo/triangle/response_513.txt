Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 8: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we now analyze the edges:

(0, 3): Forms a triangle with node 5 <0, 3, 5>
(0, 5): Does not form a triangle
(1, 7): Does not form a triangle
(1, 8): Forms a triangle with node 9 <1, 8, 9>
(1, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 4 <1, 9, 4> and <1, 9, 8>
(2, 3): Forms a triangle with node 5 <2, 3, 5>
(2, 5): Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9 <2, 5, 6> and <2, 5, 9>
(2, 8): Forms a triangle with node 6 <2, 8, 6>
(3, 7): Does not form a triangle
(3, 2): Forms a triangle with node 5 <3, 2, 5>
(3, 7): Does not form a triangle
(4, 9): Forms a triangle with node 6 <4, 9, 6>
(5, 0): Does not form a triangle
(5, 2): Forms a triangle with nodes 6 and 9 <5, 2, 6> and <5, 2, 9>
(5, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 9 <5, 6, 2> and <5, 6, 9>
(5, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 6 <5, 9, 1>,<5, 9, 2> and <5, 9, 6>
(6, 5): Does not form a triangle
(6, 8): Forms a triangle with node 9 <6, 8, 9>
(6, 9): Forms a triangle with nodes 1, 4, and 5 <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 4> and <6, 9, 5>
(7, 1): Does not form a triangle
(7, 3): Does not form a triangle
(8, 1): Forms a triangle with node 9 <8, 1, 9>
(8, 2): Forms a triangle with node 6 <8, 2, 6>
(8, 6): Forms a triangle with node 9 <8, 6, 9>
(9, 1): Forms a triangle with nodes 8 and 4 <9, 1, 8> and <9, 1, 4>
(9, 4): Does not form a triangle
(9, 5): Forms a triangle with node 6 <9, 5, 6>
(9, 6): Forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5 <9, 6, 1> and <9, 6, 5>

Total number of triangles: [17]
