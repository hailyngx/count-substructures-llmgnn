Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degrees as follows:
0 -> 2 connections
3 -> 1 connection
4 -> 3 connections
1 -> 3 connections
6 -> 3 connections
2 -> 3 connections
8 -> 3 connections
5 -> 4 connections
9 -> 4 connections
7 -> 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles by examining each edge according to the rules mentioned in the prompt:
1. (0, 1) - No triangle forms.
2. (0, 5) - Triangle <0, 5, 2>.
3. (1, 0) - No triangle forms.
4. (1, 4) - No triangle forms.
5. (1, 9) - No triangle forms.
6. (2, 5) - Triangle <2, 5, 6>.
7. (2, 6) - No triangle forms.
8. (2, 8) - No triangle forms.
9. (3, 5) - No triangle forms.
10. (4, 1) - No triangle forms.
11. (4, 7) - No triangle forms.
12. (4, 9) - Triangle <4, 9, 1>.
13. (5, 0) - No triangle forms.
14. (5, 2) - Triangle <5, 2, 6>.
15. (5, 3) - No triangle forms.
16. (6, 2) - No triangle forms.
17. (6, 7) - No triangle forms.
18. (6, 8) - No triangle forms.
19. (7, 4) - No triangle forms.
20. (7, 6) - Triangle <7, 6, 8>.
21. (7, 9) - No triangle forms.
22. (8, 2) - No triangle forms.
23. (8, 6) - No triangle forms.
24. (8, 9) - Triangle <8, 9, 4>.
25. (9, 1) - No triangle forms.
26. (9, 4) - Triangle <9, 4, 1>.
27. (9, 7) - No triangle forms.
28. (9, 8) - Triangle <9, 8, 4>.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <0, 5, 2>, <4, 9, 1>, <5, 2, 6>, <7, 6, 8>, <8, 9, 4>
