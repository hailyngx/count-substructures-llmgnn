Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles in the given graph efficiently. 

The sorted vertices based on their degrees (number of connections) are:
Vertex 0 - 2 connections
Vertex 1 - 3 connections
Vertex 4 - 3 connections
Vertex 7 - 3 connections
Vertex 9 - 3 connections
Vertex 3 - 4 connections
Vertex 5 - 4 connections
Vertex 6 - 4 connections
Vertex 8 - 6 connections
Vertex 2 - 7 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start with edges connected to vertices with the fewest connections.

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 1):
Vertices 0 and 1 have a shared connection with vertex 2, forming a triangle <0, 1, 2>.

For edge (1, 3):
Vertices 1 and 3 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.

Vertices 1 and 4 have a shared connection with vertex 6, forming a triangle <1, 4, 6>.

Vertices 0 and 2 have a shared connection with vertex 5, forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
