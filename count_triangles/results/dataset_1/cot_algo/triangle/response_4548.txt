Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we get the following order: 

Node 3 (degree 1)  
Node 5 (degree 1)  
Node 9 (degree 2)  
Node 0 (degree 3)  
Node 2 (degree 3)  
Node 6 (degree 3)  
Node 8 (degree 3)  
Node 1 (degree 5)  
Node 4 (degree 5)  
Node 7 (degree 5)  

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will count the triangles formed in the graph:

- Analyzing the edge (0, 1):  
Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 6.  
Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.  
Shared connections between nodes 0 and 1 are nodes 7 and 8, forming the triangle: <0, 1, 7> and <0, 1, 8>.  

- Analyzing the edge (0, 6):  
Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 6.  
Node 6 connects to nodes 0 and 4.  
Since Node 6 has fewer connections, we proceed.  
Shared connection between nodes 0 and 6 is Node 4, forming the triangle: <0, 6, 4>.  

- Analyzing the edge (1, 2):  
Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.  
Node 2 connects to nodes 1 and 4.  
Since Node 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.  
Shared connection between nodes 1 and 2 is Node 4, forming the triangle: <1, 2, 4>.  

- Analyzing the edge (1, 7):  
Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.  
Node 7 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 9.  
Shared connection between nodes 1 and 7 is Node 0, forming the triangle: <1, 7, 0>.  

- Analyzing the edge (1, 8):  
Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.  
Node 8 connects to nodes 1 and 4.  
Since Node 8 has fewer connections, we proceed.  
Shared connection between nodes 1 and 8 is Node 0, forming the triangle: <1, 8, 0>.  

- Proceeding with other edges, we find no additional triangles.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
