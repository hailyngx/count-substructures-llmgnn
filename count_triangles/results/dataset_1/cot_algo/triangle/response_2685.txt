Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices based on their number of connections are: 
Nodes and their connections: 
3: 2 connections
0: 3 connections
7: 3 connections
2: 4 connections
9: 4 connections
1: 5 connections
6: 5 connections
8: 5 connections
4: 6 connections
5: 7 connections

Now, we will count the number of triangles:
