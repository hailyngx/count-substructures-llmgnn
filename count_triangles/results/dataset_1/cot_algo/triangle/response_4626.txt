Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph with Degree-Based Ordering:
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 8 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 0, 7, 9 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 1, 2 have 5 connections each.

Triangles found:
- <1, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 8, 2>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <4, 7, 9>

Total number of triangles: [5]
