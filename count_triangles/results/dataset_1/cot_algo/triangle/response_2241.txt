Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 7 with 1 connection
Node 5 with 1 connection
Node 6 with 2 connections
Node 8 with 2 connections
Node 4 with 3 connections
Node 2 with 3 connections
Node 1 with 4 connections
Node 9 with 4 connections
Node 3 with 4 connections
Node 0 with 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles formed in the graph:
- Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
