Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph with vertices sorted by their number of connections:
Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 7

Triangles found:
<0, 6, 9> 

Total number of triangles: [1]
