Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices are relabeled as follows based on the number of connections:
- Vertex 0: 3 connections
- Vertex 1: 1 connection
- Vertex 2: 2 connections
- Vertex 3: 2 connections
- Vertex 4: 4 connections
- Vertex 5: 2 connections
- Vertex 6: 5 connections
- Vertex 7: 4 connections
- Vertex 8: 1 connection
- Vertex 9: 5 connections

Using the relabeled vertices, we can identify the triangles in the graph as follows:
- Triangle 1: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 6, 9>
- Triangle 3: <0, 7, 9>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <3, 7, 9>
- Triangle 7: <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle 8: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 9: <4, 7, 9>
- Triangle 10: <6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
