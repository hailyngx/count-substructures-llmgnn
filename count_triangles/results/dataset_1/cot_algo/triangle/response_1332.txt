Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labeling is as follows:  

Node 8 is connected to 1 node(s).
Node 4 is connected to 2 node(s).
Node 7 is connected to 3 node(s).
Node 2 is connected to 4 node(s).
Node 6 is connected to 5 node(s).
Node 1 is connected to 5 node(s).
Node 9 is connected to 5 node(s).
Node 5 is connected to 6 node(s).
Node 0 is connected to 6 node(s).
Node 3 is connected to 7 node(s).

Using the degree-based ordering method, we will now count the triangles:  

1. Edge (0, 3): The shared connections are 1, 2, and 7. Triangle formed <0, 2, 3>.
2. Edge (0, 7): The shared connections are 1 and 3. Triangle formed <0, 1, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 3): The shared connections are 2 and 7. Triangle formed <1, 2, 3>.
5. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (2, 3): The shared connection is 1. No triangle formed.
8. Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (3, 0): The shared connections are 1, 2, and 7. Triangle formed <0, 2, 3>.
10. Edge (3, 1): The shared connections are 2 and 7. Triangle formed <1, 2, 3>.
11. Edge (3, 2): The shared connection is 1. No triangle formed.
12. Edge (3, 7): The shared connection is 0. No triangle formed.
13. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (4, 6): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (5, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (5, 4): No triangle formed.
17. Edge (5, 6): No triangle formed.
18. Edge (5, 8): No triangle formed.
19. Edge (5, 9): No triangle formed.
20. Edge (6, 1): No triangle formed.
21. Edge (6, 4): No triangle formed.
22. Edge (6, 5): No triangle formed.
23. Edge (7, 0): The shared connections are 1 and 3. Triangle formed <0, 1, 7>.
24. Edge (7, 1): No triangle formed.
25. Edge (7, 3): The shared connection is 0. No triangle formed.
26. Edge (8, 5): No triangle formed.
27. Edge (9, 0): No triangle formed.
28. Edge (9, 5): No triangle formed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 3>.
