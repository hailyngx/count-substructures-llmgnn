Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 2: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertices 1 and 8: 2 connections
Vertices 4, 6, and 9: 3 connections
Vertices 0, 3, 5, and 7: 4 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Both vertices have 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (0, 6): Vertex 0 has 4 connections, and Vertex 6 has 3 connections:
  - Shared connections: 7
- Edge (0, 7): Both vertices have 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (1, 3): Both vertices have 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has 4 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 has 4 connections, and Vertex 5 has 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (3, 7): Vertex 3 has 4 connections, and Vertex 7 has 4 connections, so we do not proceed.
- Edge (4, 7): Vertex 4 has 3 connections, and Vertex 7 has 4 connections:
  - Shared connections: 0
- Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has 4 connections, and Vertex 8 has 3 connections:
  - Shared connections: 6

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7> and <4, 0, 7>.
