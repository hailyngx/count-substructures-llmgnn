Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to re-label the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order.  
The degree of each vertex is as follows:  
Vertex 0: Degree 2  
Vertex 1: Degree 4  
Vertex 2: Degree 2  
Vertex 3: Degree 2  
Vertex 4: Degree 4  
Vertex 5: Degree 1  
Vertex 6: Degree 1  
Vertex 7: Degree 3  
Vertex 8: Degree 4  
Vertex 9: Degree 3  

Based on the degree-based ordering, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Vertex 0 -> 5  
Vertex 1 -> 6  
Vertex 2 -> 7  
Vertex 3 -> 8  
Vertex 4 -> 9  
Vertex 5 -> 0  
Vertex 6 -> 1  
Vertex 7 -> 2  
Vertex 8 -> 3  
Vertex 9 -> 4  

Now, we will list the edges based on the new labels and count the triangles:

Edges based on new labels:  
(5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by the shared connections:  
Triangles:  
<2, 4, 9>  
<1, 4, 7>  

Total number of triangles: [2]
