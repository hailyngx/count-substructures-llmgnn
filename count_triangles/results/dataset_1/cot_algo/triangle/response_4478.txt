Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the nodes are:  
Node 3 (Degree 1)  
Node 1 (Degree 1)  
Node 5 (Degree 1)  
Node 7 (Degree 1)  
Node 0 (Degree 4)  
Node 4 (Degree 4)  
Node 8 (Degree 4)  
Node 9 (Degree 4)  
Node 2 (Degree 5)  
Node 6 (Degree 5)  

Now, we will count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Process the edges starting from edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections.

Triangles:
1. <0, 2, 4>
2. <0, 2, 6>
3. <0, 6, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
