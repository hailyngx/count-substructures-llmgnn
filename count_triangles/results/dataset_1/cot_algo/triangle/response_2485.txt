Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 7: 0 connections  
Node 4: 0 connections  
Node 0: 1 connection  
Node 2: 1 connection  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 8: 2 connections  
Node 1: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 9: 6 connections  
Node 6: 6 connections  

Now, let's count the triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
