Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices can be relabeled as follows:
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections
- Vertex 6 has 2 connections
- Vertex 9 has 2 connections
- Vertex 4 has 3 connections
- Vertex 7 has 4 connections
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections
- Vertex 1 has 5 connections
- Vertex 8 has 5 connections
- Vertex 0 has 6 connections

Looking at the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with shared connection 1
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with shared connection 1
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with shared connection 1
- Edge (3, 8) forms a triangle with shared connection 8

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4], and the unique triangles found are <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 9>, <1, 7, 9>, and <3, 8, 4>.
