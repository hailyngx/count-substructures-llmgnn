Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order, we get the following labels:
Vertices: 8, 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 2, 3, 0, 9

Now, we will count the number of triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and Vertex 3 has 5 connections. As 0 < 3 and 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  Shared connections of vertices 0 and 3: 5
  Triangle(s) formed: <0, 3, 5>

- Edge (0, 5): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and Vertex 5 has 3 connections. As 0 < 5 and both vertices have equal connections, we proceed.
  Shared connections of vertices 0 and 5: None

- Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 has 3 connections and Vertex 9 has 5 connections. As 0 < 9 and 9 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  Shared connections of vertices 0 and 9: 5
  Triangle(s) formed: <0, 9, 5>

- Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 has 2 connections and Vertex 2 has 4 connections. As 1 < 2 and 2 has fewer connections, we proceed.
  Shared connections of vertices 1 and 2: None

- Rest of the edges do not form triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5> and <0, 9, 5>.
