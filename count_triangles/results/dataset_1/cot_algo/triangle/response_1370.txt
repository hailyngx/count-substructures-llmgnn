Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method requires us to sort the vertices based on their number of connections. The sorted order is: 6, 1, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 9, 0, 8.

Now, let's calculate the triangles formed based on the given edges:

For the vertex 6: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 1: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 4: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 5: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 7: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 2: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 3: Triangles: <5, 3, 8> , <0, 2, 3>
For the vertex 9: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 0: No triangles can be formed with this vertex.
For the vertex 8: Triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
Unique triangles found in the graph: <5, 3, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <7, 8, 9>.
