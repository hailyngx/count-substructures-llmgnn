Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections.

Based on the given edge list, the sorted list of vertices with the number of connections is as follows:
0 (1 connection)
3 (1 connection)
8 (1 connection)
7 (0 connection)
2 (2 connections)
9 (3 connections)
4 (4 connections)
6 (5 connections)
5 (6 connections)
1 (7 connections)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. (0, 1):
    - Shared neighbors: None
2. (1, 0): (Already counted)
3. (1, 2):
    - Shared neighbors: None
4. (1, 5):
    - Shared neighbors: None
5. (1, 6):
    - Shared neighbors: None
6. (1, 9):
    - Shared neighbors: None
7. (2, 1): (Already counted)
8. (2, 5):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 2, 5>
9. (2, 6):
    - Shared neighbors: None
10. (3, 4):
    - Shared neighbors: None
11. (3, 5):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 3, 5>
12. (3, 6):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 3, 6>
13. (4, 3): (Already counted)
14. (4, 5):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 4, 5>
15. (4, 6):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 4, 6>
16. (4, 9):
    - Shared neighbors: None
17. (5, 1): (Already counted)
18. (5, 2): (Already counted)
19. (5, 3): (Already counted)
20. (5, 4): (Already counted)
21. (5, 9):
    - Shared neighbors: 1
       - Triangle <1, 5, 9>
22. (6, 1): (Already counted)
23. (6, 2): (Already counted)
24. (6, 3): (Already counted)
25. (6, 4): (Already counted)
26. (6, 8):
    - Shared neighbors: None
27. (8, 6): (Already counted)
28. (9, 1): (Already counted)
29. (9, 4): (Already counted)
30. (9, 5): (Already counted)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5]. The unique triangles found are <1, 2, 5>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 4, 5>, and <1, 5, 9>.
