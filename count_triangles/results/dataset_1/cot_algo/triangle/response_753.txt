Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 5: 5 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 8: 6 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now analyze the edges in the graph. 
Starting with the edge involving the vertex with the lowest label and fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 3):
    - Node 0 and Node 3 share a connection.
    - Potential triangle: (0, 3, x)
    
2. Edge (0, 8):
    - Node 0 and Node 8 share a connection.
    - Potential triangle: (0, 8, x)
    
3. Edge (1, 2):
    - Node 1 and Node 2 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
4. Edge (1, 4):
    - Node 1 and Node 4 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.

    - Node 4 and Node 6 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
13. Edge (4, 9):
    - Node 4 and Node 9 share a connection.
    - <2, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    
14. Edge (5, 3):
    - Node 5 and Node 3 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
15. Edge (5, 7):
    - Node 5 and Node 7 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
16. Edge (5, 8):

    - Potential triangle: (5, 9, x)
    
18. Edge (6, 1):
    - Node 6 and Node 1 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
19. Edge (6, 4):
    - Node 6 and Node 4 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
20. Edge (7, 2):
    - Node 7 and Node 2 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
21. Edge (7, 5):
    - Node 7 and Node 5 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
22. Edge (7, 8):
    - Node 7 and Node 8 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
23. Edge (8, 0):
    - Node 8 and Node 0 share a connection.
    - Potential triangle: (0, 8, x)
    
24. Edge (8, 2):
    - Node 8 and Node 2 share a connection.
    - Potential triangle: (2, 8, x)
    
25. Edge (8, 5):
    - Node 8 and Node 5 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
26. Edge (8, 7):
    - Node 8 and Node 7 do not share a connection. Proceed to the next edge.
    
27. Edge (8, 9):
    - Node 8 and Node 9 share a connection.
    - <2, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    
28. Edge (9, 2):
    - Node 9 and Node 2 share a connection.
    - Potential triangle: (2, 9, x)
    
29. Edge (9, 4):
    - Node 9 and Node 4 share a connection.
    - <2, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    
30. Edge (9, 5):
    - Node 9 and Node 5 share a connection.
    - <5, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    
31. Edge (9, 8):
    - Node 9 and Node 8 share a connection.
    - <2, 8, 9> is a triangle.
    

After analyzing all edges, we have found the following unique triangles:
<2, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
