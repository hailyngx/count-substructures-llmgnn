Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by the number of connections they have. In this case, the sorted order of vertices based on their degrees is:
(9) 1 connection: 8, 9
(4) 2 connections: 1, 6
(3) 3 connections: 2
(5) 4 connections: 5
(4) 5 connections: 7
(8) 6 connections: 4
(8) 7 connections: 0
(6) 8 connections: 3

Now, we will go through the edges in the order specified and count the triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 3): 0(7) - 3(8)
   Shared connections: (2)
   Triangle formed: <0, 2, 3>

2. Edge (0, 4): 0(7) - 4(6)
   Shared connections: (1, 2)
   Triangle formed: Not applicable (the shared connections already formed a triangle)

3. Edge (0, 5): 0(7) - 5(4)
   Shared connections: (3)
   Triangle formed: <0, 3, 5>

4. Edge (0, 8): 0(7) - 8(1)
   Shared connections: Not applicable
   No triangle formed

5. Edge (0, 9): 0(7) - 9(1)

    Shared connections: Not applicable
    No triangle formed

15. Edge (3, 5): 3(8) - 5(4)
    Shared connections: (0)
    Triangle formed: Not applicable (already counted)

    Triangle formed: Not applicable (already counted)

21. Edge (5, 3): 5(4) - 3(8)
    Shared connections: (0)
    Triangle formed: Not applicable (already counted)

22. Edge (5, 6): 5(4) - 6(2)
    Shared connections: Not applicable
    No triangle formed

23. Edge (5, 7): 5(4) - 7(5)
    Shared connections: Not applicable
