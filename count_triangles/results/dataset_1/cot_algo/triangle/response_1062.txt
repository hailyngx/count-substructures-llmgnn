Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0 has degree 3
Vertex 1 has degree 5
Vertex 2 has degree 3
Vertex 3 has degree 2
Vertex 4 has degree 3
Vertex 5 has degree 1
Vertex 6 has degree 4
Vertex 7 has degree 3
Vertex 8 has degree 4
Vertex 9 has degree 4

Sorted vertices based on their degrees:
5, 3, 0, 2, 7, 4, 8, 9, 6, 1 

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (0, 1) - Check for shared connections: (1, 2)
2. Edge (0, 2) - Check for shared connections: None
3. Edge (0, 9) - Check for shared connections: None
4. Edge (1, 2) - Check for shared connections: None
5. Edge (1, 3) - Check for shared connections: None
6. Edge (1, 7) - Check for shared connections: None
7. Edge (1, 8) - Check for shared connections: (1, 2, 8)
8. Edge (2, 8) - Check for shared connections: (1, 2, 8)
9. Edge (3, 9) - Check for shared connections: None
10. Edge (4, 5) - Check for shared connections: None
11. Edge (4, 6) - Check for shared connections: None
12. Edge (4, 8) - Check for shared connections: None
13. Edge (6, 7) - Check for shared connections: None
14. Edge (6, 9) - Check for shared connections: (1, 6, 9)
15. Edge (7, 6) - Check for shared connections: (1, 6, 7)
16. Edge (8, 4) - Check for shared connections: None

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: 
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
