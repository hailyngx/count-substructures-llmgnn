Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will re-label the nodes based on the number of connections each node has. The nodes and their corresponding degrees are as follows: 

(1) - 3 connections  
(3) - 3 connections  
(5) - 3 connections  
(6) - 2 connections  
(7) - 2 connections  
(4) - 5 connections  
(0) - 4 connections  
(2) - 5 connections  
(9) - 6 connections  
(8) - 7 connections  

Now, we will list the edges in ascending order based on the node labels:
(0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (8, 9)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by these edges:  
- Triangle <2, 3, 8>  
- Triangle <4, 6, 8>  
- Triangle <8, 9, 0>  
- Triangle <8, 9, 1>  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
