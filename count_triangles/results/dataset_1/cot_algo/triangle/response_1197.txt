Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

Nodes with their connections:
0: 2
1: 5
2: 3
3: 3
4: 3
5: 4
6: 3
7: 2
8: 4
9: 6

Sorted nodes:
0 < 7 < 1 < 4 < 2 < 3 < 6 < 5 < 8 < 9

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:

Triangles:
[22]
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 3>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<1, 8, 4>
<2, 5, 9>
