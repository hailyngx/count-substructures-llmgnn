Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

The vertices are labelled according to the number of connections they have:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 1 connection

Edges processed based on the rules:
(0, 1) - Node 0 < Node 1
Shared connections: 1, 4
(0, 4) - Node 0 < Node 4
Shared connections: 1
(0, 7) - Node 0 < Node 7
No triangle formed.
(0, 9) - Node 0 > Node 9
(1, 2) - Node 1 > Node 2
(1, 3) - Node 1 > Node 3
(1, 4) - Node 1 < Node 4
Shared connections: 0, 3
(1, 6) - Node 1 > Node 6
(1, 8) - Node 1 > Node 8
(2, 5) - Node 2 > Node 5
(2, 7) - Node 2 > Node 7
(3, 4) - Node 3 < Node 4
Shared connections: 1
(3, 6) - Node 3 > Node 6
(3, 7) - Node 3 < Node 7
Shared connections: 1
(4, 5) - Node 4 < Node 5
(5, 6) - Node 5 > Node 6
(6, 8) - Node 6 < Node 8
(7, 0) - Node 7 > Node 0
(7, 2) - Node 7 < Node 2
(7, 3) - Node 7 > Node 3
(8, 1) - Node 8 < Node 1
(8, 6) - Node 8 < Node 6
(9, 0) - Node 9 < Node 0

Total number of triangles: [1]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 4>
