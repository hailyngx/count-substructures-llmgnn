Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree, we have the following ordering:
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 0, 5, 4, 9, 6

The edges considered based on the ordering are:
(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (7, 4), (8, 5), (0, 9), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (5, 8), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the triangles formed:
1. <4, 5, 8>
2. <4, 6, 9>
3. <0, 9, 5>
4. <6, 2, 3>
5. <6, 1, 9>
6. <9, 0, 4>
7. <9, 5, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
