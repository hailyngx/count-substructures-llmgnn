Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Relabeling the nodes:
Node 0 -> 0
Node 1 -> 1
Node 5 -> 2
Node 7 -> 3
Node 6 -> 4
Node 3 -> 5
Node 9 -> 6
Node 2 -> 7
Node 4 -> 8
Node 8 -> 9

Checking the edges with the lower labeled node having fewer connections:
(0, 7) forms the triangle <0, 7, 3>.
(1, 3) forms the triangle <1, 3, 8>.
(1, 5) does not form a triangle.
(2, 4) does not form a triangle.
(2, 9) does not form a triangle.
(3, 1) does not need to be considered as (1, 3) is already processed.
(4, 2) does not form a triangle.
(5, 1) does not need to be considered as (1, 5) is already processed.
(6, 8) does not form a triangle.
(6, 9) does not form a triangle.
(7, 0) does not need to be considered as (0, 7) is already processed.
(8, 4) does not form a triangle.
(9, 2) does not need to be considered as (2, 9) is already processed.

Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <0, 7, 3>, <1, 3, 8>
