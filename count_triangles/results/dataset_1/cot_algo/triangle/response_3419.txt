Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:  

Vertices: 9, 0, 2, 8, 5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6  

Now, we can proceed to count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method.  

Total number of triangles: [6]  

Unique triangles found:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<1, 6, 7>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 7>
