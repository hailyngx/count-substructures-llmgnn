Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, 2, 1, 6, 5, 0, 4

Calculating the triangles:
1. Edge (2, 0) - Shared connections: 0, 3
2. Edge (1, 4) - Shared connections: 4, 5
3. Edge (2, 7) - Shared connections: 4
4. Edge (4, 5) - Shared connections: 0, 1, 5, 6
5. Edge (4, 7) - Shared connections: 5, 6
6. Edge (4, 8) - Shared connections: 9
7. Edge (4, 9) - Shared connections: 8

Total number of triangles: [7]
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 2>, <4, 5, 1>, <7, 4, 2>, <6, 5, 4>, <5, 6, 4>, <9, 8, 4>, <8, 9, 4>
