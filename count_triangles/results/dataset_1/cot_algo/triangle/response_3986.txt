Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Vertices sorted by degree:  \( 9 < 1 < 5 < 7 < 0 < 8 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 2 \) 

Triangles found: <2, 6, 7> <2, 6, 3> <2, 6, 1> <2, 6, 4> <3, 6, 7> <3, 6, 1> <5, 0, 9> <3, 1, 2>

Total number of triangles: [ 8 ]
