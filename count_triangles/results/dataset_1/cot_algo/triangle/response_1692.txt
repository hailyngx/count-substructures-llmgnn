Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Node 7 (Degree 1)
- Node 0 (Degree 2)
- Node 8 (Degree 2)
- Node 9 (Degree 2)
- Node 6 (Degree 3)
- Node 1 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 6)
- Node 4 (Not present in the given edges)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph:

1. For edge (0, 3) with labels 0 and 3, the shared connections are 2 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
2. For edge (0, 8) with labels 0 and 8, there are no shared connections.
3. For edge (1, 3) with labels 1 and 3, the shared connections are 2 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
4. For edge (1, 5) with labels 1 and 5, there are no shared connections.
5. For edge (1, 6) with labels 1 and 6, there are no shared connections.
6. For edge (2, 3) with labels 2 and 3, the shared connections are 0 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
7. For edge (2, 5) with labels 2 and 5, there are no shared connections.
8. For edge (2, 8) with labels 2 and 8, there are no shared connections.
9. For edge (3, 0) with labels 0 and 3, the shared connections are 2 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
10. For edge (3, 1) with labels 1 and 3, the shared connections are 2 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 2, 3>.
11. For edge (3, 2) with labels 2 and 3, the shared connections are 0 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <0, 2, 3>.
12. For edge (3, 5) with labels 3 and 5, the shared connections are 1 and 6. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 3, 6>.
13. For edge (3, 6) with labels 3 and 6, the shared connections are 1 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 3, 5>.
14. For edge (5, 1) with labels 1 and 5, there are no shared connections.
15. For edge (5, 2) with labels 2 and 5, there are no shared connections.
16. For edge (5, 3) with labels 3 and 5, the shared connections are 1 and 6. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 3, 6>.
17. For edge (5, 9) with labels 5 and 9, there are no shared connections.
18. For edge (6, 1) with labels 1 and 6, there are no shared connections.
19. For edge (6, 3) with labels 3 and 6, the shared connections are 1 and 5. Thus, we have the triangle <1, 3, 5>.
20. For edge (6, 9) with labels 6 and 9, there are no shared connections.
21. For edge(7, 9) with labels 7 and 9, there are no shared connections.
22. For edge (8, 0) with labels 0 and 8, there are no shared connections.
23. For edge (8, 2) with labels 2 and 8, there are no shared connections.
24. For edge (9, 5) with labels 5 and 9, there are no shared connections.
25. For edge (9, 6) with labels 6 and 9, there are no shared connections.
26. For edge (9, 7) with labels 7 and 9, there are no shared connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 4, and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 2, 3>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6> 

So, the final output is [4].
