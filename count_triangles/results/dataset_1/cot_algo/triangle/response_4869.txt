Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Sorting the vertices by their number of connections in increasing order gives us the following relabeling:  

Vertex 2 -- 1 connection  
Vertex 1, 6 -- 2 connections  
Vertex 0, 4, 5 -- 3 connections  
Vertex 3, 8 -- 4 connections  
Vertex 7, 9 -- 5 connections  

Following the degree-based ordering method and considering only edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

1. <0, 3, 7>  
2. <0, 3, 9>  
3. <0, 7, 8>  
4. <4, 1, 6>  
5. <3, 0, 7>  
6. <3, 0, 9>  
7. <3, 8, 6>  
8. <8, 6, 1>  
9. <8, 3, 9>  
10. <7, 0, 7>  
11. <7, 8, 9>  
12. <9, 4, 5>  
13. <9, 3, 7>  
  
Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [13].
