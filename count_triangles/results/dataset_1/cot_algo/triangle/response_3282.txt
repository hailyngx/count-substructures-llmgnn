Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 5 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 0 and 9 have 4 connections each.
Nodes 2 and 8 have 5 connections each.
Nodes 7 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Start with the edge (0, 1): Node 0 has 4 connections, which is more than Node 1's 1 connection, so we proceed.
2. Check for shared connections between Node 0 and Node 1: Both are connected to Node 7. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 1, 7>.

3. Moving on to the edge (0, 2): Node 0 has 4 connections which is more than Node 2's 5 connections, so we proceed.
4. Check for shared connections between Node 0 and Node 2: Both are connected to Nodes 6 and 7. Therefore, there are two triangles <0, 2, 6> and <0, 2, 7>.

5. For the edge (0, 6): Node 0 has 4 connections which is more than Node 6's 1 connection, so we proceed.
6. Check for shared connections between Node 0 and Node 6: Both are connected to Node 2. Therefore, there is a triangle <0, 2, 6>.

7. Skipping the edge (0, 7) as Node 0 has more connections than Node 7.

8. Moving on to the edge (1, 7): Node 1 has 1 connection which is less than Node 7's 6 connections, so we proceed.
9. Check for shared connections between Node 1 and Node 7: Both are connected to Node 0 and Node 2. Therefore, there are two triangles <1, 0, 2> and <1, 2, 7>.

10. Continuing this process for all remaining edges, we find additional triangles: <1, 7, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, and <2, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
