Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to calculate the degree of each node:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 2

Sorting in ascending order of degree:
Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 0, Node 0, Node 4, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 6, Node 0

Now, we will count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 9): No triangles
- Edge (3, 0): No triangles
- Edge (5, 4): No triangles
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles
- Edge (9, 1): No triangles

So, the total number of triangles is [2].

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 4, 6>
