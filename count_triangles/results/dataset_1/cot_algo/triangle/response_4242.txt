Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 6: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 9: 5 connections

We will now relabel the nodes in ascending order of their degrees:
- Node 6 (1 connection)
- Node 7 (1 connection)
- Node 8 (1 connection)
- Node 1 (2 connections)
- Node 2 (2 connections)
- Node 5 (2 connections)
- Node 0 (3 connections)
- Node 3 (4 connections)
- Node 9 (5 connections)
  
Next, we will analyze the edges starting from the edges involving nodes with the lowest labels:

Edges involving Node 6 or 6:
- No edges

Edges involving Node 7 or 7:
- No edges

Edges involving Node 8 or 8:
- No edges

Edges involving Node 1 or 1:
- Edge (1, 3) - Check connections with Node 3: Triangle <1, 3, 2>

Edges involving Node 2 or 2:
- No valid edges

Edges involving Node 5 or 5:
- Edge (5, 0) - Check connections with Node 0: Triangle <5, 0, 7>
- No valid edges

Edges involving Node 0 or 0:
- Edge (0, 5) - Check connections with Node 5: Triangle <0, 5, 3>
- No valid edges
- Edge (0, 7) - Check connections with Node 7: No triangle
- Edge (0, 9) - Check connections with Node 9: Triangle <0, 9, 1>

Edges involving Node 3 or 3:
- Edge (3, 1) - Check connections with Node 1: Triangle <3, 1, 9>
- Edge (3, 2) - Check connections with Node 2: Triangle <3, 2, 9>
- Edge (3, 5) - Check connections with Node 5: Triangle <3, 5, 0>
- Edge (3, 9) - Check connections with Node 9: Triangle <3, 9, 1>

Edges involving Node 9 or 9:
- No valid edges

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
