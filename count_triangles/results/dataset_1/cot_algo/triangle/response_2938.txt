Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0: degree 2
- Vertex 1: degree 1
- Vertex 2: degree 2
- Vertex 3: degree 2
- Vertex 4: degree 1
- Vertex 5: degree 1
- Vertex 6: degree 2
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 4
- Vertex 9: degree 4

Now, we relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes vertex 0
- Vertex 1 (degree 1) becomes vertex 1
- Vertex 2 (degree 2) becomes vertex 2
- Vertex 3 (degree 2) becomes vertex 3
- Vertex 4 (degree 1) becomes vertex 4
- Vertex 5 (degree 1) becomes vertex 5
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes vertex 6
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) becomes vertex 7
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) becomes vertex 8
- Vertex 9 (degree 4) becomes vertex 9

Now, we go through each edge in the graph, considering only the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 0 and 8. Triangle found: <0, 8, 4>
- Edge (0, 9): No triangle formed.

- Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.

- Edge (2, 3): Check for shared connections between vertices 2 and 3. Triangle found: <2, 3, 9>
- Edge (2, 5): No triangle formed.

- Edge (4, 8): No triangle formed.

- Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.

- Edge (7, 8): Check for shared connections between vertices 7 and 8. Triangle found: <7, 8, 0>
- Edge (7, 9): Check for shared connections between vertices 7 and 9. Triangle found: <7, 9, 0>

Total number of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <0, 8, 4>, <2, 3, 9>, <7, 8, 0>
