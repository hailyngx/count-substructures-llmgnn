Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 0: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the number of triangles formed:

1. Edge (0, 2): Since both nodes 0 and 2 have 4 connections, we proceed. Nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a triangle. 
2. Edge (0, 4): Since node 0 has 5 connections, we proceed. Nodes 0, 4, and 2 form a triangle.
3. Edge (0, 8): Since node 0 has 5 connections, we proceed. Nodes 0, 8, and 3 form a triangle.
4. Edge (0, 9): Since node 0 has 5 connections, we proceed. Nodes 0, 9, and 1 form a triangle.
5. Edge (1, 6): Since both nodes 1 and 6 have 2 connections, we proceed. No triangle is formed.
6. Edge (1, 7): Since node 1 has 3 connections, we proceed. Nodes 1, 7, and 4 form a triangle.
7. Edge (1, 9): Since node 1 has 3 connections, we proceed. No triangle is formed.
8. Edge (2, 4): Already counted in edge (0, 2).
9. Edge (2, 6): Since both nodes 2 and 6 have 2 connections, we proceed. No triangle is formed.
10. Edge (3, 4): Since node 3 has 1 connection, we proceed. No triangle is formed.
11. Edge (3, 8): Since node 3 has 1 connection, we proceed. No triangle is formed.
12. Edge (4, 7): Already counted in edge (1, 7).
13. Edge (4, 8): Already counted in edge (0, 8).
14. Edge (4, 5): Since node 4 has 6 connections, we proceed. Nodes 4, 5, and 7 form a triangle. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [3].

The unique triangles found are: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 8, 3>
<1, 7, 4>
