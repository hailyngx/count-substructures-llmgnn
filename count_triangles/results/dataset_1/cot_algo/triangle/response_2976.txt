Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by connections:
0 (2 connections)
3 (2 connections)
4 (1 connection)
5 (2 connections)
7 (3 connections)
6 (4 connections)
9 (6 connections)
1 (7 connections)
8 (7 connections)
2 (8 connections)

Now, we will count the triangles using the sorted vertices and the provided edges:

Triangles (in the format of <vertex1, vertex2, vertex3>):
<0, 2, 1>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 3>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 5>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 9, 4>
<1, 9, 5>
<1, 9, 7>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 8, 3>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 7>

Total number of triangles: [16]
