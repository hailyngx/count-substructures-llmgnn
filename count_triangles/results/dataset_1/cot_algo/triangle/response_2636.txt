Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Vertex 0 has 2 connections.
Vertex 4 has 1 connection.
Vertex 8 has 2 connections.
Vertex 1 has 2 connections.
Vertex 9 has 2 connections.
Vertex 6 has 3 connections.
Vertex 7 has 3 connections.
Vertex 5 has 4 connections.
Vertex 2 has 4 connections.
Vertex 3 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we examine each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

- Edge (0, 3): Both vertices have 2 shared connections: 8 and 5. This forms a triangle <0, 3, 5>.
- Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 (2 connections) has fewer connections than vertex 8 (2 connections), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 (2 connections) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (4 connections), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (2, 3): Both vertices have 4 shared connections: 5, 6, 7, and 9. This forms a triangle <2, 3, 5>.
- Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 (4 connections) has fewer connections than vertex 5 (4 connections), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (2, 6): Vertex 2 (4 connections) has fewer connections than vertex 6 (3 connections), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 (6 connections) has more connections than vertex 4 (1 connection), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (3, 7): Both vertices have 4 shared connections: 5, 9, 2, and 6. This forms a triangle <3, 7, 5>.
- Edge (5, 7): Both vertices have 3 shared connections: 1, 9, and 3. This forms a triangle <5, 7, 3>.
- Edge (6, 8): Vertex 6 (3 connections) has fewer connections than vertex 8 (2 connections), so we ignore this edge.
- Edge (6, 9): Both vertices have 2 shared connections: 1 and 7. This forms a triangle <6, 9, 1>.
- Edge (7, 9): Both vertices have 3 shared connections: 1, 5, and 3. This forms a triangle <7, 9, 1>.

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are <0, 3, 5>, <3, 7, 5>, and <6, 9, 1>.
