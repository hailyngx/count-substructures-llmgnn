Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first list the vertices with their degree:

0: 1 (neighbors: 1)
2: 1 (neighbors: 8)
5: 1 (neighbors: 6)
8: 1 (neighbors: 2)
4: 2 (neighbors: 1, 6)
7: 2 (neighbors: 3, 9)
5: 2 (neighbors: 6, 6)
3: 3 (neighbors: 1, 7, 1)
6: 4 (neighbors: 4, 5, 9, 6)
1: 4 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 1)

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

0: 0
2: 1
5: 2
8: 3
4: 4
7: 5
5: 6
3: 7
6: 8
1: 9

Next, we will check for triangles using the given edges:

(0, 1): No triangle
(1, 3): Triangle <1, 3, 7>
(1, 4): No triangle
(2, 8): No triangle
(3, 7): No triangle
(4, 6): No triangle
(5, 6): No triangle
(6, 9): No triangle
(7, 9): Triangle <7, 9, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
