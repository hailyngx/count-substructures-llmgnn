Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's count the degree of each vertex:
- Vertex 0 has degree 2
- Vertex 1 has degree 2
- Vertex 2 has degree 5
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 4 has degree 4
- Vertex 6 has degree 3
- Vertex 7 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 3
- Vertex 9 has degree 1

Now, let's relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 0 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 7 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 8 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 2 (degree 5) becomes Vertex 8

Now, let's go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 2): No triangles
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles
- Edge (1, 3): 1 triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles
- Edge (2, 0): No triangles
- Edge (2, 3): 1 triangle <8, 1, 6>
- Edge (2, 4): 1 triangle <8, 2, 7>
- Edge (2, 6): 2 triangles <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 6>
- Edge (3, 1): 1 triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Edge (3, 2): 2 triangles <8, 1, 6>, <8, 2, 7>
- Edge (3, 4): 1 triangle <7, 2, 6>
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles
- Edge (4, 2): 1 triangle <7, 2, 6>
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles
- Edge (6, 0): No triangles
- Edge (6, 2): 2 triangles <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 6>
- Edge (7, 8): No triangles
- Edge (8, 7): No triangles
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [9]
Unique triangles: <1, 2, 6>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 2, 7>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <7, 2, 6>, <1, 4, 6>, <4, 7, 6>
