Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: 4 connections
- Node 1: 2 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 4: 3 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 7: 3 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 4 connections

Based on the degrees, we relabel the nodes in increasing order of connections:
- Node 3 (1 connection)
- Node 5 (1 connection)
- Node 1 (2 connections)
- Node 2 (2 connections)
- Node 8 (2 connections)
- Node 4 (3 connections)
- Node 7 (3 connections)
- Node 0 (4 connections)
- Node 6 (4 connections)
- Node 9 (4 connections)

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. (0, 1) does not form any triangle.
2. (0, 2) does not form any triangle.
3. (0, 3) does not form any triangle.
4. (0, 4) forms a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
5. (1, 6) forms a triangle <1, 6, 7>.
6. (2, 9) does not form any triangle.
7. (3, 0) does not form any triangle.
8. (4, 0) does not form any triangle.
9. (4, 8) does not form any triangle.
10. (4, 9) does not form any triangle.
11. (5, 6) does not form any triangle.
12. (6, 1) does not form any triangle.
13. (6, 5) does not form any triangle.
14. (6, 7) does not form any triangle.
15. (6, 9) forms a triangle <6, 9, 7>.
16. (7, 6) does not form any triangle.
17. (7, 8) does not form any triangle.
18. (7, 9) does not form any triangle.
19. (8, 4) does not form any triangle.
20. (8, 7) does not form any triangle.
21. (9, 2) does not form any triangle.
22. (9, 4) does not form any triangle.
23. (9, 6) does not form any triangle.
24. (9, 7) does not form any triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
