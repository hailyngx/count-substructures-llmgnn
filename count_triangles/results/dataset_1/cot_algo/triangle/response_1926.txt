Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, the new labeling is:

0 (degree 1)  
4 (degree 1)  
7 (degree 1)  
5 (degree 2)  
1 (degree 3)  
2 (degree 3)  
9 (degree 3)  
6 (degree 4)  
3 (degree 5)  
8 (degree 6)

Using the degree-based ordering method, we can now count the number of triangles in the graph.

There are [15] triangles in the graph.
The unique triangles found are: <3, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 6, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 6>, <0, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 8, 9>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 8, 9>.
