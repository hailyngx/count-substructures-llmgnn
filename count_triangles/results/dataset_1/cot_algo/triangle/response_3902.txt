Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps us count the number of triangles in the graph given the number of nodes and edges. First, we need to sort the nodes by their degree (number of connections). After relabeling the vertices according to the sorted order, we analyze each edge starting from the node with the lower label and count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The sorted order of nodes based on their degree is: 1, 9, 3, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7, 2

Analyzing the edges while considering only the node with the lower label having fewer connections:

1. Node 1 (Degree 2):
   - Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with node 2 and shared connection 7. Triangle: <1, 2, 7>

2. Node 9 (Degree 2):
   - Edge (9, 2): Forms a triangle with node 2 and shared connection 8. Triangle: <9, 2, 8>

3. Node 3 (Degree 3):
   - Edge (3, 5): Forms a triangle with node 5 and shared connection 7. Triangle: <3, 5, 7>
   - Edge (3, 6): Forms a triangle with node 6 and shared connection 2. Triangle: <3, 6, 2>
   - Edge (3, 9): Forms a triangle with node 9 and shared connection 2. Triangle: <3, 9, 2>

4. Node 4 (Degree 3):
   - Edge (4, 6): Forms a triangle with node 6 and shared connection 2. Triangle: <4, 6, 2>
   - Edge (4, 7): Forms a triangle with node 7 and shared connection 1. Triangle: <4, 7, 1>
   - Edge (4, 8): Forms a triangle with node 8 and shared connection 5. Triangle: <4, 8, 5>

5. Node 8 (Degree 3):
   - Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle with node 2 and shared connection 6. Triangle: <8, 2, 6>
   - Edge (8, 4): Forms a triangle with node 4 and shared connection 5. Triangle: <8, 4, 5>
   - Edge (8, 5): Forms a triangle with node 5 and shared connection 3. Triangle: <8, 5, 3>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
