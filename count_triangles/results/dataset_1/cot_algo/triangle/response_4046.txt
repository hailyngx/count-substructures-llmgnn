Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we have the following relabeling: 

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 6
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 6
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 6

Proceeding with the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider edges where the lower labeled vertex has the fewer connections. 

Checking for triangles: 
- For edge (0, 9) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 0, we find a triangle <0, 4, 9>.
- For edge (1, 2) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 1, we find no triangles.
- For edge (1, 3) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 1, we find no triangles.
- For edge (1, 4) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 1, we find a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
- For edge (1, 6) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 1, we find no triangles.
- For edge (1, 9) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 1, we find a triangle <1, 4, 9>.
- For edge (2, 3) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 2, we find no triangles.
- For edge (4, 7) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 4, we find no triangles.
- For edge (4, 8) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 4, we find no triangles.
- For edge (5, 7) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 5, we find no triangles.
- For edge (6, 1) with the lower labeled vertex being Node 6, we find no triangles.

Counting the unique triangles found:
- <0, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
