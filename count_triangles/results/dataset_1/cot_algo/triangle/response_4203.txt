Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labeling is as follows:
Node 1 (degree 2) -> Node 4 (degree 3) -> Node 8 (degree 1) -> Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 3 (degree 3) -> Node 7 (degree 3) -> Node 5 (degree 4) -> Node 9 (degree 4) -> Node 6 (degree 4)

By applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order: (6, 9), (4, 7), (4, 7), (7, 6), (7, 6), (4, 3), (5, 4), (4, 3), (6, 7), (9, 3), (6, 9), (9, 5).

Thus, the number of triangles in the graph is [6].

The unique triangles found are: <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <5, 4, 7>, <6, 7, 9>.
