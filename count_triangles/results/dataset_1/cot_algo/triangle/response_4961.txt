Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices based on their degree. The degrees of the vertices are as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 2
Vertex 1: degree 2
Vertex 2: degree 1
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 6: degree 1
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 9: degree 4

After sorting, the new labels for the vertices are:
Vertex 2: 0
Vertex 6: 1
Vertex 0: 2
Vertex 1: 3
Vertex 3: 4
Vertex 7: 5
Vertex 9: 6

Now, we will check the edges one by one:
(0, 3): Shared connections: 9 -> Triangle <0, 3, 9>
(0, 9): No triangle
(1, 2): No triangle
(1, 9): No triangle
(2, 1): No triangle
(3, 0): Shared connections: 9 -> Triangle <0, 3, 9>
(3, 7): Shared connections: 9 -> Triangle <3, 7, 9>
(3, 9): No triangle
(6, 7): No triangle
(7, 3): Shared connections: 9 -> Triangle <3, 7, 9>
(7, 6): No triangle
(7, 9): No triangle
(9, 0): Shared connections: 3 -> Triangle <0, 3, 9>
(9, 1): No triangle
(9, 3): No triangle
(9, 7): No triangle

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 9>, and <0, 3, 9>.
