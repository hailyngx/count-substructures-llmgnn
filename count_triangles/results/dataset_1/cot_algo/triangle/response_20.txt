Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their number of connections:

Vertices:
0 -> 5 connections (node 8)
1 -> 4 connections (node 4)
2 -> 4 connections (node 6)
3 -> 4 connections (node 9)
4 -> 4 connections (node 1)
5 -> 3 connections (node 3)
6 -> 3 connections (node 7)
7 -> 2 connections (node 2)
8 -> 2 connections (node 5)
9 -> 1 connection (node 0)

Now, we will only consider edges where the node with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (1, 2) is skipped, as both nodes have the same number of connections.
- Edge (1, 6) forms a triangle with node 4 (1, 4, 6).
- Edge (3, 4) is skipped, as both nodes have the same number of connections.
- Edge (5, 8) forms a triangle with node 3 (3, 5, 8).
- Edge (6, 1) forms a triangle with node 9 (1, 6, 9).
- Edge (7, 6) is skipped, as both nodes have the same number of connections.
- Edge (8, 4) is skipped, as node 4 has more connections than node 8.

Count of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles:
<1, 4, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<1, 6, 9>
