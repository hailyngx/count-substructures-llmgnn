Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each node:
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Next, let's relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 2: 1
Node 4: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 7: 5
Node 9: 6
Node 1: 7
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 9

Now let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <1, 4, 9> (Nodes 2, 3, 6)
- Triangle <1, 5, 6> (Nodes 2, 4, 7)
- Triangle <1, 5, 8> (Nodes 2, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3].
