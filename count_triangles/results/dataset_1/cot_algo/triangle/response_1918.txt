Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:
Node 2: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 4, 8: 3 connections
Nodes 5, 6, 9: 4 connections
Node 7: 5 connections

Now, we'll relabel the nodes accordingly:
Node 2: 0
Node 1: 1
Nodes 0, 4, 8: 2
Nodes 5, 6, 9: 3
Node 7: 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we look at each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 4): Both nodes have 3 connections. No triangle formed.
2. Edge (0, 6): Node 2 has 3 connections, Node 3 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
3. Edge (0, 7): Node 2 has 3 connections, Node 4 has 5 connections. No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 5): Both nodes have 4 connections. No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 9): Node 1 has 2 connections, Node 3 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
6. Edge (2, 8): Node 0 has 1 connection, Node 3 has 4 connections. No triangle formed.
7. Edge (4, 0): Same as Edge 1.
... (we continue checking all edges)

Following the process for all edges, we find the total number of triangles is 19.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
