Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the graph. 

After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices will be:
Nodes: 5, 7, 4, 6, 0, 3, 1, 8, 2, 9

The new representation of the edges based on the labels is as follows:
(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8)

By following the method of counting triangles with shared connections between the two vertices of each edge, we find the following unique triangles:
<0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
