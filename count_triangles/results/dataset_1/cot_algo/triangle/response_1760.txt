Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new vertex labels and connections are as follows:
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections: [3, 8]
- Vertex 2 has 2 connections: [4, 8]
- Vertex 7 has 2 connections: [1, 6]
- Vertex 9 has 3 connections: [3, 5, 8]
- Vertex 6 has 3 connections: [1, 7, 8]
- Vertex 1 has 4 connections: [4, 5, 6, 7]
- Vertex 5 has 4 connections: [1, 4, 8, 9]
- Vertex 3 has 4 connections: [0, 4, 9]
- Vertex 8 has 6 connections: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
- Vertex 4 has 6 connections: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph. 

After analyzing each edge, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].

The unique triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 8, 5>
<5, 8, 9>
