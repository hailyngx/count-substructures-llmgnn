Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the order is as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Nodes 0, 6, 7, 9: 4 connections
Nodes 3, 5, 8: 5 connections
Node 4: 6 connections
Node 2: 7 connections

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 share a connection with Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 8): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
3. Edge (1, 6): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
4. Edge (1, 7): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
5. Edge (2, 0): Already counted.
6. Edge (2, 3): Nodes 2 and 3 share a connection with Node 7, forming a triangle <2, 3, 7>.
7. Edge (2, 6): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
8. Edge (2, 7): Already counted.
9. Edge (3, 2): Already counted.
10. Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 share a connection, forming a triangle <3, 4, 5>.
11. Edge (3, 5): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
12. Edge (3, 7): Already counted.
13. Edge (4, 3): Already counted.
14. Edge (4, 5): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
15. Edge (4, 8): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
16. Edge (4, 9): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
17. Edge (5, 3): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
18. Edge (5, 4): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
19. Edge (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 share a connection with Node 1, forming a triangle <1, 5, 6>.
20. Edge (5, 9): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
21. Edge (6, 1): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
22. Edge (6, 2): Already counted.
23. Edge (6, 5): Already counted.
24. Edge (6, 7): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
25. Edge (7, 1): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
26. Edge (7, 2): Already counted.
27. Edge (7, 3): Already counted.
28. Edge (7, 6): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
29. Edge (8, 0): Already counted.
30. Edge (8, 4): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
31. Edge (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <4, 8, 9>.
32. Edge (9, 4): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
33. Edge (9, 5): Not processed due to Degree-Based Ordering.
34. Edge (9, 8): Already counted.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3] and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, and <1, 5, 6>.
