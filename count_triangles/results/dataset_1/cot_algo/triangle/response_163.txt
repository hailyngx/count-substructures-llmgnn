Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Node 4: 0 connections
Node 6: 0 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 9: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices accordingly:

Node 4 (0 connections) -> Node 0
Node 6 (0 connections) -> Node 1
Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node 2
Node 9 (1 connection) -> Node 3
Node 2 (2 connections) -> Node 4
Node 5 (3 connections) -> Node 5
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 6
Node 3 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 7 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 0 (4 connections) -> Node 9

Now, we will list the edges based on the relabeling order:

(0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8)

Now, we will count the number of triangles formed:

Total number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles: <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <7, 6, 8>
