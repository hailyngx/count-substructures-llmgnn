Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 3 (Degree 2) -> Node 2 (Degree 1) -> Node 8 (Degree 2) -> Node 5 (Degree 2) -> Node 7 (Degree 2) -> Node 1 (Degree 3) -> Node 9 (Degree 3) -> Node 6 (Degree 3) -> Node 4 (Degree 4) -> Node 0 (Degree 5)

Now, we will count the triangles formed by following the edges based on the degree ordering:

Triangles:
1. <0, 1, 3>
2. <0, 1, 8>
3. <0, 2, 3>
4. <0, 5, 7>
5. <0, 6, 4>
6. <0, 6, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 6]
