Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method helps to efficiently count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order:

Nodes: 7, 0, 1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 2, 8, 4

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on the above order:

New labels: 
7->0, 0->1, 1->2, 5->3, 3->4, 9->5, 6->6, 2->7, 8->8, 4->9

Now, we will analyze each edge considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Examining the edges, we find the following triangles:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<2, 4, 6>
<2, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>

Finally, the total number of triangles found in the graph is [8].
