Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we get the following relabeling: 

Nodes: 9, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's go through each edge and identify the triangles:

- Edge (0, 2):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 8 and 2.
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
  - Nodes 0 and 2 share a connection with node 8. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 8>.

- Edge (0, 8):
  - Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 8.
  - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
  - Nodes 0 and 8 share a connection. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (2, 0):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (2, 4):
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
  - Node 4 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 8.
  - Nodes 2 and 4 share a connection. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (2, 9):
  - Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
  - Node 9 has connection with node 2.
  - Nodes 2 and 9 share a connection. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (3, 4):
  - Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 7, and 8.
  - Node 4 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 8.
  - Nodes 3 and 4 share a connection with each other. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (3, 7):
  - Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 7, and 8.
  - Node 7 has connections with nodes 3, 6, and 8.
  - Nodes 3 and 7 share a connection with each other. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (3, 8):
  - Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 7, and 8.
  - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
  - Nodes 3 and 8 share a connection with each other. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (4, 2):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (4, 3):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (4, 8):
  - Node 4 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 8.
  - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
  - Nodes 4 and 8 share a connection with each other. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (5, 8):
  - Node 5 has connection with node 8.
  - Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
  - Nodes 5 and 8 share a connection. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (6, 7):
  - Node 6 has connection with node 7.
  - Node 7 has connections with nodes 3, 6, and 8.
  - Nodes 6 and 7 share a connection. No new triangles found with this edge.

- Edge (7, 3):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (7, 6):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (7, 8):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (8, 0):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (8, 3):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (8, 4):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (8, 5):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (8, 7):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

- Edge (9, 2):
  - This edge has already been covered with the above analysis.

After analyzing all edges, we found 1 unique triangle: <0, 2, 8>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [1].
