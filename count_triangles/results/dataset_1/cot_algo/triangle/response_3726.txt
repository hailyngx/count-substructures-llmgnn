Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then checking for triangles.
The sorted vertices are: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, 4, 8, 0, 5, 1, 5, 0, 4, 0, 5, 2, 6, 8, 2, 8, 6, 2.
Let's count the number of triangles by following the method:

Analyzing vertices with label 7:
- No triangles involving vertex 7 as the connections are not in the format required for triangles.

Analyzing vertices with label 9:
- No triangles involving vertex 9 as the connections are not in the format required for triangles.

Analyzing vertices with label 3:
- No triangles involving vertex 3 as the connections are not in the format required for triangles.

Analyzing vertices with label 1:
- Triangle <0, 1, 2> is formed.

Analyzing vertices with label 9:
- No more vertices left to check.

Count of triangles: [1]
Triangles found: <0, 1, 2>
