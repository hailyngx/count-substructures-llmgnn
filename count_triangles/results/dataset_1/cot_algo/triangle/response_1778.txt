Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
Node 0 -> Label 0 (Degree 2)
Node 1 -> Label 1 (Degree 3)
Node 2 -> Label 2 (Degree 2)
Node 6 -> Label 3 (Degree 4)
Node 4 -> Label 4 (Degree 4)
Node 8 -> Label 5 (Degree 2)
Node 5 -> Label 6 (Degree 4)
Node 7 -> Label 7 (Degree 4)
Node 3 -> Label 8 (Degree 5)
Node 9 -> Label 9 (Degree 5)

Now, let's check for triangles based on degree-based ordering:

1. Edge (0, 5): Node 0 (Label 0) has fewer connections than Node 5 (Label 6).
   Node 0 (Label 0) shares connections with Node 5 (Label 6) at Node 9 (Label 9). Triangle: <0, 5, 9>

2. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 (Label 0) shares connections with Node 9 (Label 9) at Node 5 (Label 6). Triangle: <0, 9, 5>

3. Edge (1, 4): Node 1 (Label 1) has fewer connections than Node 4 (Label 4).
   Node 1 (Label 1) shares connections with Node 4 (Label 4) at Node 9 (Label 9). Triangle: <1, 4, 9>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
