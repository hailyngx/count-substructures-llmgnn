Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by degree are: 1, 7, 5, 7, 4, 3, 6, 4, 9, 6.  
After relabeling, the vertices become: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 

The unique triangles found in the graph are: 
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 5>
<8, 9, 5>
<8, 9, 2>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
