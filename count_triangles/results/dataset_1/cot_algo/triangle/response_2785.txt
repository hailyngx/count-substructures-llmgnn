Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Nodes sorted by their number of connections in increasing order:
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 5

Now, we will check the edges according to the sorting:

Checking edge (0, 4):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other, so we proceed.
They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <0, 4, 9>.

Checking edge (0, 7):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other, so we proceed.
They share a connection with nodes 2 and 9, forming triangles <0, 7, 2> and <0, 7, 9>.

Checking edge (1, 3):
Node 1 has fewer connections than node 3, so we proceed.
They share connections with node 9, forming a triangle <1, 3, 9>.

Checking edge (1, 8):
Both nodes have fewer connections than each other, so we proceed.
They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <1, 8, 9>.

Checking edge (1, 9):
Node 1 has fewer connections than node 9, so we proceed.
They share a connection with node 3, forming a triangle <1, 9, 3>.

Checking edge (2, 3):
Node 2 has fewer connections than node 3, so we proceed.
They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>.

Node 4 has fewer connections than node 0, so we proceed.
They share a connection with node 9, forming a triangle <4, 0, 9>.

Checking edge (4, 9):
Node 4 has fewer connections than node 9, so we proceed.
They share connections with nodes 0, 3, and 7, forming triangles <4, 9, 0>, <4, 9, 3>, and <4, 9, 7>.
