Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices by their number of connections from least to most:
Vertices: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0

Now, we relabel the vertices with their new order based on degree:
(4) - 0 connections
(5) - 0 connections
(7) - 0 connections
(8) - 0 connections
(9) - 1 connection
(6) - 2 connections
(3) - 3 connections
(1) - 3 connections
(2) - 4 connections
(0) - 5 connections

Now, we will check for shared connections between vertices with lower labels:
For each edge, we will only proceed if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. 

Examining the edges:
(4, 3) does not form a triangle.
(5, 3) does not form a triangle.
(7, 2) does not form a triangle.
(8, 2) does not form a triangle.
(9, 1) does not form a triangle.
(6, 0) does not form a triangle.
(3, 0) does not form a triangle.
(3, 1) forms a triangle: <1, 2, 3>
(2, 1) does not form a triangle.
(2, 6) forms a triangle: <0, 2, 6>
(2, 7) does not form a triangle.
(2, 8) does not form a triangle.
(1, 0) forms a triangle: <0, 1, 3>
(1, 9) does not form a triangle.
(0, 6) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
