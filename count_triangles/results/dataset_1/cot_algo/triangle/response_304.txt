Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on their degrees, the sorted list of vertices is: 
Node 6         (0 connections)  
Node 9         (1 connection)  
Node 4         (1 connection)  
Node 1         (3 connections)  
Node 5         (3 connections)  
Node 2         (4 connections)  
Node 8         (4 connections)  
Node 7         (5 connections)  
Node 3         (6 connections)  

Next, we count the triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:

<1, 2, 7>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
