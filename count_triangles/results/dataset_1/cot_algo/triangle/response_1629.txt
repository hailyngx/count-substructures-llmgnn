Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:
Vertices with their degrees in parentheses: 
(6) (5) (2) (2) (4) (5) (6) (5) (5) (4)

Relabeled vertices: 
0 ⟶ 6
1 ⟶ 5
2 ⟶ 2
3 ⟶ 2
4 ⟶ 4
5 ⟶ 5
6 ⟶ 6
7 ⟶ 5
8 ⟶ 5
9 ⟶ 4

After relabeling the vertices, we can now list the edges based on the new labels and count the number of triangles:
(6, 5) forms a triangle with (6, 1) and (1, 5)
(5, 6) forms a triangle with (5, 1) and (6, 1)
(5, 5) forms a triangle with (5, 1) and (5, 8)
(5, 5) forms a triangle with (5, 8) and (8, 5)
(5, 8) forms a triangle with (5, 1) and (8, 1)
Total number of triangles: [5]

Unique triangles:
<6, 1, 5>
<5, 8, 1>
<8, 5, 1>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 1, 8>
