Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering method helps in counting the number of triangles efficiently.

1. List the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1, 8

2. Count and update the degree of each vertex:
0: 1
2: 1
4: 1
6: 1
5: 1
3: 1
7: 3
9: 3
1: 4
8: 4

3. Sorted list based on the updated degrees:
Vertices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1, 8

4. Specify the edges based on the sorted vertices:
Edges: (0, 1) (1, 0) (5, 1) (7, 1) (1, 7) (9, 6) (8, 2) (3, 7) (8, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) (2, 8) (9, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7)

5. Count the triangles:
Total number of triangles: [2]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
