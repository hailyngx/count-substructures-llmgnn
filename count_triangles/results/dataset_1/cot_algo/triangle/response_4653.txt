Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degree, we get the following labels: 

Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 1 connection.
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 3 connections.
Node 8 has 4 connections.
Node 4 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will count the triangles:

1. Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with node 6: <0, 1, 6>.
2. Edge (0, 6) does not form any triangles.
3. Edge (1, 0) does not form any triangles.
4. Edge (1, 3) does not form any triangles.
5. Edge (1, 4) forms triangles with nodes 2 and 9: <1, 2, 4> and <1, 4, 9>.
6. Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with node 3: <1, 3, 9>.
7. Edge (2, 3) does not form any triangles.
8. Edge (2, 4) does not form any triangles.
9. Edge (3, 1) does not form any triangles.
10. Edge (3, 2) does not form any triangles.
11. Edge (3, 9) does not form any triangles.
12. Edge (4, 1) does not form any triangles.
13. Edge (4, 2) does not form any triangles.
14. Edge (4, 6) does not form any triangles.
15. Edge (5, 8) does not form any triangles.
16. Edge (6, 0) does not form any triangles.
17. Edge (6, 4) forms a triangle with node 9: <4, 6, 9>.
18. Edge (6, 9) does not form any triangles.
19. Edge (7, 8) does not form any triangles.
20. Edge (8, 5) does not form any triangles.
21. Edge (8, 7) does not form any triangles.
22. Edge (8, 9) does not form any triangles.
23. Edge (9, 1) does not form any triangles.
24. Edge (9, 3) does not form any triangles.
25. Edge (9, 6) does not form any triangles.
26. Edge (9, 8) does not form any triangles.

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 6>, <1, 2, 4>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>.
