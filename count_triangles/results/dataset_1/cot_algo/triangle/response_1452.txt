Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the nodes by their degrees:

Node 7: 1 connection
Node 8: 1 connection
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Since it's important to proceed only if the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we will start by examining the edges that meet this criterion.

Examining the edges where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections:
1. Edge (0, 4): Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <0, 4, 1>
2. Edge (0, 5): Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle: <0, 5, 2>
3. Edge (0, 6): Forms a triangle with node 1. Triangle: <0, 6, 1>
4. Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (1, 2): Forms a triangle with node 3. Triangle: <1, 2, 3>
6. Edge (1, 3): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (1, 4): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <1, 4, 0>
8. Edge (1, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <1, 6, 0>
9. Edge (2, 3): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (2, 5): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <2, 5, 0>
11. Edge (2, 6): Forms a triangle with node 0. Triangle: <2, 6, 0>
12. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
14. Edge (4, 7): No triangle formed.
15. Edge (8, 2): No triangle formed.
16. Edge (9, 4): Forms a triangle with node 2. Triangle: <9, 4, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 8, and the unique triangles found are:
<0, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 2>
<0, 6, 1>
<1, 2, 3>
<1, 4, 0>
<1, 6, 0>
<2, 5, 0>
<2, 6, 0>

So, the final output is:
[8]
