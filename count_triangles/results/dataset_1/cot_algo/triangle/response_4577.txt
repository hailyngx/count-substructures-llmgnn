Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are: 

Node 1: 4 connections  
Node 0: 4 connections  
Node 7: 4 connections  
Node 9: 4 connections  
Node 5: 1 connection  
Node 6: 3 connections  
Node 3: 4 connections  
Node 2: 4 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles formed by the edges. 

There is 1 triangle <0, 4, 8>.  
There is 1 triangle <0, 6, 8>.  
There is 1 triangle <0, 5, 8>.  
There is 1 triangle <0, 8, 7>.  
There is 1 triangle <0, 8, 2>.  
There is 1 triangle <4, 8, 9>.  
There is 1 triangle <7, 8, 9>.  
There is 1 triangle <1, 3, 2>.  
There is 1 triangle <1, 3, 7>.  

Therefore, there are a total of [9] triangles in the given graph.
