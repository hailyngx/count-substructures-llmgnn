Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labelling for the nodes is as follows:
Nodes: 3, 4, 6, 9, 1, 5, 7, 0, 8, 2

Now, we will count the number of triangles by examining each edge:
- Edge (0, 1): Shared connections = {5} -> Triangle(s): <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (0, 2): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (0, 5): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (1, 0): Shared connections = {5} -> Triangle(s): <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 5): Shared connections = {0} -> Triangle(s): <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 8): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (2, 0): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (2, 7): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (2, 9): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (3, 4): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (3, 6): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (3, 8): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (4, 3): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (4, 9): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (5, 0): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (5, 1): Shared connections = {0} -> Triangle(s): <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (6, 3): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (6, 7): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (6, 8): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (7, 2): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (7, 6): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (7, 9): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (8, 1): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (8, 3): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (8, 6): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (9, 2): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (9, 4): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles
- Edge (9, 7): Shared connections = {} -> No triangles

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
The unique triangles found are: <0, 1, 5>.
