Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method sorts the vertices based on their connections from least to most:

Vertex 8 has 0 connections.
Vertices 2 and 6 have 1 connection each.
Vertices 4 and 7 have 2 connections each.
Vertices 3 and 5 have 3 connections each.
Vertices 0 and 1 have 4 connections each.
Vertex 9 has 6 connections.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Starting with edge (0, 1): Check for shared connections.
  - Both vertices have connections with vertices 5 and 9.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 5>.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 1, 9>.

- Moving to edge (0, 5):
  - Both vertices have connection with vertex 9.
    - Triangle formed: <0, 5, 9>.

- Considering edge (0, 9):
  - No triangle formed as the condition doesn't meet.

- Skipping edge (1, 0) as we already considered it.

- Moving to edge (1, 2):
  - No triangle formed as vertex 2 has only 1 connection.

- Considering edge (1, 3):
  - Triangle formed: <1, 3, 9>.

- Moving to edge (1, 7):
  - No triangle formed as vertex 7 has 2 connections.

- Skipping edge (2, 1) as we already considered it.

- Considering edge (2, 6):
  - No triangle formed as vertex 6 has 1 connection.

- Skipping remaining edges involving vertices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as they do not meet the conditions for counting triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [4] inside brackets, and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 9>, and <1, 3, 9>.
