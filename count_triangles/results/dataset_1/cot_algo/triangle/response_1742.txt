Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph.

First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 6: 5 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Next, we will relabel the nodes in the order of ascending degrees:
Node 0 -> 0
Node 3 -> 1
Node 4 -> 2
Node 7 -> 3
Node 1 -> 4
Node 5 -> 5
Node 8 -> 6
Node 2 -> 7
Node 9 -> 8
Node 6 -> 9

Now, we will check the edges to count the triangles:
- Edge (0, 1): None
- Edge (1, 2): None
- Edge (1, 8): Triangle <1, 8, 9>
- Edge (2, 3): None
- Edge (2, 5): None
- Edge (2, 6): None
- Edge (3, 6): None
- Edge (4, 6): Triangle <4, 6, 9>
- Edge (4, 8): Triangle <4, 6, 8>
- Edge (5, 7): None
- Edge (5, 9): Triangle <5, 8, 9>
- Edge (6, 8): None

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 8, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 8>
