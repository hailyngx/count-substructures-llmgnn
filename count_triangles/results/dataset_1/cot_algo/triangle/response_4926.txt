Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method is as follows:

Node 0: Degree 5
Node 1: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 6
Node 6: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 5

Using this ordering, we can now count the triangles. 

There are a total of [32] triangles in the graph.

The unique triangles found are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<2, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
