Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
Node 0: 4 connections
Node 1: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 3: 3 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Next, we'll relabel the vertices as follows:
Node 1 (degree 1) -> A
Node 5 (degree 1) -> B
Node 2 (degree 2) -> C
Node 4 (degree 2) -> D
Node 6 (degree 2) -> E
Node 7 (degree 2) -> F
Node 3 (degree 3) -> G
Node 8 (degree 4) -> H
Node 0 (degree 4) -> I
Node 9 (degree 4) -> J

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph but only consider cases where the lower labeled vertex has fewer connections.

Using the degree-based ordering method, we find the following triangles:
- <B, A, J>
- <A, C, I>
- <A, D, I>
- <B, D, I>
- <D, C, I>
- <B, E, I>
- <B, E, F>
- <F, E, I>
- <F, E, J>
- <C, G, I>
- <D, G, I>
- <F, G, I>
- <H, G, I>
- <F, G, J>
- <F, H, J>
- <D, H, I>
- <D, J, I>
- <H, I, J>
- <J, I, G>
- <H, I, G>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [20].
