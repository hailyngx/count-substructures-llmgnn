Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees in increasing order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 9: Degree 1
- Node 3: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 5

Now, we will count the triangles formed by looking at the edges and shared connections among vertices with lower labels:

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <4, 6, 8>

Count of triangles: [5]
