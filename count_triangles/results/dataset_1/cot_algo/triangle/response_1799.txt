Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices will be: 9, 5, 0, 2, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8, 1.

Now, we will check each edge starting from the one with the lower labeled vertex:

(0, 1): Shared connections: ()
(0, 2): Shared connections: (4)
(0, 4): Shared connections: ()
(1, 0): Shared connections: ()
(1, 6): Shared connections: ()
(1, 7): Shared connections: ()
(1, 8): Shared connections: ()
(2, 0): Shared connections: (4)
(2, 4): Shared connections: ()
(3, 5): Shared connections: ()
(3, 6): Shared connections: ()
(3, 7): Shared connections: ()
(3, 8): Shared connections: ()
(4, 0): Shared connections: ()
(4, 2): Shared connections: ()
(5, 3): Shared connections: ()
(6, 1): Shared connections: ()
(6, 3): Shared connections: ()
(6, 7): Shared connections: ()
(6, 8): Shared connections: ()
(7, 1): Shared connections: ()
(7, 3): Shared connections: ()
(7, 6): Shared connections: ()
(8, 1): Shared connections: ()
(8, 3): Shared connections: ()
(8, 6): Shared connections: ()
(8, 9): Shared connections: ()

Total number of triangles: [3]

Unique triangles: <0, 1, 8>, <3, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
