Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree, the order becomes: 2, 9, 3, 6, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and analyzing the given edges, we find the following triangles:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <5, 4, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].
