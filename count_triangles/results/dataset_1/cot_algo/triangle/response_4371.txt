Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are:
Node 0 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 2 has degree 4
Node 8 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 5
Node 9 has degree 5
Node 1 has degree 6
Node 5 has degree 6
Node 3 has degree 7

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles as follows:

Triangles:
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 7, 8>
<2, 7, 8>
<3, 0, 1>
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 1, 2>
<3, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13].
