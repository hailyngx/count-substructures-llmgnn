Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method works as follows:

1. Sort vertices by their number of connections:
    - Node 3: Degree 1
    - Node 7: Degree 2
    - Node 0: Degree 2
    - Node 9: Degree 2
    - Node 4: Degree 3
    - Node 8: Degree 3
    - Node 6: Degree 3
    - Node 1: Degree 4
    - Node 5: Degree 5
    - Node 2: Degree 5

2. Relabel the vertices accordingly:
    - Node 3 -> Node 0
    - Node 7 -> Node 1
    - Node 0 -> Node 2
    - Node 9 -> Node 3
    - Node 4 -> Node 4
    - Node 8 -> Node 5
    - Node 6 -> Node 6
    - Node 1 -> Node 7
    - Node 5 -> Node 8
    - Node 2 -> Node 9

Triangles can be identified by checking shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 1, 2>
- Triangle <1, 2, 6>
- Triangle <1, 2, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>
- Triangle <2, 5, 8>
- Triangle <2, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 6, 8>
- Triangle <2, 6, 9>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
