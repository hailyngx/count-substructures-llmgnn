Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

Node degrees:  
Node 0: degree 5  
Node 1: degree 3  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 5: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 4  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 3  

Sorting nodes by degree in ascending order:  
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 5, 6, 7, 0  

Calculating the number of triangles:  
For each edge, we check if the low-degree node has fewer connections.  

Triangles:  
Total number of triangles: [8]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 1, 8>  
<0, 2, 7>  
<0, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 6, 7>  
<1, 8, 9>  
<5, 6, 7>  
<5, 7, 8>
