Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their connections from least to most, the new labeling of the nodes is as follows: 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 8.  
Node 9 is connected to all other nodes.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can observe the following triangles in the graph: 

<0, 3, 7>    
<1, 4, 5>    
<2, 4, 5>    
<2, 4, 9>    
<2, 5, 9>    
<3, 4, 7>    
<3, 5, 6>    
<3, 5, 7>    
<3, 6, 8>    
<4, 7, 9>    
<5, 1, 9>    

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [11].
