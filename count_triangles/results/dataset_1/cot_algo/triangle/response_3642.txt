Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the relabeling would be as follows: 
- Node 0 with degree 4 
- Node 1 with degree 4 
- Node 4 with degree 3 
- Node 7 with degree 3 
- Node 2 with degree 3 
- Node 3 with degree 3 
- Node 8 with degree 2 
- Node 9 with degree 2 
- Node 5 with degree 2 
- Node 6 with degree 1 

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the triangles: 

Triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <1, 9, 2>

Total number of triangles: [8]
