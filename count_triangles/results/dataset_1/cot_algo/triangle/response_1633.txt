Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices will be:  
Node 0 (Degree 4)  
Node 1 (Degree 3)  
Node 4 (Degree 3)  
Node 7 (Degree 2)  
Node 5 (Degree 2)  
Node 6 (Degree 2)  
Node 9 (Degree 2)  
Node 2 (Degree 1)  
Node 8 (Degree 2)  
Node 3 (Degree 4)  

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine each edge:  
- Edge (0, 1): Nodes 0 and 1 share a connection with Node 8 forming a triangle <0, 1, 8>.  
- Edge (0, 5): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (0, 6): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (0, 8): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (1, 0): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (1, 3): Nodes 1 and 3 already have a shared connection with Node 8 forming a triangle <1, 3, 8>.  
- Edge (1, 8): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (2, 3): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (3, 1): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (3, 2): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (3, 9): Nodes 3 and 9 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 9, 7>.  
- Edge (4, 3): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (4, 6): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (4, 7): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (5, 0): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (6, 0): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (6, 4): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (7, 4): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (7, 9): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (8, 0): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (8, 1): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (9, 3): No triangles are formed.  
- Edge (9, 7): No triangles are formed.  

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 8>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, and <3, 9, 7>.
