Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After relabeling the vertices based on the number of connections, we get the following sorted list of vertices: 
Vertices: 1, 4, 9, 6, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 0

Checking for triangles based on the Degree-Based Ordering method:
- Edge (0, 5): vertices 0 and 5 share a connection with vertex 2 forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (0, 7): no triangles formed as vertex 0 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (0, 8): vertices 0 and 8 share a connection with vertex 6 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (1, 3): no triangles formed as vertex 1 has more connections than vertex 3.
- Edge (2, 5): no triangles formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
- Edge (2, 6): no triangles formed as vertex 2 has more connections than vertex 6.
- Edge (3, 1): no triangles formed as vertex 3 has more connections than vertex 1.
- Edge (3, 4): vertices 3 and 4 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (3, 9): vertices 3 and 9 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (4, 3): vertices 3 and 4 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 4, 7>.
- Edge (4, 7): no triangles formed as vertex 4 has more connections than vertex 7.
- Edge (5, 0): vertices 0 and 5 share a connection with vertex 2 forming a triangle <0, 2, 5>.
- Edge (5, 2): no triangles formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
- Edge (5, 9): vertices 5 and 9 share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (6, 2): no triangles formed as vertex 6 has more connections than vertex 2.
- Edge (6, 7): no triangles formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
- Edge (6, 8): vertices 6 and 8 share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (7, 0): no triangles formed as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 0.
- Edge (7, 4): no triangles formed as vertex 7 has more connections than vertex 4.
- Edge (7, 6): no triangles formed as both vertices have the same number of connections.
- Edge (7, 8): vertices 7 and 8 share a connection forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 0): no triangles formed as vertex 8 has more connections than vertex 0.
- Edge (8, 6): vertices 6 and 8 share a connection with vertex 0 forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 7): vertices 7 and 8 share a connection forming a triangle <0, 6, 8>.
- Edge (8, 9): vertices 8 and 9 share a connection with vertex 5 forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 3): vertices 3 and 9 share a connection forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 5): vertices 5 and 9 share a connection with vertex 3 forming a triangle <3, 5, 9>.
