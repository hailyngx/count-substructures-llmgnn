Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:  
Vertex 0 - 3 connections  
Vertex 1 - 3 connections  
Vertex 5 - 4 connections  
Vertex 7 - 4 connections  
Vertex 8 - 3 connections  
Vertex 9 - 3 connections  
Vertex 3 - 5 connections  
Vertex 6 - 5 connections  
Vertex 2 - 7 connections  
Vertex 4 - 7 connections  

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:  
- Edge (0, 2) won't form a triangle because vertex 0 has fewer connections than vertex 2.  
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle <0, 2, 4>.  
- Edge (0, 6) forms a triangle <0, 2, 6>.  
- Edge (1, 2) won't form a triangle because vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 2.  
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle <0, 1, 4>.  
- Edge (1, 7) won't form a triangle because vertex 1 has fewer connections than vertex 7.  
- Edge (3, 2) forms a triangle <0, 2, 3>.  
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle <0, 3, 4>.  
- Edge (3, 5) won't form a triangle because vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 5.  
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle <0, 3, 6>.  
- Edge (3, 8) won't form a triangle because vertex 3 has fewer connections than vertex 8.  
- Edge (4, 5) won't form a triangle because vertex 4 has fewer connections than vertex 5.  
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle <0, 4, 6>.  
- Edge (5, 7) won't form a triangle because vertex 5 has fewer connections than vertex 7.  
- Edge (8, 9) won't form a triangle because vertex 8 has fewer connections than vertex 9.  

Total number of triangles: [5]  
Unique triangles:  
<0, 2, 4>  
<0, 2, 6>  
<0, 3, 4>  
<0, 3, 6>  
<0, 4, 6>
