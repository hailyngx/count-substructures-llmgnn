Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are as follows: 

Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 4 connections.
Node 3 has 4 connections.
Node 1 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 5 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.
Node 2 has 6 connections.
Node 7 has 6 connections.

Based on the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections. Therefore, we will consider the following edges:

(0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 9) (8, 9)

By examining shared connections between the vertices of these edges, we find the following triangles:

<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 9, 1>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [10].
