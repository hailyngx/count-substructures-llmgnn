Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order:
Vertices: 5, 1, 4, 8, 9, 6, 0, 7, 3, 2

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
5 -> 0 connections -> 0
1 -> 0 connections -> 1
4 -> 1 connection -> 2
8 -> 1 connection -> 3
9 -> 2 connections -> 4
6 -> 3 connections -> 5
0 -> 4 connections -> 6
7 -> 4 connections -> 7
3 -> 4 connections -> 8
2 -> 5 connections -> 9

Now, let's count the triangles based on the given edges:
- Triangle <0, 2, 4> (Shared connection with vertex 2)
- Triangle <0, 2, 9> (Shared connection with vertex 2)
- Triangle <0, 3, 7> (Shared connection with vertex 7)
- Triangle <0, 6, 7> (Shared connection with vertex 0)
- Triangle <2, 3, 9> (Shared connection with vertex 2)
- Triangle <2, 7, 9> (Shared connection with vertex 9)
- Triangle <6, 7, 8> (Shared connection with vertex 7)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
