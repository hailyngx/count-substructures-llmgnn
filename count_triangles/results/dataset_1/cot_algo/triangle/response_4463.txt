Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels will be:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 0
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will examine the edges by comparing the vertices' labels and degrees. 

Considering each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 5) forms a triangle with node 0, 5, and their common neighbor 1.
- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with node 1, 2, and their common neighbor 4.
- Edge (1, 4) forms a triangle with node 1, 4, and their common neighbor 6.
- Edge (1, 9) does not form a triangle.
- Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with node 2, 8, and their common neighbor 6.
- Edge (4, 6) forms a triangle with node 4, 6, and their common neighbor 7.
- Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with node 4, 7, and their common neighbor 6.
- Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with node 7, 8, and their common neighbor 6.

Counting the total number of triangles and listing the unique ones:
Total triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <0, 1, 5>, <1, 2, 4>, <4, 6, 7>, <6, 7, 8>
