Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following labels for the nodes:  
Node 3: 0 connections  
Node 1: 1 connection  
Nodes 4 and 6: 2 connections  
Nodes 7 and 9: 3 connections  
Nodes 0, 8, and 2: 4 connections  
Nodes 5: 5 connections  

Next, we'll count the triangles formed by each edge, ensuring we only count each triangle once:

Triangles:
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
<4, 5, 7>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 5, 8>

Total number of triangles: [8]
