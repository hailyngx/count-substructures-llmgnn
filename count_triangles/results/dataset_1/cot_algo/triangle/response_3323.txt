Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections. The sorted list of vertices is: [3, 9, 5, 7, 4, 8, 6, 2, 0, 1]

After relabeling the nodes accordingly, the edges to consider are: (3, 1), (9, 1), (5, 6), (7, 4), (4, 2), (8, 5), (6, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1)

Counting the number of triangles formed:
- For edge (3, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (9, 1): No triangles formed.
- For edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
- For edge (7, 4): No triangles formed.
- For edge (4, 2): No triangles formed.
- For edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
- For edge (6, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 6>
- For edge (2, 0): Triangle formed: <0, 1, 2>
- For edge (0, 1): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2] and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 6> and <0, 1, 2>.
