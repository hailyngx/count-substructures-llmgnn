Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 9
|    
1 -- 2 -- 8
|  / |  / |
4 -- 5 -- 7
   / |
  6 -- 3
```

After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the new labels are: 
Vertices: 3, 0, 9, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6, 1, 5.

Calculating the triangles:
1. Triangle <1, 2, 4>
2. Triangle <1, 4, 5>
3. Triangle <1, 5, 6>
4. Triangle <1, 5, 8>
5. Triangle <1, 6, 7>
6. Triangle <2, 5, 8>
7. Triangle <4, 5, 6>
8. Triangle <4, 5, 7>
9. Triangle <5, 6, 8>
10. Triangle <5, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [10]
