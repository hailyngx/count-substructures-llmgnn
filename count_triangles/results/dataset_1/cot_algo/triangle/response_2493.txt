Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree in ascending order, we have the following new labels for the vertices:  

- Node 6 (degree 0)
- Node 8 (degree 1)
- Node 5 (degree 2)
- Node 3 (degree 2)
- Node 9 (degree 2)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 4)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 0 (degree 5)
- Node 4 (degree 6)

Next, we will explore each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1) forms a triangle with Node 2: <0, 1, 2>.
- Edge (0, 2) forms a triangle with Node 7: <0, 2, 7>.
- Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with Nodes 1 and 7: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 4, 7>.
- Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with Node 1: <0, 1, 7>.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 triangles in the given graph: [4].
