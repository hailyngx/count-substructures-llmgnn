Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering for the given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 7, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0

Based on the ordering, we will analyze the edges (lowest label vertex first) to count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Shared connections with 0: 4, 6. Triangle formed: <0, 2, 4>.
2. Edge (0, 4): Shared connections with 0: 2. Triangle formed: <0, 4, 2>.
3. Edge (0, 6): No triangles formed.
4. Edge (0, 7): No triangles formed.
5. Edge (0, 8): Shared connections with 0: 1. Triangle formed: <0, 8, 1>.
6. Edge (0, 9): No triangles formed.
7. Edge (1, 2): No triangles formed.
8. Edge (1, 3): No triangles formed.
9. Edge (1, 4): No triangles formed.
10. Edge (1, 8): No triangles formed.
11. Edge (1, 9): No triangles formed.
12. Edge (2, 3): No triangles formed.
13. Edge (3, 6): No triangles formed.
14. Edge (4, 7): No triangles formed.
15. Edge (4, 8): Shared connections with 4: 0. Triangle formed: <4, 8, 0>.
16. Edge (5, 6): No triangles formed.
17. Edge (5, 8): No triangles formed.
18. Edge (6, 3): No triangles formed.
19. Edge (8, 5): No triangles formed.
20. Edge (8, 9): No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 2>, <0, 8, 1>, <4, 8, 0>.
