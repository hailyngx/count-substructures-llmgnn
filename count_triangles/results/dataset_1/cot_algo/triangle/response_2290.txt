Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 3: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 8: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 1: Not included in the edges, hence 0 connections
- Node 2: 4 connections
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 4: 5 connections
- Node 9: 6 connections

Now, we will use the Degree-Based Ordering method to find the number of triangles:
1. Start with the edge (0, 5): Both nodes have 1 connection each.
2. Move to the edge (2, 3): Node 3 has 1 connection, and Node 2 has 4 connections. Since Node 3 has fewer connections, we proceed.
3. The shared connection between Node 2 and Node 3 forms a triangle: <2, 3, 0>.
4. Continue with the edge (2, 4): Node 4 has 5 connections, and Node 2 has 4 connections. Proceed.
5. The shared connections between Node 2 and Node 4 form triangles: <2, 4, 6> and <2, 4, 9>.
6. Move to the edge (2, 5): Node 5 has 4 connections, and Node 2 has 4 connections. Proceed.
7. The shared connection between Node 2 and Node 5 forms a triangle: <2, 5, 0>.
8. Continue checking the remaining edges following the same process and counting the triangles formed:
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 9, 5>
- <9, 7, 8>

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
