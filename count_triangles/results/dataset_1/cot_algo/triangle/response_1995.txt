Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
(2) - 3 connections
(3) - 2 connections
(7) - 2 connections
(4) - 3 connections
(6) - 3 connections
(5) - 4 connections
(8) - 6 connections
(9) - 1 connection

Proceeding with the Degree-Based Ordering method:
1. Edge (2, 3):
    - Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 5.
    - No shared connections, so no triangles.

2. Edge (2, 5):
    - Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 5.
    - Shared connection with vertex 8.
    - Triangle: <2, 5, 8>

3. Edge (2, 8):
    - Vertex 2 has fewer connections than vertex 8.
    - Shared connection with vertices 5 and 9.
    - Triangles: <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>

4. Edge (2, 9):
    - Both vertices have fewer connections than vertex 8.
    - No shared connections, so no triangles.

The total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are: <2, 5, 8>, <2, 8, 9>.
