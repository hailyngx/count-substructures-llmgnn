Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in this graph is as follows:

Nodes sorted by degree:
Node 1: 0 edges
Node 6: 1 edge
Node 4: 1 edge
Node 7: 1 edge
Node 9: 1 edge
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 3: 2 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 5: 6 edges

Based on the sorting, we will start counting triangles by considering edges in the order of least connected node first.

The triangles found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 3>
<2, 5, 4>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 4, 3>
<5, 8, 2>
<5, 8, 3>
<6, 3, 5>

Total number of triangles: [13]
