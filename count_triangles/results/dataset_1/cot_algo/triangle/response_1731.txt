Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in ascending order, the vertices are relabeled as follows: 

Node 1 - 0 connections  
Node 0 - 3 connections  
Node 7 - 4 connections  
Node 5 - 4 connections  
Node 6 - 4 connections  
Node 8 - 4 connections  
Node 4 - 5 connections  
Node 9 - 6 connections  
Node 2 - 6 connections  
Node 3 - 6 connections  

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles and unique triangles in the graph:  

Total number of triangles: [6]  
Unique triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>
