Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degrees, we have the following order:
Node 3: degree 1
Node 5: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 1: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 9: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Based on this ordering, we can now count the triangles formed:
1. Looking at node 3 (degree 1): No triangles can be formed.
2. Looking at node 5 (degree 1): No triangles can be formed.
3. Looking at node 8 (degree 1): No triangles can be formed.
4. Looking at node 1 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed.
5. Looking at node 5 (degree 2): No triangles can be formed.
6. Looking at node 9 (degree 3):
   - Triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 9, 3>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 9, 4>
7. Looking at node 4 (degree 4):
   - Triangles: <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 7>
8. Looking at node 7 (degree 5):
   - Triangles: <1, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 5>, <2, 7, 5>, <2, 4, 7>
9. Looking at node 2 (degree 5):
   - Triangles: <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 9>
10. Looking at node 6 (degree 6):
   - Triangles: <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 9>, <6, 9, 7>, <2, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [12].
