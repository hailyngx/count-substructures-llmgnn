Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:

Node 4 - 0 connections
Node 2 - 1 connection
Node 7 - 1 connection
Node 8 - 2 connections
Node 6 - 2 connections
Node 5 - 3 connections
Node 3 - 3 connections
Node 1 - 4 connections
Node 9 - 5 connections
Node 0 - 5 connections

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles:
- Edge (1, 2) with Node 1 and Node 2: No triangles.
- Edge (1, 3) with Node 1 and Node 3: No triangles.
- Edge (1, 5) with Node 1 and Node 5: Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (1, 9) with Node 1 and Node 9: Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (2, 1) with Node 2 and Node 1: No triangles.
- Edge (3, 0) with Node 3 and Node 0: No triangles.
- Edge (3, 1) with Node 3 and Node 1: No triangles.
- Edge (4, 8) with Node 4 and Node 8: No triangles.
- Edge (4, 9) with Node 4 and Node 9: No triangles.
- Edge (5, 0) with Node 5 and Node 0: No triangles.
- Edge (5, 1) with Node 5 and Node 1: Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (5, 7) with Node 5 and Node 7: No triangles.
- Edge (6, 0) with Node 6 and Node 0: No triangles.
- Edge (6, 8) with Node 6 and Node 8: No triangles.
- Edge (7, 5) with Node 7 and Node 5: No triangles.
- Edge (7, 9) with Node 7 and Node 9: No triangles.
- Edge (8, 4) with Node 8 and Node 4: No triangles.
- Edge (8, 6) with Node 8 and Node 6: No triangles.
- Edge (9, 0) with Node 9 and Node 0: Triangle <0, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 1) with Node 9 and Node 1: Triangle <1, 5, 9>.
- Edge (9, 4) with Node 9 and Node 4: No triangles.
- Edge (9, 7) with Node 9 and Node 7: No triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3] and the unique triangles found are <1, 5, 9>, <0, 5, 9>.
