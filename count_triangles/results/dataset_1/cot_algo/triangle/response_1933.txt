Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees from least to most connections, the new ordering is: 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 0, 8, 7, 5, 9.

Starting from the edge with the lower labeled vertex, we can identify the following unique triangles:
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [9].
