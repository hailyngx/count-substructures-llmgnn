Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices are:
- Vertex 1 (degree 4)
- Vertex 5 (degree 2)
- Vertex 2 (degree 1)
- Vertex 6 (degree 2)
- Vertex 8 (degree 2)
- Vertex 4 (degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (degree 4)
- Vertex 7 (degree 5)
- Vertex 9 (degree 4)
- Vertex 0 (degree 5)

Following the degree-based ordering method, we will analyze the edges in the order:
(2, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (1, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [5].

The triangles found in the graph are:
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
