Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
After relabeling the nodes based on their degrees, we have:
Nodes: 1(3), 2(4), 3(3), 4(1), 5(1), 7(4), 8(4), 9(3)

The edges sorted with respect to the lower labeled vertex are:
(1, 9), (4, 2), (5, 1), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7)

Now we count the triangles formed by the shared connections:
Total number of triangles: [2]
Unique triangles: <1, 8, 9>, <2, 7, 8>
