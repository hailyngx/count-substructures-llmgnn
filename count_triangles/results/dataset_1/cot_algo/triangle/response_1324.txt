Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
0 - 3 connections
2 - 2 connections
4 - 2 connections
5 - 2 connections
9 - 1 connection
6 - 4 connections
8 - 4 connections
1 - 6 connections
3 - 3 connections
7 (not listed) - 0 connections

Now, we will relabel the vertices:
0 - 0 connections
2 - 1 connection
4 - 1 connection
5 - 1 connection
9 - 2 connections
6 - 3 connections
8 - 4 connections
1 - 5 connections
3 - 6 connections
7 (not listed) - 7 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method and the edge list provided, we can count the number of triangles:

Triangles:
[6]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 3>
