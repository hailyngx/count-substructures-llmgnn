Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections

Now let's relabel the nodes based on the number of connections (from least to most):
Node 3 -> Node 1
Node 4 -> Node 2
Node 9 -> Node 3
Node 1 -> Node 4
Node 5 -> Node 5
Node 6 -> Node 6
Node 7 -> Node 7
Node 2 -> Node 8

Now we will check for triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Triangles: <1, 4, 9> <2, 4, 6> <2, 5, 3> <2, 5, 7> <4, 6, 9> <6, 7, 9>
Total number of triangles: [6]
