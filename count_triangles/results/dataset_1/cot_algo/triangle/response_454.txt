Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 0: 6 connections
Vertex 9: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 4 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 8 connections

Next, we'll proceed through the edges according to the rule where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Checking edge (0, 3):
Vertices 0 and 3 share connections with vertices 2 and 8, forming the triangle <0, 2, 3>.

Checking edge (0, 5):
Vertices 0 and 5 share connections with vertices 2, 6, and 8, forming triangles <0, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, and <0, 8, 5>.

Checking edge (0, 6):
Vertices 0 and 6 share connections with vertices 1, 2, 5, and 8, forming triangles <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, and <0, 5, 6>.

Checking edge (0, 7):
No triangle is formed.

Checking edge (0, 8):
Vertices 0 and 8 share connections with all other vertices, forming triangles <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, and <0, 9, 8>.

Checking edge (0, 9):
Vertices 0 and 9 share connections with vertices 2, 8, and 7, forming triangles <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, and <0, 8, 9>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is 17, and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 9, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 7, 9>, <2, 1, 4>.
