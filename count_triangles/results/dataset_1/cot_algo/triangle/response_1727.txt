Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degrees:

Vertex 0: 2 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 2 connections
Vertex 4: 4 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 1 connection
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 5 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Based on the degrees, the sorted order of vertices would be: 6, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 7, 8.

Now, we will check for triangles:

- Triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Triangle <1, 7, 8>
- Triangle <4, 5, 8>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>
- Triangle <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [5].
