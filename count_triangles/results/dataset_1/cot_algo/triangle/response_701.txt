Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will help in counting the number of triangles in the given graph. 

The vertices sorted by their number of connections are:
Vertex 0: Degree 1
Vertex 9: Degree 1
Vertex 5: Degree 2
Vertex 8: Degree 3
Vertex 4: Degree 3
Vertex 6: Degree 4
Vertex 3: Degree 4
Vertex 1: Degree 4
Vertex 7: Degree 4
Vertex 2: Degree 4

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:

Triangle 1: <2, 6, 8>
Triangle 2: <2, 6, 7>
Triangle 3: <2, 7, 4>
Triangle 4: <6, 7, 4>

The total number of triangles in the given graph is [4].
