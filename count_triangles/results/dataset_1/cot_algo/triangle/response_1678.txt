Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles in the given graph:

We sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 4 has 0 connections
- Vertex 0 has 2 connections
- Vertex 1 has 2 connections
- Vertex 8 has 2 connections
- Vertex 3 has 3 connections
- Vertex 5 has 3 connections
- Vertex 9 has 4 connections
- Vertex 7 has 5 connections
- Vertex 6 has 5 connections
- Vertex 2 has 5 connections

Relabel the vertices:
- Relabeled Vertex 4 = 0
- Relabeled Vertex 0 = 1
- Relabeled Vertex 1 = 2
- Relabeled Vertex 8 = 3
- Relabeled Vertex 3 = 4
- Relabeled Vertex 5 = 5
- Relabeled Vertex 9 = 6
- Relabeled Vertex 7 = 7
- Relabeled Vertex 6 = 8
- Relabeled Vertex 2 = 9

Now, we go through each edge considering only the ones where the vertex with lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <1, 2, 0>
- Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 2: <1, 7, 2>
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <3, 4, 0>
- Edge (3, 6) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <3, 6, 0>
- Edge (3, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 6: <3, 9, 6>
- Edge (4, 9) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <4, 9, 0>
- Edge (6, 7) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <6, 7, 0>
- Edge (6, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <6, 8, 0>
- Edge (7, 8) forms a triangle with vertex 0: <7, 8, 0>

Counting all the triangles above, we find a total of 8 triangles inside brackets: [8].
