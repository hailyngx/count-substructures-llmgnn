Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting nodes by their degree in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are as follows:
0 -> 7
1 -> 4
2 -> 3
3 -> 1
4 -> 6
5 -> 2
6 -> 5
7 -> 0
8 -> 8
9 -> 9

The edges in the new ordering are:
(3, 0) (7, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (1, 4) (5, 9) (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (5, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (6, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (7, 9) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (0, 5) (2, 9) (5, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (6, 9) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (7, 9)

Using these edges, we can count the number of triangles and find the unique triangles:
There are 3 triangles in total.

The unique triangles are:
<0, 1, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 9>
