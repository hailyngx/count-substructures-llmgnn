Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 2
Node 0: degree 3
Node 2: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 9: degree 5
Node 3: degree 6

Now, we will check for triangles by examining the edges:
- Edge (0, 3) forms a triangle with nodes 0, 3, 1: <0, 3, 1>
- Edge (0, 9) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has higher degree)
- Edge (1, 2) does not form a triangle (vertex 2 has higher degree)
- Edge (1, 3) does not form a triangle (vertex 1 has higher degree)
- Edge (1, 9) forms a triangle with nodes 1, 9, 0: <1, 9, 0>
- Edge (2, 1) does not form a triangle (vertex 2 has higher degree)
- Edge (3, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 0, 9: <3, 0, 9>
- Edge (3, 1) does not form a triangle (vertex 1 has higher degree)
- Edge (3, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 3, 4, 5: <3, 4, 5>
- Edge (3, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 3 has higher degree)
- Edge (4, 3) does not form a triangle (vertex 4 has higher degree)
- Edge (4, 5) does not form a triangle (vertex 4 has higher degree)
- Edge (4, 7) does not form a triangle (vertex 4 has higher degree)
- Edge (5, 3) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has higher degree)
- Edge (5, 4) does not form a triangle (vertex 5 has higher degree)
- Edge (6, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 6 has lower degree)
- Edge (6, 9) does not form a triangle (vertex 6 has lower degree)
- Edge (7, 4) does not form a triangle (vertex 7 has lower degree)
- Edge (8, 6) does not form a triangle (vertex 6 has lower degree)
- Edge (8, 9) does not form a triangle (vertex 8 has lower degree)
- Edge (9, 0) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has higher degree)
- Edge (9, 1) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has higher degree)
- Edge (9, 6) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has higher degree)
- Edge (9, 8) does not form a triangle (vertex 9 has higher degree)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 3, 1>, <1, 9, 0>, and <3, 4, 5>.
