Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of connections each node has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 1 connection
- Node 2: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 4: 4 connections
- Node 5: 1 connection
- Node 6: 2 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

Now, we relabel the nodes based on their number of connections:
- Node 1 (1 connection) -> Node A
- Node 2 (1 connection) -> Node B
- Node 5 (1 connection) -> Node C
- Node 3 (2 connections) -> Node D
- Node 6 (2 connections) -> Node E
- Node 8 (2 connections) -> Node F
- Node 0 (2 connections) -> Node G
- Node 9 (2 connections) -> Node H
- Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node I

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
- (G, D) (G, H) (A, E) (B, F) (D, G) (D, I) (I, D) (I, E) (I, F) (F, I) (E, I) (E, H)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- Triangle <D, G, H>
- Triangle <D, I, F>
- Triangle <E, I, F>
- Triangle <E, I, H>

Finally, output the total number of triangles in the graph:
