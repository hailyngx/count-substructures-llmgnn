Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 2: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 0: 7 connections
Node 6: 7 connections

Using the degree-based ordering, we will now count the number of triangles in the graph:

    Node 5 is connected to Node 8.
    Shared connections: None

4. Edge (7, 0):
    Node 7 is connected to Node 0.
    Shared connections: None

5. Edge (2, 0):
    Node 2 is connected to Node 0.
    Shared connections: None

6. Edge (8, 2):

    Node 6 is connected to Node 3.
    Shared connections: None

17. Edge (6, 4):
    Node 6 is connected to Node 4.
    Shared connections: None

18. Edge (6, 7):
    Node 6 is connected to Node 7.
    Shared connections: None

19. Edge (6, 8):

    Shared connections: None

25. Edge (4, 8):
    Node 4 is connected to Node 8.
    Shared connections: None

26. Edge (2, 8):
    Node 2 is connected to Node 8.
    Shared connections: None

27. Edge (7, 6):
    Node 7 is connected to Node 6.
    Shared connections: None

28. Edge (8, 3):
    Node 8 is connected to Node 3.
    Shared connections: None

By counting the triangles, we find that there are a total of 0 triangles.
Therefore, the number of triangles in the graph is [0].
