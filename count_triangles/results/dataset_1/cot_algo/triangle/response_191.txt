Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 1: 2 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 9: 2 edges
Node 7: 3 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 0: 6 edges
Node 8: 6 edges

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:

1. (0, 2): Shared connections with node 4 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
2. (0, 3): Shared connections with nodes 6 and 8 -> Triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 8>
3. (0, 4): Shared connection with node 8 -> Triangle <0, 4, 8>
4. (0, 5): No triangles
5. (0, 6): Shared connection with node 3 -> Triangle <0, 3, 6>
6. (0, 8): No triangles
7. (1, 2): No triangles
8. (1, 3): No triangles
9. (1, 4): No triangles
10. (2, 0): Shared connections with nodes 4 and 1 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
11. (2, 1): No triangles
12. (2, 4): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 1 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
13. (3, 0): Shared connections with nodes 6 and 8 -> Triangles <0, 3, 6> and <0, 3, 8>
14. (3, 1): No triangles
15. (3, 6): Shared connection with node 0 -> Triangle <0, 3, 6>
16. (3, 8): Shared connection with node 0 -> Triangles <0, 3, 8>
17. (4, 0): Shared connection with node 8 -> Triangle <0, 4, 8>
18. (4, 1): No triangles
19. (4, 2): Shared connections with nodes 0 and 1 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
20. (4, 7): No triangles
21. (4, 8): No triangles
22. (5, 0): No triangles
23. (5, 6): No triangles
24. (6, 0): Shared connection with node 3 -> Triangle <0, 3, 6>
25. (6, 3): Shared connection with node 0 -> Triangle <0, 3, 6>
26. (6, 5): No triangles
27. (6, 8): No triangles
28. (7, 4): No triangles
29. (7, 8): No triangles
30. (7, 9): No triangles
31. (8, 0): No triangles
32. (8, 3): Shared connection with node 0 -> Triangle <0, 3, 8>
33. (8, 4): No triangles
34. (8, 6): No triangles
35. (8, 7): No triangles
36. (8, 9): No triangles
37. (9, 7): No triangles
38. (9, 8): No triangles

After counting all the triangles, we have found a total of 7 unique triangles:
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 2, 4>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
