Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices along with their degrees:

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections

Next, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees in ascending order:

Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 3 connections
Vertex 6: 3 connections
Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 7: 5 connections
Vertex 8: 7 connections

Now, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the number of triangles:

1. (0, 3):
   Both have 3 connections, so proceed.
   Shared connections: 8
   Triangle formed: <0, 3, 8>

2. (0, 7):
   0 has 3 connections, and 7 has 5 connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connections: None

3. (0, 8):
   0 has 3 connections, and 8 has 7 connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connections: 3, 5, 6
   Triangles formed: <0, 3, 5> and <0, 3, 6> and <0, 5, 6>

4. (1, 2):
   Both have 3 connections, so proceed.
   Shared connections: None

5. (1, 5):
   1 has 3 connections, and 5 has 3 connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connections: None

6. (1, 6):
   1 has 3 connections, and 6 has 3 connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connections: None

7. (2, 8):
   2 has 2 connections, and 8 has 7 connections. So, proceed.
   Shared connections: 1, 3, 5, 6
   Triangle formed: <0, 1, 3>

Continuing with the rest of the edges, we find more triangles. The total number of triangles inside brackets is [6].
