Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method follows these steps:

1. Sort the vertices based on their degrees:
0: 3 connections
1: 4 connections
2: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
4: 3 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 1 connection
7: 4 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 2 connections

2. Relabel the vertices in ascending order based on their degrees:
Vertex 6 (1 connection) becomes Vertex 0
Vertex 5 (2 connections) becomes Vertex 1
Vertices 8 and 9 (2 connections) become Vertices 2 and 3
Vertices 0, 2, 3, and 4 (3 connections) become Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7
Vertices 1 and 7 (4 connections) become Vertices 8 and 9

3. Reconstruct the graph with the new labels:
Edges in the new graph:
(0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (5, 7) (7, 8)

4. Count the number of triangles:
Total number of triangles = 1
Unique triangles found: <3, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
