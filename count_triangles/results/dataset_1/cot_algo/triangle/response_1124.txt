Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, we have the following new vertex labels: 

Vertex 0: 3 connections
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 6: 2 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 1 connection
Vertex 9: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 4 connections
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 3: 6 connections

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will check for triangles using the edges in the graph. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

Based on the provided edges, the triangles formed are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 6, 0>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [11].
