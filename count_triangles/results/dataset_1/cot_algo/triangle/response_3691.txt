Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labeling is as follows:

Node 0 has degree 3
Node 1 has degree 5
Node 2 has degree 3
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 3
Node 6 has degree 2
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 2
Node 9 has degree 4

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now find the triangles in the graph. 

Calculating the number of triangles and listing them:

- Total number of triangles: [12]

Unique triangles:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 7, 4>
<0, 8, 1>
<1, 5, 2>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 3>
<2, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 1>
