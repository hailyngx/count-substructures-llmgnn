Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

    Vertex 5: 1 connection
    Vertex 3: 1 connection
    Vertex 7: 1 connection
    Vertex 6: 0 connections
    Vertex 10: 0 connections
    Vertex 1: 4 connections
    Vertex 8: 3 connections
    Vertex 4: 3 connections
    Vertex 2: 4 connections
    Vertex 9: 5 connections

Next, we need to consider each edge where the vertex with the smaller label has fewer connections. 

Edges to consider:
(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (8, 5), (8, 9), (4, 5)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:

<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 4, 9>

The total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
