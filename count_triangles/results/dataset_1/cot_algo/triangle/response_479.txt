Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree (number of connections). The sorted order for the given graph is as follows:
Node 9: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 2
Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 3
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 5

Now, we will go through each edge and count the triangles. only considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 1): Vertex 0 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 1 (Degree 3): Triangle <0, 1, X>.
Edge (0, 4): Vertex 0 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 4 (Degree 4): Triangle <0, 4, X>.
Edge (0, 8): Vertex 0 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 8 (Degree 4): Triangle <0, 8, X>.
Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 2 (Degree 2): Triangle <1, 2, X>.
Edge (1, 8): Vertex 1 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 8 (Degree 4): Triangle <1, 8, X>.
Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 4 (Degree 4): Triangle <3, 4, X>.
Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 (Degree 3) has shared connections with Vertex 5 (Degree 5): Triangle <3, 5, X>.
Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 (Degree 5) has shared connections with Vertex 7 (Degree 2): Triangle <5, 7, X>.
Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 (Degree 5) has shared connections with Vertex 8 (Degree 4): Triangle <5, 8, X>.
Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 (Degree 2) has shared connections with Vertex 8 (Degree 4): Triangle <7, 8, X>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [9].
