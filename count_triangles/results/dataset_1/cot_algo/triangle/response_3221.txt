Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the graph is as follows:

Vertices sorted by number of connections:
Node 2: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 6: degree 2
Node 9: degree 2
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 5
Node 0: degree 6

Following the rules of Degree-Based Ordering, we will iterate through the edges to count the triangles:

Triangles:
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 1, 5>
<7, 1, 0>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 5, 0>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 0>
<7, 8, 3>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 0, 5>
<8, 0, 7>
<8, 3, 2>
<8, 3, 4>
<8, 3, 6>

Total number of triangles: [18]
