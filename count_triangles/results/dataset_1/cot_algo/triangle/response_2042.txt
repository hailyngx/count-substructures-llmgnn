Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Nodes by degree:
0: 4
1: 3
3: 3
5: 3
6: 4
7: 3
2: 4
4: 5
8: 2
9: 2

Next, we relabel the nodes in ascending order of their connections:
0 -> 8
1 -> 9
3 -> 9
5 -> 9
6 -> 8
7 -> 9
2 -> 8
4 -> 7
8 -> 6
9 -> 5

Now, we will count the triangles:
Triangles: 
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 0, 4>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<5, 0, 6>
<5, 2, 6>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 0, 4>
<6, 1, 7>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 5, 9>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 3, 4>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 2, 0>
<9, 4, 5>
<9, 5, 6>

Total number of triangles: [27]
