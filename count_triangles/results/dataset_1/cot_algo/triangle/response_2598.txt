Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections they have. The vertices are then relabeled from least to most connections.
The sorted list of vertices based on the number of connections is: 2, 1, 5, 8, 7, 9, 6, 3, 0, 4.

After relabeling the vertices, we can start counting the triangles:

1. Triangles involving vertex 2:
   - No triangles can be formed with vertex 2 as it has only one connection.
   
2. Triangles involving vertex 1:
   - No triangles can be formed with vertex 1 as it has two connections.
   
3. Triangles involving vertex 5:
   - No triangles can be formed with vertex 5 as it has two connections.
   
4. Triangles involving vertex 8:
   - No triangles can be formed with vertex 8 as it has three connections.
   
5. Triangles involving vertex 7:
   - Triangle <7, 0, 5>.
   
6. Triangles involving vertex 9:
   - Triangle <9, 6, 0>.
   
7. Triangles involving vertex 6:
   - Triangle <6, 3, 0>.
   - Triangle <6, 7, 9>.
   
8. Triangles involving vertex 3:
   - Triangle <3, 0, 4>.
   - Triangle <3, 6, 4>.
   
9. Triangles involving vertex 0:
   - Triangle <0, 7, 5>.
   - Triangle <0, 6, 3>.
   - Triangle <0, 7, 9>.
   - Triangle <0, 4, 6>.
   - Triangle <0, 4, 7>.
   - Triangle <0, 4, 9>.

10. Triangles involving vertex 4:
    - Triangle <4, 0, 6>.
    - Triangle <4, 0, 7>.
    - Triangle <4, 0, 9>.
    - Triangle <4, 3, 6>.
    - Triangle <4, 3, 9>.
    - Triangle <4, 5, 0>.
    - Triangle <4, 5, 7>.
    - Triangle <4, 8, 6>.
    - Triangle <4, 8, 7>.
    - Triangle <4, 9, 6>.
    - Triangle <4, 9, 7>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [20].
