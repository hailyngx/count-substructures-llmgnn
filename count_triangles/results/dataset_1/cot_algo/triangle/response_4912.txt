Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we will sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 5 is connected to 1 node.
Nodes 0, 2, 4, 9 are connected to 2 nodes.
Nodes 1, 8 are connected to 3 nodes.
Nodes 6, 7 are connected to 4 nodes.
Node 3 is connected to 7 nodes.

Now, we will relabel the vertices according to their degrees in ascending order: 
Node 5 (degree 1) -> Node 0 (degree 2) -> Node 2 (degree 2) -> Node 4 (degree 2) -> Node 9 (degree 2) -> Node 1 (degree 3) -> Node 8 (degree 3) -> Node 6 (degree 4) -> Node 7 (degree 4) -> Node 3 (degree 7).

Next, we will count the triangles by checking the shared connections between vertices based on their labels:
- Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Triangle <0, 1, 9>
- Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Triangle <0, 3, 4>
- Triangle <0, 3, 7>
- Triangle <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle <0, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 3, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 9>
- Triangle <1, 6, 7>
- Triangle <1, 8, 9>
- Triangle <2, 3, 6>
- Triangle <4, 7, 8>

Total number of triangles: [13]
