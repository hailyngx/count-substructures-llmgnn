Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
After applying the Degree-Based Ordering method, the vertices will be relabeled as follows:
Node 0 has degree 1
Node 1 has degree 4
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 5
Node 4 has degree 3
Node 5 has degree 4
Node 6 has degree 3
Node 7 has degree 3
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 4

Now, we can count the number of triangles using the given edges and the relabeled vertices. The total number of triangles is 6 and they are: 
[<3, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 4>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 7, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 9>]
