Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, the vertices are relabeled as follows:
Vertex 0: degree 4
Vertex 1: degree 4
Vertex 2: degree 3
Vertex 3: degree 3
Vertex 4: degree 2
Vertex 5: degree 4
Vertex 6: degree 2
Vertex 7: degree 4
Vertex 8: degree 2
Vertex 9: degree 2

Following the degree-based ordering method, we consider the edges in the following order:
(4, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 3), (9, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (3, 7), (3, 9), 

By checking for shared connections, we find the following unique triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>, <0, 6, 1>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 9, 3>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
