Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degree, the new labels for the vertices will be:
- Vertex 1 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 3 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 5 (Degree 2)
- Vertex 7 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 9 (Degree 3)
- Vertex 0 (Degree 6)
- Vertex 2 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 4 (Degree 5)
- Vertex 6 (Degree 4)
- Vertex 8 (Degree 5)

Now, we will check for triangles by examining each edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections.

We find the following triangles: 
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <2, 6, 9>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9].
