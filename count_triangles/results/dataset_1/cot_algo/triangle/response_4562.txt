Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for each vertex will be:
Vertex 0 -> Degree 2
Vertex 1 -> Degree 1
Vertex 2 -> Degree 3
Vertex 8 -> Degree 1
Vertex 4 -> Degree 2
Vertex 6 -> Degree 2
Vertex 9 -> Degree 3
Vertex 5 -> Degree 1
Vertex 7 -> Degree 4
Vertex 3 -> Degree 0

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order:
(1, 0), (8, 2), (5, 9), (4, 6), (0, 7), (2, 4), (2, 9), (6, 7), (4, 2), (7, 9), (6, 4), (7, 0), (9, 5), (9, 7), (7, 6)

Calculating the number of triangles formed:
- Triangle <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle <4, 6, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle <2, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
