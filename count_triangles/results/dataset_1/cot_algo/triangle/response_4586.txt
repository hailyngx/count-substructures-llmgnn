Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we sort the vertices based on their degrees:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 3: 4 connections
Node 7: 6 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 6: 6 connections
Node 8: 4 connections

Based on the sorting, we relabel the nodes:
0 -> 0 (degree = 2)
1 -> 1 (degree = 4)
9 -> 2 (degree = 2)
4 -> 3 (degree = 2)
5 -> 4 (degree = 4)
3 -> 5 (degree = 4)
7 -> 6 (degree = 6)
2 -> 7 (degree = 4)
6 -> 8 (degree = 6)
8 -> 9 (degree = 4)

Now, we analyze the edges based on the relabeled vertices:
- From (0, 7): 0 has fewer connections than 6, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- From (1, 2): 1 has fewer connections than 7, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- From (1, 3): 1 has fewer connections than 5, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- From (1, 8): 1 has fewer connections than 9, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- From (2, 3): 2 has fewer connections than 5, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- From (2, 6): 2 has fewer connections than 8, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- From (3, 8): 3 has fewer connections than 9, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- From (5, 6): 5 has fewer connections than 8, but it doesn't lead to a triangle as there are no shared connections.
- From (5, 7): 5 has fewer connections than 6, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- From (5, 8): 5 has fewer connections than 9, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- From (6, 7): 6 has fewer connections than 8, so we check shared connections and find a triangle with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- From (7, 9): 7 has fewer connections than 9, but it doesn't lead to a triangle as there are no shared connections.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [6] and the unique triangles found are <0, 6, 7>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 3, 5>, and <2, 6, 8>.
