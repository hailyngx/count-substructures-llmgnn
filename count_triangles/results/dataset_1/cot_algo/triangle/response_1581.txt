Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labeling of the vertices is as follows:
Nodes: 3, 4, 1, 8, 2, 9, 0, 5, 6, 7

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles, we consider the edges in the following order:
1. (4, 6) - No triangles formed.
2. (1, 0) - No triangles formed.
3. (1, 7) - Triangle found: <1, 0, 7>
4. (8, 7) - Triangle found: <8, 7, 1>
5. (2, 7) - No triangles formed.
6. (2, 9) - Triangle found: <2, 9, 7>
7. (3, 5) - No triangles formed.
8. (3, 7) - No triangles formed.
9. (5, 6) - No triangles formed.
10. (5, 7) - No triangles formed.
11. (5, 9) - Triangle found: <5, 9, 7>
12. (6, 0) - Triangle found: <6, 0, 5>
13. (6, 4) - Triangle found: <6, 4, 5>
14. (6, 5) - No triangles formed.
15. (7, 0) - No triangles formed.
16. (7, 2) - No triangles formed.
17. (7, 8) - No triangles formed.
18. (7, 9) - No triangles formed.
19. (9, 2) - No triangles formed.
20. (9, 5) - No triangles formed.
21. (9, 7) - No triangles formed.

Total number of triangles: [5]
Unique triangles: <1, 0, 7>, <8, 7, 1>, <2, 9, 7>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 4, 5>
