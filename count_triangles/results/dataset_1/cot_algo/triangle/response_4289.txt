Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we sort the vertices based on their degree:

| Node | Degree |
|------|--------|
| 9    | 2      |
| 0    | 2      |
| 7    | 2      |
| 4    | 2      |
| 5    | 2      |
| 1    | 2      |
| 2    | 3      |
| 8    | 4      |
| 6    | 4      |
| 3    | 4      |

We will now relabel the vertices based on their degree (starting from 0):

| Node | New Label |
|------|-----------|
| 9    | 0         |
| 0    | 1         |
| 7    | 2         |
| 4    | 3         |
| 5    | 4         |
| 1    | 5         |
| 2    | 6         |
| 8    | 7         |
| 6    | 8         |
| 3    | 9         |

After relabeling, we have the following edges (sorted based on the lower labeled vertex):

(0, 1) (1, 3) (3, 6) (6, 8) (1, 4) (2, 5) (7, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) (0, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 6) (5, 2) (8, 6) 

Now, we count the triangles:
<1, 3, 6> <1, 4, 5> <1, 5, 4> <1, 4, 5> <3, 6, 0> <3, 8, 6> <3, 8, 0> <6, 8, 0> <3, 8, 6>

Total number of triangles: [9]
