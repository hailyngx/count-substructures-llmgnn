Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for each vertex are as follows: 

Node 4 has 0 connections.
Node 1 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 6 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 3 connections.
Node 0 has 4 connections.
Node 2 has 5 connections.
Node 8 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will analyze the edges starting with those involving vertices with lower labels and fewer connections. 

Analyzing the given edges, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 9>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<0, 8, 1>
<0, 8, 2>
<0, 8, 7>
<0, 8, 9>
<0, 9, 2>
<0, 9, 8>
<1, 8, 2>
<2, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 2>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [17].
