Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is: 

Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 1 connection.
Node 5 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 1 connection.
Node 9 has 1 connection.
Node 2 has 2 connections.
Node 7 has 3 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 0 has 3 connections.
Node 6 has 6 connections.

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will consider the edges in the following order: 
(4, 1), (9, 3), (8, 7), (1, 5), (1, 0), (0, 6), (2, 7), (2, 6), (5, 6), (6, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 1), and (6, 0).

After checking for shared connections between the vertices of each edge, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 6>, <1, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 7, 2>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [5].
