Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their degree:
- Vertex 0 has degree 1
- Vertex 6 has degree 2
- Vertex 9 has degree 2
- Vertex 8 has degree 2
- Vertex 7 has degree 3
- Vertex 4 has degree 3
- Vertex 2 has degree 3
- Vertex 5 has degree 4
- Vertex 3 has degree 4
- Vertex 1 has degree 6

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:
- Vertex 0 (degree 1) becomes Vertex 0
- Vertex 6 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 1
- Vertex 9 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 2
- Vertex 8 (degree 2) becomes Vertex 3
- Vertex 7 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 4
- Vertex 4 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 5
- Vertex 2 (degree 3) becomes Vertex 6
- Vertex 5 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 7
- Vertex 3 (degree 4) becomes Vertex 8
- Vertex 1 (degree 6) becomes Vertex 9

Now, let's list the edges based on the new labels:
- (0, 9) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles:
- We find 2 triangles: <1, 4, 5> and <2, 5, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
