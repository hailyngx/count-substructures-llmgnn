Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and relabeling them accordingly, the graph will be:

Nodes: 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9, 8, 1

The updated list of edges becomes:
(0, 8)
(0, 9)
(2, 1)
(3, 1)
(4, 1)
(5, 2)
(5, 8)
(6, 8)
(6, 9)
(7, 1)
(7, 9)
(8, 1)
(8, 2)
(8, 5)
(9, 1)
(9, 6)
(9, 7)

Now, we proceed with the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles:

[Total number of triangles: 2]

Unique triangles found:
<1, 8, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
