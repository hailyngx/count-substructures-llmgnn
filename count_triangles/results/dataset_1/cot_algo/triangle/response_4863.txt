Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0: 1 connection
2: 1 connection
5: 1 connection

7: 2 connections
6: 3 connections
9: 3 connections

3: 4 connections

Now, let's list the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

(0, 3)
(2, 7)
(5, 7)

Next, we will find the triangles formed by shared connections:

- Triangle <0, 3, 6> formed by shared connection 3
- Triangle <0, 3, 9> formed by shared connection 3

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: [2]
