Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, we can relabel them as follows: 

Vertex 0 - Degree 2
Vertex 1 - Degree 4
Vertex 2 - Degree 3
Vertex 3 - Degree 4
Vertex 4 - Degree 1
Vertex 5 - Degree 2
Vertex 6 - Degree 2
Vertex 7 - Degree 4
Vertex 8 - Degree 3
Vertex 9 - Degree 2

Now, we will list the unique triangles found:

<1, 3, 8>
<1, 7, 2>
<1, 5, 9>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 1>
<2, 7, 4>
<2, 8, 3>

Thus, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
