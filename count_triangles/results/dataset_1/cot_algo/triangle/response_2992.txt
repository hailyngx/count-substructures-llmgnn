Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node:
Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 1
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 1
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 5
Node 9: degree 1

Next, we relabel the nodes in ascending order based on their degrees:
Node 1 (degree 1)
Node 2 (degree 1)
Node 3 (degree 1)
Node 6 (degree 1)
Node 7 (degree 1)
Node 9 (degree 1)
Node 0 (degree 2)
Node 4 (degree 2)
Node 5 (degree 2)
Node 8 (degree 5)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we start counting triangles:
1. Edge (1, 0): Node 1 and Node 0 share a connection with Node 4, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
2. Edge (1, 0): No additional triangles.
3. Edge (2, 8): No triangles as Node 2 has fewer connections than Node 8.
4. Edge (3, 5): No triangles as Node 3 has fewer connections than Node 5.
5. Edge (4, 0): No additional triangles.
6. Edge (4, 8): Node 4 shares connections with Node 0 and Node 8, forming a triangle <0, 4, 8>.
7. Edge (5, 3): No additional triangles.
8. Edge (5, 7): No additional triangles.
9. Edge (6, 8): No triangles as Node 6 has fewer connections than Node 8.
10. Edge (7, 5): No additional triangles.
11. Edge (8, 2): No additional triangles.
12. Edge (8, 4): No additional triangles.
13. Edge (8, 6): No additional triangles.
14. Edge (8, 9): No additional triangles.

Therefore, the total number of triangles inside brackets is [2], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4> and <0, 4, 8>.
