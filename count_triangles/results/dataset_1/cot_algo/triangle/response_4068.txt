Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections and relabeling them accordingly, the graph looks as follows: 
(0) - 4 connections
(1) - 2 connections
(3) - 2 connections
(4) - 2 connections
(2) - 3 connections
(9) - 4 connections
(5) - 1 connection
(7) - 2 connections
(6) - 3 connections
(8) - 3 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we consider each edge starting with the vertex with the lower label if it has fewer connections. 

Now, we count the number of triangles to be able to output the total number of triangles. 

The total number of triangles: [10]

Unique triangles found: <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 9>, <3, 7, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, <0, 2, 9>, <8, 6, 4>, <9, 2, 0>.
