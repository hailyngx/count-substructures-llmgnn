Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their degree of connections. The sorted list of vertices according to their degree in ascending order is: 4, 9, 2, 6, 8, 5, 1, 3, 7, 0.

Then, we list each vertex with its respective neighbors:

Vertex 4: 6, 8
Vertex 9: 0, 6
Vertex 2: 7, 8
Vertex 6: 1, 4, 9
Vertex 8: 1, 2, 4
Vertex 5: 0, 1, 7
Vertex 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Vertex 3: 0, 1, 7
Vertex 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5

Now, we count the triangles formed based on the shared connections:

- Triangle <1, 3, 7>
- Triangle <1, 5, 7>

Counting the total number of triangles [2].
