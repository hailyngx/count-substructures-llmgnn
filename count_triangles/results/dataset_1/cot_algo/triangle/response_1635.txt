Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections, the new labels for the vertices are:

0 (degree 4)
1 (degree 5)
2 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 6)
7 (degree 1)
8 (degree 3)
9 (degree 1)

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can analyze each edge to count the triangles. Starting from the edge with the lowest label vertex, we find:

Edge (0, 1):
- Vertex 0 connects with: 2, 7, 8
- Vertex 1 connects with: 3, 4, 5
- Shared connections: none

Edge (0, 2):
- Vertex 0 connects with: 1, 7, 8
- Vertex 2 connects with: 6
- Shared connections: none

Edge (0, 7):
- Vertex 0 connects with: 1, 2, 8
- Vertex 7 connects with: none
- Shared connections: none

Edge (0, 8):
- Vertex 0 connects with: 1, 2, 7
- Vertex 8 connects with: 9
- Shared connections: none

By analyzing all edges, we find a total of 0 triangles. 

Thus, the total number of triangles in the graph is [0].
