Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by their degree:
0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 2)
2 (degree 2)
9 (degree 3)
8 (degree 4)
4 (degree 4)
3 (degree 4)

Now, we will proceed with counting the triangles:
Triangles: [2]

Triangle 1: <4, 5, 9>
Triangle 2: <3, 4, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
