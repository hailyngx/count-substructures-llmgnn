Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, the sorted vertices are: 5, 1, 2, 9, 3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 4.

The unique triangles found in the graph are:

<0, 2, 4>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 7>
<4, 6, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
