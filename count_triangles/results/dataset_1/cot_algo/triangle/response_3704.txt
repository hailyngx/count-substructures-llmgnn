Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertices sorted by degree:
0 (degree 2)
3 (degree 0)
8 (degree 1)
5 (degree 2)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 3)
4 (degree 4)
1 (degree 6)
2 (degree 3)
7 (degree 4)

Relabeled vertices:
0 (1)
3 (2)
8 (3)
5 (4)
6 (5)
9 (6)
4 (7)
1 (8)
2 (9)
7 (10)

Now, let's list the triangles found based on the given edges:
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 6, 8>
<1, 7, 8>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<6, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 2>
<7, 8, 1>
<7, 8, 4>
<7, 8, 6>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
