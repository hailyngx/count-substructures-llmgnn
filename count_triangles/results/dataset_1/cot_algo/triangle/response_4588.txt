Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The Degree-Based ordering method for counting triangles requires us to first sort the vertices based on their degrees. 
The degrees of the vertices are:
- Vertex 0: degree 3
- Vertex 1: degree 3
- Vertex 2: degree 4
- Vertex 3: degree 3
- Vertex 4: degree 2
- Vertex 5: degree 3
- Vertex 7: degree 2
- Vertex 8: degree 2
- Vertex 9: degree 2

The sorted order of vertices according to their degrees is: 4, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 3, 6, 2.

Now, we will go through each edge in this order and count the triangles:
1. Edge (4, 0) - Vertex 4 has connections with vertices 0 and 1. Both 0 and 1 are connected, forming a triangle <0, 1, 4>.
2. Edge (7, 1) - Vertex 7 and 1 are connected, but they do not form a triangle with any other vertex.
3. Edge (8, 2) - Vertex 8 and 2 are connected, but they do not form a triangle with any other vertex.
4. Edge (9, 2) - Vertex 9 and 2 are connected, but they do not form a triangle with any other vertex.
5. Edge (1, 4) - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 4 and 5. Vertex 4 and 5 are also connected, forming a triangle <1, 4, 5>.
6. Edge (5, 8) - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 0, 1, and 8. However, no triangle is formed in this case.
7. Edge (0, 2) - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 2 and 4. Vertex 2 and 4 are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 2, 4>.
8. Edge (3, 7) - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 2, 7, and 9. However, no triangle is formed in this case.
9. Edge (2, 3) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 3, 8, and 9. Vertex 0 and 3 are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 2, 3>.
10. Edge (5, 1) - Vertex 5 has connections with vertices 0, 1, and 8. Vertex 0 and 1 are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.
11. Edge (2, 8) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 3, and 8. However, no triangle is formed in this case.
12. Edge (2, 9) - Vertex 2 has connections with vertices 0, 3, 8, and 9. Vertex 0 and 9 are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 2, 9>.
13. Edge (3, 9) - Vertex 3 has connections with vertices 2, 7, and 9. Vertex 2 and 9 are also connected, forming a triangle <2, 3, 9>.
14. Edge (1, 5) - Vertex 1 has connections with vertices 4, 5, and 7. However, no triangle is formed in this case.
15. Edge (0, 5) - Vertex 0 has connections with vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5. Vertex 1 and 5 are also connected, forming a triangle <0, 1, 5>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [4]. The unique triangles found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <0, 2, 3>, and <0, 2, 9>.
