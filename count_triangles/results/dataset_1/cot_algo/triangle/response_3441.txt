Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree (number of connections), the nodes are relabeled as follows: 6, 0, 5, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 4, 9.

Next, we can count the number of triangles by examining the edges according to the degree-based ordering method:

- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <2, 4, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
