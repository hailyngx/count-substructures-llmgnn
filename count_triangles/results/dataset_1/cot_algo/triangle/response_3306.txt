Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling of the vertices becomes: 
Node 0 - 3 connections 
Node 1 - 3 connection 
Node 5 - 4 connections 
Node 9 - 4 connections 
Node 4 - 4 connections 
Node 2 - 5 connections 
Node 6 - 5 connections 
Node 7 - 5 connections 
Node 8 - 5 connections 
Node 3 - 6 connections 

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we go through each edge:

1. (0, 2): Nodes 0 and 2 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
2. (0, 3): Node 0 has 3 connections and Node 3 has 6 connections, so no triangle is formed.
3. (0, 5): Nodes 0 and 5 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
4. (1, 3): Node 1 has 3 connections and Node 3 has 6 connections, so no triangle is formed.
5. (1, 6): Nodes 1 and 6 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
6. (1, 7): Node 1 has 3 connections and Node 7 has 5 connections, so no triangle is formed.
7. (2, 0): Skipped as Node 0 has fewer connections.
8. (2, 3): Node 2 has 5 connections and Node 3 has 6 connections, so no triangle is formed.
9. (2, 5): Nodes 2 and 5 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
10. (2, 6): Node 2 has 5 connections and Node 6 has 5 connections, so no triangle is formed.
11. (3, 0): Skipped as Node 0 has fewer connections.
12. (3, 1): Skipped as Node 1 has fewer connections.
13. (3, 2): Skipped as Node 2 has fewer connections.
14. (3, 4): Nodes 3 and 4 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
15. (3, 6): Nodes 3 and 6 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 6>.
16. (3, 8): Nodes 3 and 8 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 8>.
17. (4, 3): Skipped as Node 3 has fewer connections.
18. (4, 7): Nodes 4 and 7 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
19. (4, 8): Nodes 4 and 8 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 8>.
20. (4, 9): Nodes 4 and 9 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
21. (5, 0): Skipped as Node 0 has fewer connections.
22. (5, 2): Skipped as Node 2 has fewer connections.
23. (5, 6): Nodes 5 and 6 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
24. (5, 7): Nodes 5 and 7 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
25. (5, 8): Nodes 5 and 8 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
26. (6, 1): Skipped as Node 1 has fewer connections.
27. (6, 2): Skipped as Node 2 has fewer connections.
28. (6, 3): Skipped as Node 3 has fewer connections.
29. (6, 5): Nodes 6 and 5 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
30. (6, 7): Nodes 6 and 7 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
31. (7, 1): Skipped as Node 1 has fewer connections.
32. (7, 4): Skipped as Node 4 has fewer connections.
33. (7, 5): Nodes 7 and 5 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
34. (7, 6): Nodes 7 and 6 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
35. (7, 8): Nodes 7 and 8 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 8>.
36. (8, 3): Skipped as Node 3 has fewer connections.
37. (8, 4): Skipped as Node 4 has fewer connections.
38. (8, 5): Nodes 8 and 5 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 5>.
39. (8, 7): Nodes 8 and 7 have 4 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 8>.
40. (8, 9): Nodes 8 and 9 have 3 shared connections - triangle <0, 2, 8>.
41. (9, 4): Skipped as Node 4 has fewer connections.

The total number of triangles is [10] inside brackets.
