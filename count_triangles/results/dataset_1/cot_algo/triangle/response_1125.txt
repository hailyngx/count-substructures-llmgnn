Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Vertex 1 (degree 2)
Vertex 5 (degree 2)
Vertex 6 (degree 2)
Vertex 0 (degree 3)
Vertex 9 (degree 3)
Vertex 2 (degree 4)
Vertex 8 (degree 4)
Vertex 4 (degree 4)
Vertex 3 (degree 5)
Vertex 7 (degree 7)

Using the degree-based ordering method and considering edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections, we can count the number of triangles and the unique triangles as follows:

Number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
