Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degrees, the new labeling is:
```
Node 0 has degree 2
Node 1 has degree 0
Node 2 has degree 2
Node 3 has degree 3
Node 4 has degree 4
Node 5 has degree 1
Node 6 has degree 4
Node 7 has degree 2
Node 8 has degree 1
Node 9 has degree 4
```

Following the Degree-Based Ordering method and considering only the necessary edges, we count the number of triangles and identify unique triangles:
- Triangle <2, 4, 7>
- Triangle <6, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [2].
