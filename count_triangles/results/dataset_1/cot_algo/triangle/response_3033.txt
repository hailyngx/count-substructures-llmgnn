Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their number of connections in ascending order, the new labeling is as follows: 
Nodes: 
0 (degree 2), 4 (degree 2), 6 (degree 2), 7 (degree 2), 3 (degree 3), 2 (degree 4), 9 (degree 5), 8 (degree 5), 1 (degree 6), 5 (degree 6) 

Considering the edges in the order specified, we will count the triangles:

1. (0, 3): No triangle formed
2. (1, 4): No triangle formed
3. (1, 5): No triangle formed
4. (1, 6): No triangle formed
5. (1, 8): No triangle formed
6. (1, 9): No triangle formed
7. (2, 5): No triangle formed
8. (2, 9): No triangle formed
9. (3, 0): No triangle formed
10. (3, 7): No triangle formed
11. (4, 1): No triangle formed
12. (5, 1): No triangle formed
13. (5, 2): No triangle formed
14. (5, 8): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
15. (5, 9): No triangle formed
16. (6, 1): No triangle formed
17. (7, 3): No triangle formed
18. (7, 8): No triangle formed
19. (8, 1): No triangle formed
20. (8, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 8>
21. (8, 7): No triangle formed
22. (9, 1): No triangle formed
23. (9, 2): No triangle formed
24. (9, 5): Triangle formed: <1, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [3]. The unique triangles found are <1, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 9>.
