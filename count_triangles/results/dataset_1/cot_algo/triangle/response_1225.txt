Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's sort the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 1 connection
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes from 0 to 9 based on their degrees:
Node 5: 0 connections
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 1: 5 connections
Node 2: 6 connections
Node 7: 7 connections
Node 8: 8 connections
Node 6: 9 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will now count the triangles:
- Triangle <2, 6, 8> (shared connection through node 2)
- Triangle <2, 6, 7> (shared connection through node 2)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [2].
