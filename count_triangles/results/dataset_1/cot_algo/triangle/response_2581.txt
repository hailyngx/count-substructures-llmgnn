Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections:

Vertex 0: 1 connection
Vertex 1: 2 connections
Vertex 2: 2 connections
Vertex 3: 1 connection
Vertex 5: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 4 connections
Vertex 7: 2 connections
Vertex 8: 2 connections
Vertex 9: 5 connections

Now, we'll relabel the vertices accordingly:

Vertex 0 --> Label 0
Vertex 3 --> Label 1
Vertex 1 --> Label 2
Vertex 2 --> Label 3
Vertex 5 --> Label 4
Vertex 7 --> Label 5
Vertex 8 --> Label 6
Vertex 6 --> Label 7
Vertex 9 --> Label 8

Following the method, we consider the edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

Edge (0, 9): Vertex 0 < Vertex 8
Edge (1, 5): Vertex 2 < Vertex 4
Edge (2, 6): Vertex 3 < Vertex 7
Edge (3, 9): Vertex 1 < Vertex 8
Edge (5, 1): Vertex 4 > Vertex 2
Edge (5, 6): Vertex 4 < Vertex 7
Edge (5, 7): Vertex 4 < Vertex 5
Edge (5, 8): Vertex 4 < Vertex 6
Edge (6, 2): Vertex 7 > Vertex 3
Edge (6, 7): Vertex 7 > Vertex 5
Edge (6, 9): Vertex 7 < Vertex 8
Edge (7, 5): Vertex 5 > Vertex 4
Edge (7, 6): Vertex 5 < Vertex 7
Edge (8, 5): Vertex 6 > Vertex 4
Edge (8, 9): Vertex 6 < Vertex 8

Counting the triangles, we find:
Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles: <4, 5, 6>, <4, 6, 7>, <4, 7, 5>, <5, 6, 7>
