Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles in the given graph using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to label the nodes based on their degrees in non-decreasing order.

The degrees of each node are as follows:
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 1 connection
Node 4: 5 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 7: 3 connections
Node 8: 4 connections
Node 9: 4 connections

Nodes in order of increasing degrees:
Node 3 < Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7 < Node 9, Node 8 < Node 2 < Node 4

Next, we will go through each edge in the graph and count the triangles formed by shared connections. 

The triangles are formed by the following node combinations:
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 9>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [12].
