Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to sort the vertices by their number of connections:

- Node 4 has 1 connection.
- Nodes 1, 7, and 3 have 2 connections each.
- Nodes 2 and 0 have 4 connections each.
- Nodes 5 and 6 have 5 connections each.
- Node 9 has 7 connections.
- Node 8 has 6 connections.

Now, we will relabel the vertices from least to most connections:

- Node 4 (Degree 1)
- Node 1 (Degree 2)
- Node 7 (Degree 2)
- Node 3 (Degree 2)
- Node 2 (Degree 4)
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 5 (Degree 5)
- Node 6 (Degree 5)
- Node 8 (Degree 6)
- Node 9 (Degree 7)

Next, we will go through the edges and count the number of triangles:

- For the edge (0, 6), Node 0 has 4 connections and Node 6 has 5 connections. As Node 0 has fewer connections, we proceed to check shared connections which are Node 5. So, one triangle <0, 5, 6>.
- For the rest of the edges, no other triangles are formed due to our sorting.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1] with one unique triangle <0, 5, 6>.
