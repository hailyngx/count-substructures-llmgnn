Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their degrees:

Node 0: 2 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 6: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 9: 5 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 2: 6 connections

Based on the sorted order, we relabel the nodes as follows:
Node 0 --> Node 0
Node 1 --> Node 1
Node 4 --> Node 2
Node 6 --> Node 3
Node 7 --> Node 4
Node 5 --> Node 5
Node 9 --> Node 6
Node 3 --> Node 7
Node 8 --> Node 8
Node 2 --> Node 9

Next, we will examine the edges to count the triangles:

1. (0, 2) -> Node 0 and Node 2 have a common connection to Node 9. Triangle: <0, 2, 9>
2. (0, 9) -> Node 0 and Node 9 do not form a triangle with any other node.
3. (1, 4) -> Node 1 and Node 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.
4. (1, 8) -> Node 1 and Node 8 do not form a triangle with any other node.
5. (2, 0) -> Already counted in edge 1.
6. (2, 3) -> Node 2 and Node 7 do not form a triangle with any other node.
7. (2, 4) -> Node 2 and Node 2 do not form a triangle with any other node.
8. (2, 8) -> Node 2 and Node 8 do not form a triangle with any other node.
9. (2, 9) -> Already counted in edge 1.
10. (3, 2) -> Already counted in edge 1.
11. (3, 5) -> Node 7 and Node 5 do not form a triangle with any other node.
12. (3, 7) -> Node 7, Node 5, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle: <7, 5, 8>
13. (3, 8) -> Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle: <7, 8, 9>
14. (4, 1) -> Already counted in edge 3.
15. (4, 2) -> Already counted in edge 7.
16. (4, 8) -> Node 2, Node 4, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle: <2, 4, 8>
17. (5, 3) -> Already counted in edge 11.
18. (5, 6) -> Node 5 and Node 3 do not form a triangle with any other node.
19. (5, 7) -> Already counted in edge 12.
20. (5, 9) -> Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 form a triangle. Triangle: <5, 6, 8>
21. (6, 5) -> Already counted in edge 18.
22. (6, 8) -> Already counted in edge 20.
23. (7, 3) -> Already counted in edge 11.
24. (7, 5) -> Already counted in edge 19.
25. (8, 1) -> Already counted in edge 14.
26. (8, 2) -> Already counted in edge 8.
27. (8, 3) -> Already counted in edge 13.
28. (8, 4) -> Already counted in edge 16.
29. (8, 6) -> Already counted in edge 22.
30. (8, 9) -> Node 8, Node 6, and Node 9 form a triangle. Triangle: <8, 6, 9>
31. (9, 0) -> Already counted in edge 2.
32. (9, 2) -> Already counted in edge 9.
33. (9, 5) -> Already counted in edge 20.
34. (9, 8) -> Already counted in edge 30.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [5], and the unique triangles found are <0, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 8>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 8, 9>, and <2, 4, 8>.
