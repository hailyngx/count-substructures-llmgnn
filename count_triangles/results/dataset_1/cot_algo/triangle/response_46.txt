Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the vertices based on their number of connections:
- Vertex 5: 0 connections
- Vertex 9: 1 connection (with Vertex 8)
- Vertex 0: 2 connections (with Vertices 4 and 8)
- Vertex 6: 2 connections (with Vertices 3 and 7)
- Vertex 1: 3 connections (with Vertices 2, 4, and 8)
- Vertex 5: 3 connections (with Vertices 0, 1, and 8)
- Vertex 2: 4 connections (with Vertices 1, 7, and 8)
- Vertex 7: 4 connections (with Vertices 2, 3, and 8)
- Vertex 3: 4 connections (with Vertices 6, 7, and 8)
- Vertex 8: 6 connections (with Vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 9)

Now, let's count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

- Edge (0, 4): No triangles
- Edge (0, 8): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Edge (1, 2): No triangles
- Edge (1, 4): No triangles
- Edge (1, 8): Forms a triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Edge (2, 1): No triangles
- Edge (2, 7): No triangles
- Edge (2, 8): Forms a triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (3, 6): No triangles
- Edge (3, 7): No triangles
- Edge (3, 8): Forms a triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Edge (4, 0): No triangles
- Edge (4, 1): No triangles
- Edge (6, 3): No triangles
- Edge (7, 2): No triangles
- Edge (7, 3): No triangles
- Edge (8, 0): Forms a triangle <0, 4, 8>
- Edge (8, 1): Forms a triangle <1, 4, 8>
- Edge (8, 2): Forms a triangle <1, 2, 8>
- Edge (8, 3): Forms a triangle <3, 7, 8>
- Edge (8, 9): No triangles

Total number of triangles: [4]
Unique triangles found: <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <3, 7, 8>
