Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by their degree in increasing order, the node numbering will be as follows: 

Node 7: Degree 1<br>
Node 8: Degree 1<br>
Node 4: Degree 2<br>
Node 3: Degree 2<br>
Node 9: Degree 2<br>
Node 0: Degree 2<br>
Node 6: Degree 3<br>
Node 1: Degree 3<br>
Node 5: Degree 4<br>
Node 2: Degree 4

Now, we will count the triangles in the given graph:

- Triangle <1, 2, 5>
- Triangle <1, 3, 6>
- Triangle <1, 6, 5>
- Triangle <2, 5, 9>
- Triangle <2, 5, 6>
- Triangle <2, 5, 4>
- Triangle <3, 1, 6>
- Triangle <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle <5, 6, 1>
- Triangle <5, 9, 0>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
