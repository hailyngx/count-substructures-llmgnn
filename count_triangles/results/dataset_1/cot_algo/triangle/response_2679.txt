Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has:

Node 3: 1 connection
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 7: 2 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 9: 4 connections
Node 5: 4 connections
Node 4: 4 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 0: 7 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes accordingly:

Node 3 (1 connection) -> Node 0
Node 1 (2 connections) -> Node 1
Node 7 (2 connections) -> Node 2
Node 8 (3 connections) -> Node 3
Node 9 (4 connections) -> Node 4
Node 5 (4 connections) -> Node 5
Node 4 (4 connections) -> Node 6
Node 6 (4 connections) -> Node 7
Node 2 (4 connections) -> Node 8
Node 0 (7 connections) -> Node 9

Now, let's go through each edge, considering only cases where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (1, 5): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (1, 6): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (2, 4): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (2, 6): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (3, 7): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (4, 0): Forms triangle with Node 2 -> Triangle <0, 2, 4>
- Edge (5, 0): Forms triangle with Node 1 -> Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 1): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 1, 5>
- Edge (5, 8): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (5, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (6, 0): Forms triangle with Node 1 -> Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Edge (6, 1): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 1, 6>
- Edge (6, 2): Forms triangle with Node 0 -> Triangle <0, 2, 6>
- Edge (7, 0): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 2): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 5): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (8, 9): Does not form a triangle
- Edge (9, 0): Forms triangle with Node 4 -> Triangle <0, 4, 9>
- Edge (9, 5): Forms triangle with Node 4 -> Triangle <0, 5, 9>
- Edge (9, 8): Does not form a triangle

Finally, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 2, 4>, and <0, 4, 9>.
