Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, we will now apply the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the number of triangles.

First, we sort the vertices based on their number of connections:
Vertices: 
0 - 2 connections
1 - 2 connections
6 - 2 connections
9 - 2 connections
7 - 3 connections
5 - 3 connections
2 - 4 connections
4 - 4 connections
3 - 5 connections
So, the sorted order of vertices is: 0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 5, 2, 4, 3

Next, we will go through each edge and count the triangles formed:
1. Edge (0, 7): 
    - No triangles formed.

2. Edge (1, 4): 
    - No triangles formed.

3. Edge (2, 3): 
    - No triangles formed.

4. Edge (2, 6): 
    - No triangles formed.

5. Edge (3, 2): 
    - No triangles formed.

6. Edge (3, 4): 
    - 1 triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>

7. Edge (3, 5): 
    - 1 triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>

8. Edge (4, 1): 
    - No triangles formed.

9. Edge (4, 3): 
    - 1 triangle formed: <2, 3, 4>

10. Edge (4, 9): 
    - No triangles formed.

11. Edge (5, 3): 
    - 1 triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>

12. Edge (5, 7): 
    - No triangles formed.

13. Edge (6, 2): 
    - No triangles formed.

14. Edge (7, 0): 
    - No triangles formed.

15. Edge (7, 5): 
    - 1 triangle formed: <3, 5, 7>

16. Edge (9, 4): 
    - No triangles formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3].
Unique triangles found: <2, 3, 4>, <3, 5, 7>.
