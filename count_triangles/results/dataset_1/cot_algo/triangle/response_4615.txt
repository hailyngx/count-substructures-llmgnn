Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0: 4 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 3 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 3 connections
8: 3 connections
2: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
7: 2 connections
9: 1 connection

Now, let's relabel the vertices accordingly:

0 -> 0
1 -> 1
3 -> 2
5 -> 3
6 -> 4
8 -> 5
2 -> 6
4 -> 7
7 -> 8
9 -> 9

Next, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method. We will only consider edges where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

<0, 7, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 5, 8>

[Total number of triangles: 3]
