Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices is as follows:
Node 0: 1 connection
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 4: 1 connection
Node 2: 2 connections
Node 8: 2 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 1: 4 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 5: 6 connections

Following the degree-based ordering, we proceed with the edges with the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections:

1. Edge (0, 5) is skipped.
2. Edge (1, 4) is skipped.
3. Edge (1, 5) forms triangle <1, 5, 0>.
4. Edge (1, 8) is skipped.
5. Edge (1, 9) forms triangle <1, 9, 5>.
6. Edge (2, 5) forms triangle <2, 5, 1>.
7. Edge (2, 8) is skipped.
8. Edge (3, 6) forms triangle <3, 6, 7>.
9. Edge (3, 7) is skipped.
10. Edge (4, 1) is skipped.
11. Edge (5, 0) is skipped.
12. Edge (5, 1) is skipped.
13. Edge (5, 2) is skipped.
14. Edge (5, 7) forms triangle <5, 7, 1>.
15. Edge (5, 9) forms triangle <5, 9, 1>.
16. Edge (6, 3) is skipped.
17. Edge (6, 7) is skipped.
18. Edge (7, 3) is skipped.
19. Edge (7, 5) forms triangle <7, 5, 1>.
20. Edge (8, 1) is skipped.
21. Edge (8, 2) is skipped.
22. Edge (9, 1) is skipped.
23. Edge (9, 5) forms triangle <9, 5, 1>.
24. Edge (9, 6) is skipped.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [6] as listed inside brackets.
