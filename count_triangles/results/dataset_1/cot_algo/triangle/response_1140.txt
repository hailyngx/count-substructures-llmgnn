Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes by degree in ascending order, the new labels for the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 2: Degree 5
Node 7: Degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges where the lower labeled node has fewer connections:
- Edge (0, 7) forms the triangle <0, 7, 1>.
- Edge (1, 6) forms the triangle <1, 6, 4>.
- Edge (2, 3) does not form a triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 4) does not form a triangle as both nodes have the same degree.
- Edge (2, 8) forms the triangle <2, 8, 4>.
- Edge (3, 8) forms the triangle <3, 8, 4>.
- Edge (3, 9) forms the triangle <3, 9, 6>.
- Edge (4, 6) forms the triangle <4, 6, 1>.
- Edge (5, 8) does not form a triangle as node 5 has the lowest degree.
- Edge (6, 9) forms the triangle <6, 9, 3>.
- Edge (7, 0) forms the triangle <7, 0, 1>.
- Edge (7, 1) forms the triangle <7, 1, 6>.
- Edge (7, 2) forms the triangle <7, 2, 8>.
- Edge (8, 5) does not form a triangle as node 5 has the lowest degree.
- Edge (9, 6) forms the triangle <9, 6, 1>.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [9], and the unique triangles found are <0, 7, 1>, <1, 6, 4>, <2, 8, 4>, <3, 8, 4>, <3, 9, 6>, <4, 6, 1>, <6, 9, 3>, <7, 0, 1>, and <7, 2, 8>.
