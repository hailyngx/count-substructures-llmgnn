Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Vertices sorted by their number of connections:
1. Node 2 - Degree: 0
2. Node 4 - Degree: 0
3. Node 8 - Degree: 2
4. Node 3 - Degree: 2
5. Node 1 - Degree: 2
6. Node 9 - Degree: 2
7. Node 5 - Degree: 3
8. Node 7 - Degree: 3
9. Node 0 - Degree: 4
10. Node 6 - Degree: 4

Triangles found: 
[6] 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1]. 
Unique triangles found: <6, 0, 5>.
