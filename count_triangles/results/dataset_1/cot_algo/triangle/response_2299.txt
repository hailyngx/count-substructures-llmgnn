Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections (degree), the new labels for the vertices will be:
- Node 0: 1 connection
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 7: 1 connection
- Node 3: 2 connections
- Node 5: 2 connections
- Node 2: 3 connections
- Node 6: 4 connections
- Node 1: 5 connections
- Node 8: 5 connections
- Node 9: 5 connections

Based on the degree-based ordering, we can now count the number of triangles:

1. Looking at edge (0, 1): Node 0 (1) has a connection to Node 1 (5). Checking for shared connections of Node 0 and Node 1, we find that they share a connection with Node 2. So, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 2>.

2. Looking at edge (0, 2): Node 0 (1) has a connection to Node 2 (3). Checking for shared connections of Node 0 and Node 2, we find that they share a connection with Node 1. So, the triangle formed is <0, 1, 2>.

3. Looking at edge (1, 3): Node 1 (5) has a connection to Node 3 (2). Checking for shared connections of Node 1 and Node 3, we find that they share a connection with Node 2. So, the triangle formed is <1, 2, 3>.

4. Looking at edge (1, 5): Node 1 (5) has a connection to Node 5 (2). Checking for shared connections of Node 1 and Node 5, we find that they share a connection with Node 9. So, the triangle formed is <1, 5, 9>.

5. Looking at edge (1, 6): Node 1 (5) has a connection to Node 6 (4). Checking for shared connections of Node 1 and Node 6, we find that they share a connection with Node 8. So, the triangle formed is <1, 6, 8>.

6. Looking at edge (2, 3): Node 2 (3) has a connection to Node 3 (2). Checking for shared connections of Node 2 and Node 3, we find that they share a connection with Node 1. So, the triangle formed is <1, 2, 3>.

7. Looking at edge (2, 4): Node 2 (3) has a connection to Node 4 (1). Checking for shared connections of Node 2 and Node 4, we find that they share a connection with Node 0. So, the triangle formed is <0, 2, 4>.

8. Looking at edge (5, 9): Node 5 (2) has a connection to Node 9 (5). Checking for shared connections of Node 5 and Node 9, we find that they share a connection with Node 1. So, the triangle formed is <1, 5, 9>.

The total number of triangles is [8].
