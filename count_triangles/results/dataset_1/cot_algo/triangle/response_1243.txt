Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
After sorting the nodes based on their degree, the new node order is: 9, 5, 7, 8, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method to count the triangles, we find the following triangles: 
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
