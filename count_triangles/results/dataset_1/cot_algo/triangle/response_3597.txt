Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on their degree:
Vertices: 3, 4, 8, 7, 2, 1, 8, 0, 5, 6

Now, checking the edges by starting from the vertex with the lower label:
Edges (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6)

Number of triangles: [4]

Unique triangles:
<3, 4, 5>, <3, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 6>, <3, 6, 7>
