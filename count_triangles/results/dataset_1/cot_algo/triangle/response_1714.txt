Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first need to sort the vertices by their number of connections in ascending order and then relabel the vertices accordingly. 

The sorted list of vertices based on their connections is:  
1 (with 2 connections), 7 (with 2 connections), 6 (with 3 connections), 1 (with 3 connections), 4 (with 3 connections), 9 (with 4 connections), 5 (with 4 connections), 2 (with 5 connections).

Now, we will check each edge starting with the one involving the vertex with the lower label, to prevent counting triangles multiple times. We will count the triangles formed by shared connections.

The triangles found are:
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in this graph is [5].
