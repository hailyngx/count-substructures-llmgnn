Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The degree-based ordering of the vertices based on the number of connections is as follows:
Node 3, 6: degree 2
Node 1, 5, 8: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 0, 7: degree 5
Node 2: degree 6

Analyzing the edges using the degree-based ordering method, we can find the triangles and count them:
1. Edge (0, 3) does not form a triangle.
2. Edge (0, 4) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 4, 7>.
3. Edge (0, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8: <0, 7, 8>.
4. Edge (0, 8) forms a triangle with node 7: <0, 8, 7>.
5. Edge (1, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <1, 2, 5>.
6. Edge (1, 5) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7: <1, 5, 7>.
7. Edge (1, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <1, 7, 4>. It was already counted in triangle 2.
8. Edge (2, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 5 and 7: <2, 1, 5>. It was already counted in triangle 5.
9. Edge (2, 5) does not form a triangle.
10. Edge (2, 6) does not form a triangle.
11. Edge (2, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <2, 7, 5>. It was already counted in triangle 1.
12. Edge (2, 8) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <2, 8, 4>. It was already counted in triangle 3.
13. Edge (3, 0) does not form a triangle.
14. Edge (4, 0) forms a triangle with node 7: <4, 0, 7>. It was already counted in triangle 2.
15. Edge (4, 7) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <4, 7, 8>. It was already counted in triangle 3.
16. Edge (4, 8) does not form a triangle.
17. Edge (5, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 7: <5, 1, 7>. It was already counted in triangle 5.
18. Edge (5, 2) does not form a triangle.
19. Edge (6, 2) does not form a triangle.
20. Edge (6, 7) does not form a triangle.
21. Edge (7, 0) forms a triangle with nodes 4 and 8: <7, 0, 8>. It was already counted in triangle 3.
22. Edge (7, 1) forms a triangle with nodes 2 and 5: <7, 1, 5>. It was already counted in triangle 5.
23. Edge (7, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 1 and 5: <7, 2, 5>. It was already counted in triangle 1.
24. Edge (7, 4) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 8: <7, 4, 8>. It was already counted in triangle 3.
25. Edge (7, 6) does not form a triangle.
26. Edge (8, 0) forms a triangle with node 7: <8, 0, 7>. It was already counted in triangle 2.
27. Edge (8, 2) forms a triangle with nodes 0 and 4: <8, 2, 4>. It was already counted in triangle 3.
28. Edge (8, 4) does not form a triangle.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [3], and the unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 7, 8>, and <1, 2, 5>.
