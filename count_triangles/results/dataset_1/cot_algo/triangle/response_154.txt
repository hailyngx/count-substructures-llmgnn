Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The vertices sorted by their number of connections are as follows:
Vertex 5: 0 connections
Vertex 7: 0 connections
Vertex 9: 1 connection
Vertex 4: 3 connections
Vertex 3: 3 connections
Vertex 8: 4 connections
Vertex 6: 5 connections
Vertex 2: 5 connections
Vertex 1: 5 connections
Vertex 0: 5 connections

By examining the edges according to the Degree-Based Ordering method, we find the following triangles:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 7, 8>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [7].
