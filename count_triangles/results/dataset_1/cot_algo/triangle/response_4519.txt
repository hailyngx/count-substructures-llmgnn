Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on their number of connections. Here is the sorted list of vertices:

0: 3 connections
1: 3 connections
3: 1 connection
4: 2 connections
5: 2 connections
6: 2 connections
8: 1 connection
9: 3 connections
7: 4 connections
2: 5 connections

Now, let's count the number of triangles by considering each edge:

(0, 2): 0 and 2 share a connection with 9, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
(0, 5): No triangles.
(0, 9): No triangles.
(1, 2): 1 and 2 share a connection with 7, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(1, 7): 1 and 7 share a connection with 2, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(1, 8): No triangles.
(2, 0): 2 and 0 share a connection with 9, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
(2, 1): 2 and 1 share a connection with 7, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(2, 3): No triangles.
(2, 7): 2 and 7 share a connection with 1, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(2, 9): 2 and 9 share a connection with 0, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
(3, 2): No triangles.
(4, 6): No triangles.
(4, 7): No triangles.
(5, 0): No triangles.
(5, 6): No triangles.
(6, 4): No triangles.
(6, 5): No triangles.
(7, 1): 7 and 1 share a connection with 2, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(7, 2): 7 and 2 share a connection with 1, forming the triangle <1, 2, 7>.
(7, 4): No triangles.
(7, 9): 7 and 9 share a connection with 2, forming the triangle <2, 7, 9>.
(8, 1): No triangles.
(9, 0): No triangles.
(9, 2): 9 and 2 share a connection with 0, forming the triangle <0, 2, 9>.
(9, 7): 9 and 7 share a connection with 2, forming the triangle <2, 7, 9>.

Thus, the total number of triangles is [4] inside brackets.
