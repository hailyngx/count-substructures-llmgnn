Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections from least to most, then relabeling them accordingly:

Node 0: 3 connections
Node 1: 2 connections
Node 4: 2 connections
Node 3: 2 connections
Node 5: 3 connections
Node 9: 2 connections
Node 7: 4 connections
Node 8: 3 connections
Node 6: 4 connections
Node 2: 5 connections

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we will start examining the edges:

1. Edge (0, 6): Shared connections with node 6: 1, 2. Triangle found: <0, 6, 2>
2. Edge (0, 8): Shared connections with node 8: None.
3. Edge (1, 6): Shared connections with node 6: 0, 2. Triangle found: <1, 6, 0>
4. Edge (1, 9): Shared connections with node 9: None.
5. Edge (2, 3): Shared connections with node 3: 7. Triangle found: <2, 3, 7>
6. Edge (2, 4): Shared connections with node 4: None.
7. Edge (2, 6): Shared connections with node 6: 0, 1. Triangle found: <2, 6, 0>
8. Edge (2, 7): Shared connections with node 7: 3, 5. Triangle found: <2, 7, 3>
9. Edge (2, 8): Shared connections with node 8: None.
10. Edge (3, 2): Shared connections with node 2: 7. Triangle found: <3, 2, 7>
11. Edge (3, 7): Shared connections with node 7: 2, 5. Triangle found: <3, 7, 2>
12. Edge (4, 2): Shared connections with node 2: None.
13. Edge (4, 5): Shared connections with node 5: 7. Triangle found: <4, 5, 7>
14. Edge (5, 7): Shared connections with node 7: 2, 3, 4. Triangles found: <5, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 3>, <5, 7, 4>
15. Edge (5, 8): Shared connections with node 8: None.
16. Edge (6, 0): Shared connections with node 0: 2. Triangle found: <6, 0, 2>
17. Edge (6, 1): Shared connections with node 1: 2. Triangle found: <6, 1, 2>
18. Edge (6, 2): Shared connections with node 2: 0, 1. Triangle found: <6, 2, 0>
19. Edge (7, 2): Shared connections with node 2: 3. Triangle found: <7, 2, 3>
20. Edge (7, 3): Shared connections with node 3: 2, 5. Triangle found: <7, 3, 2>
21. Edge (7, 5): Shared connections with node 5: 4. Triangle found: <7, 5, 4>
22. Edge (7, 9): Shared connections with node 9: None.
23. Edge (8, 0): Shared connections with node 0: None.
24. Edge (8, 2): Shared connections with node 2: None.
25. Edge (8, 5): Shared connections with node 5: 7. Triangle found: <8, 5, 7>
26. Edge (9, 1): Shared connections with node 1: None.
27. Edge (9, 7): Shared connections with node 7: None.

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [15].
