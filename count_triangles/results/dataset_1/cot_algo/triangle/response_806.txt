Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of connections each vertex has:
- Node 0: 2 connections
- Node 1: 4 connections
- Node 2: 2 connections
- Node 3: 4 connections
- Node 4: 1 connection
- Node 5: 4 connections
- Node 6: 3 connections
- Node 7: 4 connections
- Node 8: 2 connections
- Node 9: 2 connections

By sorting the nodes by their degrees in ascending order, we get the following order:
0 < 2 < 8 < 9 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 5 < 7 < 1

Now, we will count the triangles:
1. (0, 4): No triangles
2. (0, 7): No triangles
3. (1, 3): Triangle formed with node 5: <1, 3, 5>
4. (1, 5): No triangles
5. (1, 6): No triangles
6. (1, 7): No triangles
7. (2, 5): No triangles
8. (2, 9): No triangles
9. (3, 1): Triangle formed with node 5: <1, 3, 5>
10. (3, 5): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 3, 5>
11. (3, 7): No triangles
12. (3, 8): No triangles
13. (4, 0): No triangles
14. (5, 1): Triangle formed with node 3: <1, 3, 5>
15. (5, 2): No triangles
16. (5, 3): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 3, 5>
17. (5, 6): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 5, 6>
18. (6, 1): Triangle formed with node 5: <1, 5, 6>
19. (6, 5): Triangle formed with node 1: <1, 5, 6>
20. (6, 9): No triangles
21. (7, 0): No triangles
22. (7, 1): No triangles
23. (7, 3): No triangles
24. (7, 8): No triangles
25. (8, 3): No triangles
26. (8, 7): No triangles
27. (9, 2): No triangles
28. (9, 6): No triangles

Count of triangles: [3]
Unique triangles found: <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 6>
