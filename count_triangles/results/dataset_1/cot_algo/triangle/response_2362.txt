Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Now we'll relabel the vertices: 
- Node 8: 0
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 2
- Node 7: 3
- Node 0: 4
- Node 6: 5
- Node 5: 6
- Node 9: 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 9

Next, we'll list the unique triangles:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>

Finally, we count the total number of triangles: 
There are 9 triangles in total, which can be represented as [9].
