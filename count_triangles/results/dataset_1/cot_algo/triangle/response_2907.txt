Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their degree from least to most connections, we get the following new labels for the vertices: 

Vertices: 
0 (degree 3) -> new label 2
1 (degree 3) -> new label 3
7 (degree 1) -> new label 4
4 (degree 2) -> new label 5
6 (degree 3) -> new label 6
9 (degree 2) -> new label 7
3 (degree 3) -> new label 8
8 (degree 4) -> new label 9
5 (degree 5) -> new label 10
2 (degree 6) -> new label 11

Analyzing the given edges following the degree-based ordering, we find the triangles formed by shared connections:

Triangles: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<3, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [10].
