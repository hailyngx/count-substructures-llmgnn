Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by their degrees, we get the following order: 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 0, 7.

The edges that satisfy the condition of the lower labeled vertex having fewer connections are: (1, 7), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (0, 3), (3, 7), (3, 9), (9, 5).

Now, let's check for shared connections to count the triangles:
- Triangle 1: <0, 1, 7>
- Triangle 2: <0, 2, 5>
- Triangle 3: <0, 3, 6>
- Triangle 4: <3, 4, 0>
- Triangle 5: <3, 6, 0>
- Triangle 6: <3, 7, 0>
- Triangle 7: <3, 9, 0>
- Triangle 8: <3, 9, 5>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the given graph is [8].
