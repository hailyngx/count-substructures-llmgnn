Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method will be applied to count the number of triangles in the given graph. 

Sorting the vertices by number of connections yields the following labels:
Node 1 (degree 2): 1
Node 0 (degree 3): 2
Node 5 (degree 2): 3
Node 6 (degree 2): 4
Node 8 (degree 1): 5
Node 2 (degree 3): 6
Node 7 (degree 4): 7
Node 9 (degree 5): 8
Node 3 (degree 4): 9
Node 4 (degree 5): 10

Counting triangles:
(0, 4, 7)
(0, 4, 9)
(0, 7, 2)
(4, 7, 2)
(4, 7, 9)
(4, 9, 6)
(2, 7, 0)
(2, 7, 4)
(7, 9, 4)
(7, 9, 6)
(9, 4, 0)
(9, 4, 3)
(9, 6, 3)

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [13]. 
The unique triangles found are <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <0, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 9, 6>, <2, 7, 0>, <2, 7, 4>, <7, 9, 4>, <7, 9, 6>, <9, 4, 0>, <9, 4, 3>, <9, 6, 3>.
