Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is the node with the least connections.
Node 2 and Node 7 are next with 1 connection each.

Considering the edges, we can see that the only edge where the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections is (2, 3). This edge forms one triangle with Node 2, Node 3, and one of their shared connections. 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [1].
The unique triangle found in the graph is <2, 3, 9>.
