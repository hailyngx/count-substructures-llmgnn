Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices based on the number of connections each vertex has. The sorted list of vertices is as follows: 

Vertices: 
3 - connections: 2
4 - connections: 2
7 - connections: 1
9 - connections: 1
2 - connections: 2
8 - connections: 2
0 - connections: 4
5 - connections: 5
6 - connections: 4

Based on these sorted vertices, we will examine each edge to count the number of triangles.

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 3):
Shared connections with 0: 5
Shared connections with 3: None
Triangles: <0, 5, 3>

For edge (0, 5):
Shared connections with 0: 3, 4, 6
Shared connections with 5: 4, 6, 7, 9
Triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <0, 6, 5>

For edge (0, 6):
Shared connections with 0: 3, 5
Shared connections with 6: 2, 4, 8
Triangles: <0, 3, 6>, <0, 4, 6>

For edge (2, 6):
Shared connections with 2: None
Shared connections with 6: 0, 4, 8
Triangles: None

For edge (3, 8):
Shared connections with 3: 0
Shared connections with 8: 6
Triangles: <0, 3, 8>

For edge (4, 5):
Shared connections with 4: 0, 6
Shared connections with 5: 0, 6, 7, 9
Triangles: <0, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 5>

For edge (4, 6):
Shared connections with 4: 0, 5
Shared connections with 6: 0, 2, 8
Triangles: <0, 4, 6>, <4, 5, 6>

For edge (5, 7):
Shared connections with 5: 0, 9
Shared connections with 7: None
Triangles: None

For edge (5, 9):
Shared connections with 5: 0, 7
Shared connections with 9: None
Triangles: None

For edge (6, 8):
Shared connections with 6: 0, 4
Shared connections with 8: 3
Triangles: <0, 6, 8>

Total number of triangles: [9]
