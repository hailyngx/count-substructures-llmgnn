Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degree:
Node 7: 1 connection
Node 5: 2 connections
Node 1: 3 connections
Node 4: 3 connections
Node 6: 3 connections
Node 9: 3 connections
Node 2: 4 connections
Node 3: 5 connections
Node 8: 6 connections
Node 0: 8 connections

Now, we will relabel the nodes based on their degrees:
Node 7 (1 connection) becomes Node 0
Node 5 (2 connections) becomes Node 1
Node 1 (3 connections) becomes Node 2
Node 4 (3 connections) becomes Node 3
Node 6 (3 connections) becomes Node 4
Node 9 (3 connections) becomes Node 5
Node 2 (4 connections) becomes Node 6
Node 3 (5 connections) becomes Node 7
Node 8 (6 connections) becomes Node 8
Node 0 (8 connections) becomes Node 9

Now, let's list the edges that meet the criteria of the method (lower label has fewer connections):
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (6, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the triangles formed by these edges:
- Triangle 1: <0, 2, 4>
- Triangle 2: <0, 3, 8>
- Triangle 3: <1, 2, 4>
- Triangle 4: <2, 4, 6>
- Triangle 5: <4, 6, 9>
- Triangle 6: <5, 7, 1>
- Triangle 7: <5, 9, 8>

The total number of triangles is [7].
