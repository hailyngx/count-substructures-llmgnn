Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's sort the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 1: 1 connection  
Node 3: 2 connections  
Node 9: 2 connections  
Node 2: 2 connections  
Node 6: 0 connections  
Node 0: 5 connections  
Node 5: 5 connections  
Node 7: 5 connections  
Node 4: 5 connections  
Node 8: 5 connections  

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degrees:

Node 1 (1) → Node 0  
Node 3 (2) → Node 1  
Node 9 (2) → Node 2  
Node 2 (2) → Node 3  
Node 6 (0) → Node 4  
Node 0 (5) → Node 5  
Node 5 (5) → Node 6  
Node 7 (5) → Node 7  
Node 4 (5) → Node 8  
Node 8 (5) → Node 9  

Now, we will count the triangles based on the newly labeled vertices:

[Total number of triangles: 6]

<0, 5, 7>  
<0, 5, 8>  
<0, 7, 8>  
<5, 7, 8>  
<4, 5, 7>  
<4, 5, 8>
