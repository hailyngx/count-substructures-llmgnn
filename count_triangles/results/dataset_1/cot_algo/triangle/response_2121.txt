Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting vertices by their number of connections from least to most. 

The sorted vertices are: 3, 9, 0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 8

Now, we will count the triangles in the graph:
- Vertex 3 (degree 0) forms 0 triangles.
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) forms 0 triangles.
- Vertex 0 (degree 3) forms 2 triangles: <0, 2, 4> and <0, 4, 8>.
- Vertex 1 (degree 2) forms 0 triangles.
- Vertex 5 (degree 2) forms 1 triangle: <5, 2, 7>.
- Vertex 6 (degree 3) forms 1 triangle: <6, 1, 7>.
- Vertex 9 (degree 1) forms 0 triangles.
- Vertex 4 (degree 4) forms 3 triangles: <4, 0, 2>, <4, 0, 8>, and <4, 2, 8>.
- Vertex 7 (degree 4) forms 3 triangles: <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 5>, and <7, 5, 6>.
- Vertex 8 (degree 4) forms 4 triangles: <8, 0, 2>, <8, 0, 4>, <8, 2, 4>, and <8, 4, 6>.

Total number of triangles: [14]
