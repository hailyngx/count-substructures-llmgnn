Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph, sort the vertices by their number of connections:

0 -> 2 connections
4 -> 1 connection
9 -> 1 connection
5 -> 2 connections
7 -> 2 connections
1 -> 3 connections
8 -> 4 connections
3 -> 5 connections

Now we start counting triangles: 

- (0, 3) -> 0 and 3 share a connection at 8, forming a triangle <0, 3, 8>.
- (0, 8) -> 0 and 8 share a connection at 3, forming a triangle <0, 8, 3>.
- (1, 3) -> 1 and 3 share a connection at 5, forming a triangle <1, 3, 5>.
- (1, 5) -> 1 and 5 share a connection at 7, forming a triangle <1, 5, 7>.
- (1, 7) -> 1 and 7 share a connection at 5, forming a triangle <1, 7, 5>.
- (3, 8) -> 3 and 8 share a connection at 0, forming a triangle <3, 8, 0>.
- (3, 9) -> 3 and 9 do not share any connections.
- (5, 7) -> 5 and 7 share a connection at 1, forming a triangle <5, 7, 1>.
- (8, 4) -> 8 and 4 do not share any connections.
- (9, 3) -> 9 and 3 do not share any connections.

The total number of triangles in the graph is [8].
