Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Nodes sorted by degree:
1. 8 (degree 2)
2. 1, 9 (degree 1)
3. 3, 6 (degree 3)
4. 2, 7 (degree 4)
5. 0, 5 (degree 5)
6. 4 (degree 6)

Therefore, the triangles are:
[8, 1, 0], [0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 7], [0, 4, 5], [0, 4, 6], [0, 4, 7], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 7], [2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 7], [0, 4, 5], [4, 5, 2], [5, 9, 0], [5, 9, 2]
Total number of triangles: [16]
