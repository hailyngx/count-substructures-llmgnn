Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method, we first sort the vertices based on their degrees:

0 - degree: 1
1 - degree: 1
4 - degree: 1
6 - degree: 1
7 - degree: 4
5 - degree: 4
9 - degree: 4
8 - degree: 5
3 - degree: 5
2 - degree: 6

Now, we relabel the vertices:
0 → 0
1 → 1
4 → 2
6 → 3
7 → 4
5 → 5
9 → 6
8 → 7
3 → 8
2 → 9

Using the relabeled vertices, we have the following edges:
(0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7)

By checking the shared connections, we find the triangles: <3, 4, 7>, <3, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 8>. 

So, the total number of triangles in the graph is [6].
