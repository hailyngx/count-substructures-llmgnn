Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices by the number of connections, the new labels are: 
Node 7 has 0 connections.
Nodes 1, 3, and 4 have 1 connection each.
Nodes 6 and 5 have 2 connections each.
Nodes 0, 9, and 8 have 4 connections each.
Node 2 has 5 connections.

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we proceed with the edges as follows:
Edge (2, 1) is skipped since both vertices have the same number of connections.
Edge (5, 2) forms a triangle: <2, 5, 0>.
Edge (4, 6) does not form a triangle.
Edge (8, 0) forms a triangle: <0, 8, 5>.
Edge (8, 5) forms a triangle: <5, 8, 0>.
Edge (8, 9) forms a triangle: <8, 9, 0>.

Total number of triangles: [4]
