Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
After sorting the vertices based on their number of connections in ascending order, the new labels for the vertices are:  
Node 1 (1 connection): 9  
Node 6 (2 connections): 2  
Node 8 (2 connections): 7  
Node 4 (3 connections): 0  
Node 2 (4 connections): 1  
Node 7 (4 connections): 3  
Node 3 (5 connections): 4  
Node 5 (6 connections): 5  
Node 10 (6 connections): 8  
Node 9 (7 connections): 6

With the new labels, the edges can be rewritten as follows:  
(6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (8, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 2)  

Now, we will count the triangles formed by examining shared connections between vertices:
- Triangle 1: <0, 4, 6>
- Triangle 2: <0, 4, 7>
- Triangle 3: <0, 5, 6>
- Triangle 4: <0, 5, 7>
- Triangle 5: <4, 5, 6>
- Triangle 6: <4, 5, 7>
- Triangle 7: <5, 6, 7>

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [7].
