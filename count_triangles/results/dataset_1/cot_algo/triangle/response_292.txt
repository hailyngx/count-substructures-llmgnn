Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method involves sorting the vertices by their number of connections:

Node 1: 1 connection (1)
Node 3: 2 connections (2, 5)
Node 6: 2 connections (6, 7)
Node 2: 2 connections (8, 3)
Node 0: 4 connections (9, 4, 7, 1)

Relabeling the nodes accordingly:
1 → 0 , 3 → 1, 6 → 2, 2 → 3, 0 → 4

Now, looking at the edges and only proceeding when the vertex with the lower label has fewer connections:

- Edge (0, 1): Node 0 has connections to 4, 7, so check nodes 4 and 7 for shared connections.
- Edge (0, 4): Node 0 has connections to 7, 9, so check nodes 7 and 9 for shared connections.
- Edge (0, 7): Node 0 has connections to 4, 9, so check nodes 4 and 9 for shared connections.
- Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has connections to 4, 7, so check nodes 4 and 7 for shared connections.
- Edge (1, 3): Node 1 has connections to 5 only, no shared connections.
- Edge (2, 4): Node 2 has connections to 8, no shared connections.
- Edge (2, 8): Node 2 has connections to 4, 6, check nodes 4 and 6 for shared connections.
- Edge (3, 4): Node 3 has connections to 5, check node 1 for shared connection.
- Edge (3, 5): Node 3 has connections to 4, check nodes 1 and 3 for shared connections.
- Edge (4, 6): Node 4 has connections to 7, check node 6 for shared connection and so on...

Following this process, the identified unique triangles are: 
<0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <1, 3, 5> 

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4].
