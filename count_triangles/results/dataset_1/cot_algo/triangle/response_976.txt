Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The sorted list of vertices based on their degrees is: 

0 (degree 2)
1 (degree 2)
3 (degree 2)
4 (degree 2)
5 (degree 2)
7 (degree 2)
8 (degree 2)
6 (degree 3)
9 (degree 6)
2 (degree 7)

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, the triangles in the given graph are:
