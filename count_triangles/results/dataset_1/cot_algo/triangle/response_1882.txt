Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the Degree-Based Ordering method:
Node 0 has 2 connections.
Node 1 has 2 connections.
Node 3 has 2 connections.
Node 5 has 1 connection.
Node 7 has 2 connections.
Node 4 has 2 connections.
Node 6 has 2 connections.
Node 8 has 3 connections.
Node 2 has 3 connections.
Node 9 has 5 connections.

Based on the number of connections, the ordering of the nodes is: 5, 0, 1, 3, 6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 9.

Now, we will go through the edges and count the triangles:
1. Edge (0, 2): Node 0 and Node 2 share a connection with Node 8 forming a triangle <0, 2, 8>.
2. Edge (0, 8): No triangle formed.
3. Edge (1, 6): No triangle formed.
4. Edge (1, 7): No triangle formed.
5. Edge (2, 8): No triangle formed.
6. Edge (3, 4): No triangle formed.
7. Edge (3, 9): No triangle formed.
8. Edge (4, 5): No triangle formed.
9. Edge (6, 9): No triangle formed.
10. Edge (7, 9): No triangle formed.
11. Edge (8, 9): Node 9 and Node 8 share a connection with Node 3 forming a triangle <8, 9, 3>.
12. Edge (9, 6): No triangle formed.
13. Edge (9, 7): No triangle formed.

Therefore, the total number of triangles is [2].
The unique triangles found are <0, 2, 8> and <8, 9, 3>.
