Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will list the vertices by their degree (number of connections):
- 0: degree 3
- 1: degree 2
- 2: degree 3
- 3: degree 4
- 4: degree 2
- 5: degree 3
- 6: degree 2
- 7: degree 3
- 8: degree 2
- 9: degree 4

Now, we will relabel the vertices based on their degree (starting from 0):
- 0: degree 2
- 1: degree 0
- 2: degree 2
- 3: degree 3
- 4: degree 0
- 5: degree 2
- 6: degree 0
- 7: degree 2
- 8: degree 0
- 9: degree 3

Now, we will consider the edges based on the vertex labels:
- (0, 1) & (1, 0): shared connection with 3 forms a triangle <0, 1, 3>
- (0, 2) & (2, 0): shared connection with 3 forms a triangle <0, 2, 3>
- (0, 3) & (3, 0): no new triangle formed
- (1, 7) & (7, 1): no new triangle formed
- (2, 3) & (3, 2): no new triangle formed
- (2, 8) & (8, 2): no new triangle formed
- (3, 5) & (5, 3): shared connection with 9 forms a triangle <3, 5, 9>
- (3, 7) & (7, 3): shared connection with 9 forms a triangle <3, 7, 9>
- (4, 8) & (8, 4): no new triangle formed
- (4, 9) & (9, 4): no new triangle formed
- (5, 6) & (6, 5): shared connection with 9 forms a triangle <5, 6, 9>
- (5, 9) & (9, 5): no new triangle formed
- (6, 9) & (9, 6): no new triangle formed
- (7, 9) & (9, 7): no new triangle formed

Therefore, the total number of triangles in the graph is [4] and the unique triangles are <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, and <3, 7, 9>.
