Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Reordering the vertices based on the number of connections:
Nodes sorted by their degree:
0: 2 connections
1: 1 connection
2: 2 connections
3: 2 connections
4: 2 connections
5: 3 connections
6: 6 connections
7: 2 connections
8: 2 connections
9: 4 connections

Now, we will count the triangles following the Degree-Based Ordering method:

Triangles:
[15]

Unique triangles:
<0, 3, 9>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 6>
<2, 7, 6>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 0, 6>
<3, 9, 5>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 7, 2>
<6, 9, 5>
<7, 6, 0>
<8, 2, 5>
<9, 3, 5>
