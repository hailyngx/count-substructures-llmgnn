Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The Degree-Based Ordering method for counting triangles in the given graph is as follows:

- Node 2 has 1 connection.
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Node 4 has 2 connections.
- Node 5 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 2 connections.
- Node 6 has 2 connections.
- Node 0 has 3 connections.

Sorted nodes based on connections from least to most: 2, 3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 1, 7, 6, 0.

Now, we will count the triangles using the Degree-Based Ordering method:

1. Edge (2, 3): Both nodes 2 and 3 have 1 connection each. No triangle.
2. Edge (3, 2): Already counted in step 1. No additional triangle.
3. Edge (4, 5): Both nodes 4 and 5 have 2 connections each. No triangle.
4. Edge (5, 4): Already counted in step 3. No additional triangle.
5. Edge (8, 1): Both nodes 8 and 1 have 2 connections each. No triangle.
6. Edge (9, 1): Node 9 has 2 connections, and node 1 has 2 connections. Both share node 0. Triangle <0, 1, 9>.
7. Edge (7, 1): Node 7 has 2 connections, and node 1 has 2 connections. Both share node 0. Triangle <0, 1, 7>.
8. Edge (6, 1): Node 6 has 2 connections, and node 1 has 2 connections. Both share node 0. Triangle <0, 1, 6>.
9. Edge (0, 9): Node 0 has 3 connections, and node 9 has 2 connections. Both share nodes 6 and 7. Triangles <0, 6, 9> and <0, 7, 9>.
10. Edge (0, 7): Already counted in step 9. No additional triangle.
11. Edge (0, 6): Already counted in step 9. No additional triangle.

Total number of triangles in the graph: [5]
Unique triangles found: <0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 7, 9>.
