Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
By sorting the vertices based on their degrees, we get the following labels for the vertices:

Node 0 has degree 2

Node 1 has degree 2

Node 4 has degree 1

Node 7 has degree 3

Node 5 has degree 2

Node 8 has degree 3

Node 6 has degree 4

Node 9 has degree 4

Node 2 has degree 4

Node 3 has degree 5

Using the Degree-Based Ordering method, we can count the number of triangles in the graph.

Calculating the triangles:

For edge (0, 3): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (1, 3): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (1, 4): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (2, 3): Triangle <2, 3, 6>.

For edge (2, 6): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (2, 9): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (3, 0): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (3, 1): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (3, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 6> and <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (3, 5): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (4, 1): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (5, 3): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (5, 7): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (6, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 6> and <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (6, 7): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (6, 8): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

For edge (6, 9): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (7, 5): No triangles can be formed.

For edge (7, 6): Triangle <2, 6, 7> and <3, 6, 7>.

For edge (7, 8): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

For edge (8, 6): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

For edge (8, 7): Triangle <6, 7, 8>.

For edge (8, 9): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (9, 2): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (9, 6): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

For edge (9, 8): Triangle <2, 3, 9>.

The total number of triangles is [22].

The unique triangles found are: <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 9>, <6, 7, 8>, <3, 6, 7>.
